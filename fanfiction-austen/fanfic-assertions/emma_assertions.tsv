Character	Assertion
Emma Woodhouse	XV Emma was not required , by any subsequent discovery , to retract her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton . Her observation had been pretty correct .
Emma Woodhouse	Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview , such she appeared whenever they met again,--self - important , presuming , familiar , ignorant , and ill - bred .
Emma Woodhouse	She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs. Elton 's consequence only could surpass .
Emma Woodhouse	"He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury , as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of Miss Bates 's good - will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that Mrs. Elton 's praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being "" very pleasant and very elegantly dressed . """
Emma Woodhouse	Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended , probably , by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with , she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant ; and though the effect was agreeable , the ill - will which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma 's dislike .
Emma Woodhouse	Her manners , too -- and Mr. Elton 's , were unpleasant towards Harriet .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet 's cure ; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much.--It
Emma Woodhouse	was not to be doubted that poor Harriet 's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve , and her own share in the story , under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him , had in all likelihood been given also . She was , of course , the object of their joint dislike.-- When they had nothing else to say , it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse ; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her , found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet .
Emma Woodhouse	"Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other , but from the very first ; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration-- but without solicitation , or plea , or privilege , she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence , and about the third time of their meeting , she heard all Mrs. Elton 's knight - errantry on the subject.-- "" Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents . I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I can not think there is any danger of it , "" was Emma 's calm answer-- "" and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax 's situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown . "" "" Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	And I think she feels it .
Emma Woodhouse	I am sure she does . She is very timid and silent .
Emma Woodhouse	I like her the better for it .
Emma Woodhouse	I must confess it is a recommendation to me .
Emma Woodhouse	I am a great advocate for timidity -- and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But
Emma Woodhouse	"I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express . "" """
Emma Woodhouse	"You appear to feel a great deal -- but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax 's acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than""-- "" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act ."
Emma Woodhouse	You and I need not be afraid .
Emma Woodhouse	_ We _ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _ we _ live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient.--I
Emma Woodhouse	should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _ more _ than Jane Fairfax to partake of it .
Emma Woodhouse	I have no idea of that sort of thing .
Emma Woodhouse	It is not likely that I _ should _ , considering what I have been used to .
Emma Woodhouse	My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense .
Emma Woodhouse	Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be-- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr. Suckling , in income.--However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation .
Emma Woodhouse	My acquaintance is so very extensive , that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her , of course , very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us . I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Poor Jane Fairfax!""--thought Emma.--""You have not deserved this ."
Emma Woodhouse	You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax .
Emma Woodhouse	"Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me!-- But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman 's tongue ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma had not to listen to such paradings again -- to any so exclusively addressed to herself -- so disgustingly decorated with a "" dear Miss Woodhouse . """
Emma Woodhouse	The change on Mrs. Elton 's side soon afterwards appeared , and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs. Elton , nor , under Mrs. Elton 's guidance , the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax , and only sharing with others in a general way , in knowing what was felt , what was meditated , what was done .
Emma Woodhouse	She looked on with some amusement.--Miss
Emma Woodhouse	Emma 's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do .
Emma Woodhouse	She heard of her walking with the Eltons , sitting with the Eltons , spending a day with the Eltons !
Emma Woodhouse	This was astonishing!--She could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer .
Emma Woodhouse	""" She is a riddle , quite a riddle ! "" said she.--""To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort !"
Emma Woodhouse	""" She must have some motive , more powerful than appears , for refusing this invitation , "" was Emma 's conclusion . "" She must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the Campbells or herself ."
Emma Woodhouse	"But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle . "" Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject , before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton , Mrs. Weston ventured this apology for Jane ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" We can not suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma -- but it is better than being always at home ."
Emma Woodhouse	"We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to . "" "" You are right , Mrs. Weston , "" said Mr. Knightley warmly , "" Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton ."
Emma Woodhouse	"But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton , which nobody else pays her . """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance ; and she was herself struck by his warmth .
Emma Woodhouse	"With a faint blush , she presently replied , "" Such attentions as Mrs. Elton 's , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Mrs. Elton 's invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting . "" "" I should not wonder , "" said Mrs. Weston , "" if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt 's eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton 's civilities for her ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said , "" Another thing must be taken into consideration too -- Mrs. Elton does not talk _ to _ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _ of _ her . We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other-- a something more early implanted . We can not give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before . We feel things differently . And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to . Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton 's way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness . "" "" I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax , "" said Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	Little Henry was in her thoughts , and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say .
Emma Woodhouse	""" And yet , "" said Emma , beginning hastily and with an arch look , but soon stopping -- it was better , however , to know the worst at once-- she hurried on--""And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is ."
Emma Woodhouse	"The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other . "" Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of getting them together , or some other cause , brought the colour into his face , as he answered , "" Oh ! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand ."
Emma Woodhouse	He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston , and did not herself know what to think .
Emma Woodhouse	"In a moment he went on-- "" That will never be , however , I can assure you ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma returned her friend 's pressure with interest ; and was pleased enough to exclaim , "" You are not vain , Mr. Knightley ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I will say that for you . "" He seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased"
Emma Woodhouse	", soon afterwards said , "" So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No indeed I have not ."
Emma Woodhouse	You have scolded me too much for match - making , for me to presume to take such a liberty with you .
Emma Woodhouse	What I said just now , meant nothing . One says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning .
Emma Woodhouse	no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body .
Emma Woodhouse	"You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married . "" Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again ."
Emma Woodhouse	"The result of his reverie was , "" No , Emma , I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way , I assure you . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , "" said she , "" and you soon silenced Mr. Cole , I suppose ? """
Emma Woodhouse	He gave me a quiet hint ; I told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon and said no more .
Emma Woodhouse	I wonder how she speaks of the Coles-- what she calls them !
Emma Woodhouse	She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do for Mr. Cole ? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . Mrs. Weston , your argument weighs most with me . I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax 's mind over Mrs. Elton . I have no faith in Mrs. Elton 's acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding .
Emma Woodhouse	I can not imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , Mrs. Weston , "" said Emma triumphantly when he left them , "" what do you say now to Mr. Knightley 's marrying Jane Fairfax ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Why , really , dear Emma , I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _ not _ being in love with her , that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Do not beat me . """
Emma Woodhouse	"He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury , as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of Miss Bates 's good - will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that Mrs. Elton 's praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being "" very pleasant and very elegantly dressed .

Emma Woodhouse	You will laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--
Emma Woodhouse	And her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her .
Emma Woodhouse	Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet , ` Full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ` And waste its fragrance on the desert air . '
Emma Woodhouse	"I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express . "" """

"" "" I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax , "" said Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	VII Emma 's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day , by hearing that he was gone off to London , merely to have his hair cut . A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast , and he had sent for a chaise and set off , intending to return to dinner , but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut .
Emma Woodhouse	There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand ; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve .
Emma Woodhouse	It did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday . Vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges .
Emma Woodhouse	With the exception of this little blot , Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him .
Emma Woodhouse	"The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , "" Hum ! just the trifling , silly fellow I took him for . """
Emma Woodhouse	She had half a mind to resent ; but an instant 's observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass . Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr. and Mrs. Weston 's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune .
Emma Woodhouse	Something occurred while they were at Hartfield , to make Emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave .
Emma Woodhouse	had already taken place . The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose
Emma Woodhouse	Nothing should tempt _ her _ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father 's known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish .
Emma Woodhouse	. This lesson , she very much feared , they would receive only from herself ; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley , none of Mr. Weston .
Emma Woodhouse	But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared , that when the insult came at last , it found her very differently affected .
Emma Woodhouse	"Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and Mrs. Weston 's accounting for it with "" I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out , "" was not quite sufficient ."
Emma Woodhouse	She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again and again , she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept .
Emma Woodhouse	The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits ; and her being left in solitary grandeur , even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment , was but poor comfort .
Emma Woodhouse	"It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that "" of course it must be declined , "" she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful . She owned that , considering every thing , she was not absolutely without inclination for the party . The Coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it-- so much consideration for her father . "" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company . """
Emma Woodhouse	Upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly Mrs. Goddard , if not Mrs. Bates , might be depended on for bearing him company-- Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter 's going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him .
Emma Woodhouse	As for _ his _ going , Emma did not wish him to think it possible , the hours would be too late , and the party too numerous .
Emma Woodhouse	No more is Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	"However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr. Knightley too , to take care of her , I can not wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , sir , "" cried Mr. Weston , "" as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment , if you wish it . """
Emma Woodhouse	He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her .
Emma Woodhouse	""" You will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible ."
Emma Woodhouse	You will say that I am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _ compliments _ , of course .
Emma Woodhouse	But you will do every thing right . I need not tell you what is to be done .
Emma Woodhouse	We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday . I shall have no fears for you with him .
Emma Woodhouse	We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely .
Emma Woodhouse	And when you get there , you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again ; and you had better name an early hour .
Emma Woodhouse	"You will not like staying late . You will get very tired when tea is over . "" "" But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! no , my love ; but you will soon be tired ."
Emma Woodhouse	You will not like the noise .
Emma Woodhouse	""" But , my dear sir , "" cried Mr. Weston , "" if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles . Emma 's going away directly after tea might be giving offence . They are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body 's hurrying away is no great compliment ; and Miss Woodhouse 's doing it would be more thought of than any other person 's in the room ."
Emma Woodhouse	You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ ten _ years .
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , upon no account in the world , Mr. Weston ; I am much obliged to you for reminding me ."
Emma Woodhouse	I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain .
Emma Woodhouse	I know what worthy people they are .
Emma Woodhouse	Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor . You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- Mr. Cole is very bilious .
Emma Woodhouse	No , I would not be the means of giving them any pain .
Emma Woodhouse	My dear Emma , we must consider this .
Emma Woodhouse	I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish .
Emma Woodhouse	You will not regard being tired .
Emma Woodhouse	"You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends . "" "" Oh yes , papa ."
Emma Woodhouse	I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston , but on your account .
Emma Woodhouse	I am only afraid of your sitting up for me .
Emma Woodhouse	I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard .
Emma Woodhouse	She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort .
Emma Woodhouse	"You must promise me not to sit up . "" He did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual ."
Emma Woodhouse	XII Till now that she was threatened with its loss , Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _ first _ with Mr. Knightley , first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been.--Long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella .
Emma Woodhouse	She had herself been first with him for many years past .
Emma Woodhouse	She had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared . In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly , exclusively , passionately loved by Mr. Knightley . _ She _ could not .
Emma Woodhouse	She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _ her _ .
Emma Woodhouse	She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.-- How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates ! How directly , how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not
Emma Woodhouse	too strongly for the offence -- but far , far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear - sighted goodwill.-- She had no hope , nothing to deserve the name of hope , that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question ; but there was a hope ( at times a slight one , at times much stronger , ) that Harriet might have deceived herself , and be overrating his regard for _ her_.--Wish it she must , for his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself , but his remaining single all his life . Could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father , the same Mr. Knightley to all the world ; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured.--Marriage , in fact , would not do for her .
Emma Woodhouse	It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father , and with what she felt for him .
Emma Woodhouse	Nothing should separate her from her father .
Emma Woodhouse	She would not marry , even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley .
Emma Woodhouse	It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- He was expected back every day . The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course .
Emma Woodhouse	In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet 's confidence . To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _ one _ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma 's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs. Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates 's , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates 's parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .
Emma Woodhouse	A little curiosity Emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related .
Emma Woodhouse	"Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement 's becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:-- but Mr. Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for "" such things , "" he observed , "" always got about . """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma smiled , and felt that Mr. Weston had very good reason for saying so .
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Fairfax 's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing ; she had drawn back and declined at first , but , on being pressed had yielded ; and , in the course of their drive , Mrs. Weston had , by gentle encouragement , overcome so much of her embarrassment , as to bring her to converse on the important subject .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject .
Emma Woodhouse	""" On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months , "" continued Mrs. Weston , "" she was energetic ."
Emma Woodhouse	` I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'-- and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart .
Emma Woodhouse	"! "" said Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ? "" "" Wrong !"
Emma Woodhouse	No one , I believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself . ` The consequence , ' said she , ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought .
Emma Woodhouse	I never can be blameless .
Emma Woodhouse	I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right ; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken , and the kindness I am now receiving , is what my conscience tells me ought not to be . '
Emma Woodhouse	` Do not imagine , madam , ' she continued , ` that I was taught wrong . Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up .
Emma Woodhouse	The error has been all my own ; and I do assure you that , with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give , I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell . '
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Poor girl ! "" said Emma again ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" She loves him then excessively , I suppose ."
Emma Woodhouse	"It must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement . Her affection must have overpowered her judgment . "" "" Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I am afraid , "" returned Emma , sighing , "" that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" On your side , my love , it was very innocently done ."
Emma Woodhouse	But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before .
Emma Woodhouse	"One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in , "" she said , "" was that of making her _ unreasonable _ ."
Emma Woodhouse	The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been-- that had been -- hard for him to bear . ` I did not make the allowances , ' said she , ` which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits-- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first . ' She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good . She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" If I did not know her to be happy now , "" said Emma , seriously , "" which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , I could not bear these thanks;--for , oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ) , this is all to be forgotten .
Emma Woodhouse	You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars .
Emma Woodhouse	"I am sure she is very good-- I hope she will be very happy . It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers . "" Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston . She thought well of Frank in almost every respect ; and , what was more , she loved him very much , and her defence was , therefore , earnest . She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection-- but she had too much to urge for Emma 's attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs. Weston ended with , "" We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come , "" she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for . "" Are you well , my Emma ? "" was Mrs. Weston 's parting question ."
Emma Woodhouse	I am always well , you know .
Emma Woodhouse	"Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible . "" Mrs. Weston 's communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax ."
Emma Woodhouse	She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause . Had she followed Mr. Knightley 's known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now.--Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax 's confidence on this important matter-- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane 's feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill 's .
Emma Woodhouse	Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst .
Emma Woodhouse	She must have been a perpetual enemy .
Emma Woodhouse	They never could have been all three together , without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax 's peace in a thousand instances ; and on Box Hill , perhaps , it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more .
Emma Woodhouse	The weather added what it could of gloom . A cold stormy rain set in , and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs , which the wind was despoiling , and the length of the day , which only made such cruel sights the longer visible . The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse , and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter 's side , and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before .
Emma Woodhouse	It reminded her of their first forlorn tete - a - tete , on the evening of Mrs. Weston 's wedding - day ; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then , soon after tea , and dissipated every melancholy fancy .
Emma Woodhouse	The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter , had proved erroneous ; no friends had deserted them , no pleasures had been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction .
Emma Woodhouse	The prospect before her now , was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled-- that might not be even partially brightened .
Emma Woodhouse	If all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends , Hartfield must be comparatively deserted ; and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness .
Emma Woodhouse	The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself ; and Mrs. Weston 's heart and time would be occupied by it .
Emma Woodhouse	They should lose her ; and , probably , in great measure , her husband
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!-- No longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their's!--How was it to be endured ? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet 's sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in Harriet 's society all that he wanted ; if Harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing Emma 's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ? When it came to such a pitch as this , she was not able to refrain from a start , or a heavy sigh , or even from walking about the room for a few seconds -- and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn , was in the resolution of her own better conduct , and the hope that , however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past , it would yet find her more rational , more acquainted with herself , and leave her less to regret when it were gone .
Emma Woodhouse	Not unfrequently , through Emma 's persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card - table for him . Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; and by Mr. Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse 's drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away .
Emma Woodhouse	She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse 's kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside . These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father 's sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston .
Emma Woodhouse	She was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated .
Emma Woodhouse	As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty . A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion .
Emma Woodhouse	She was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired .
Emma Woodhouse	She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .
Emma Woodhouse	She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith 's conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement . Encouragement should be given . Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions . The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her .
Emma Woodhouse	The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm .
Emma Woodhouse	They were a family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell -- very creditably , she believed -- she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect . _
Emma Woodhouse	She _ would notice her ; she would improve her ;
Emma Woodhouse	she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners .
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Bates , let Emma help you to a _ little _ bit of tart -- a _ very _ little bit .
Emma Woodhouse	"I do not think it could disagree with you . "" Emma allowed her father to talk -- but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy ."
Emma Woodhouse	The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions .
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last !
Emma Woodhouse	Frank 's was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance . But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma said it would be awkward ; Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper ; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health
Emma Woodhouse	I could not bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong .
Emma Woodhouse	She would catch a dreadful cold .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma demurred ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , no , "" said she , "" you are quite unreasonable ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" There is no denying it , "" he replied . "" I agree with you exactly ."
Emma Woodhouse	A crowd in a little room -- Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self - willed , and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest . Had she intended ever to _ marry _ him , it might have been worth while to pause and consider , and try to understand the value of his preference , and the character of his temper ; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance , he was
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , Miss Woodhouse , "" he almost immediately began , "" your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope , by the terrors of my father 's little rooms . I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a thought of my father 's , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon ."
Emma Woodhouse	"May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ? "" "" The Crown ! "" """
Emma Woodhouse	Yes ; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied . This is what we all feel .
Emma Woodhouse	you were perfectly right !
Emma Woodhouse	Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _ any _ _ thing _ to like to yield .
Emma Woodhouse	Is not it a good exchange?--You
Emma Woodhouse	"consent-- I hope you consent ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr. and Mrs. Weston do not ."
Emma Woodhouse	I think it admirable ; and , as far as I can answer for myself , shall be most happy --
Emma Woodhouse	She was obliged to repeat and explain it , before it was fully comprehended ; and then , being quite new , farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable .
Emma Woodhouse	I have often known it done myself .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Have you indeed , sir?--Bless me !"
Emma Woodhouse	I never could have supposed it .
Emma Woodhouse	But I live out of the world , and am often astonished at what I hear .
Emma Woodhouse	"If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done . "" "" But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited-- "" "" Oh ! "" interrupted Emma , "" there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" So they will , my dear ."
Emma Woodhouse	If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired -- but is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted ?
Emma Woodhouse	I doubt it .
Emma Woodhouse	"I do not know her , even by sight . "" "" I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs. Weston 's care ."
Emma Woodhouse	Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ?
Emma Woodhouse	"How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ! """
Emma Woodhouse	I shall never forget it .
Emma Woodhouse	"I hope whenever poor Isabella 's little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry . "" "" My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment , "" said Frank Churchill , "" examining the capabilities of the house . I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . I was desired to say so from both ."
Emma Woodhouse	"It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . They can do nothing satisfactorily without you . "" Emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown ."
Emma Woodhouse	"There were Mr. and Mrs. Weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect . "" Emma , "" said she , "" this paper is worse than I expected ."
Emma Woodhouse	in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage ; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper .
Emma Woodhouse	"And Mr. Weston at the same time , walking briskly with long steps through the passage , was calling out , "" You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Well -- if you please , "" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating , "" if you think she will be of any use . "" "" You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates , "" said Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates .
Emma Woodhouse	I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk .
Emma Woodhouse	And I need not bring the whole family , you know .
Emma Woodhouse	I beg your pardon , sir .
Emma Woodhouse	I did not immediately recollect .
Emma Woodhouse	Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both .
Emma Woodhouse	"The party did not break up without Emma 's being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening , nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife , "" He has asked her , my dear ."
Emma Woodhouse	` If _ Miss _ _ Taylor _ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir . '
Emma Woodhouse	"How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ! """
Emma Woodhouse	Poor little Emma !
Emma Woodhouse	You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry 's great attention .
Emma Woodhouse	You will see nothing of it by candlelight .
Emma Woodhouse	"We shall not be many , you know . """
Emma Woodhouse	XVI It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting .
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate.-- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke . She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella 's invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister 's side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable.-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse 's carriage.--It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square .
Emma Woodhouse	Now Emma could , indeed , enjoy Mr. Knightley 's visits ; now she could talk , and she could listen with true happiness , unchecked by that sense of injustice , of guilt , of something most painful , which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her , how much might at that moment , and at a little distance , be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself .
Emma Woodhouse	The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard 's , or in London , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma 's sensations ; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself
Emma Woodhouse	She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied .
Emma Woodhouse	There was a communication before her , one which _ she _ only could be competent to make-- the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at
Emma Woodhouse	present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well .
Emma Woodhouse	No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved-- and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight , at least , of leisure and peace of mind , to crown every warmer , but more agitating , delight , should be hers .
Emma Woodhouse	She soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.-- She ought to go -- and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill .
Emma Woodhouse	"It would be a _ secret _ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate . She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.-- The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name.-- She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , "" Beg her to walk up;""--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging ."
Emma Woodhouse	"There was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.-- She came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone , "" This is most kind , indeed!--Miss Woodhouse , it is impossible for me to express -- I hope you will believe -- Excuse me for being so entirely without words . "" Emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of Mrs. Elton 's voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma could have wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere ; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body ; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness ,
Emma Woodhouse	She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton 's thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits
Emma Woodhouse	"; it was being in Miss Fairfax 's confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people . Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady 's replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods , "" We can finish this some other time , you know ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" And again , on Emma 's merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates 's knitting , she added , in a half whisper , "" I mentioned no _ names _ , you will observe.--Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	"I managed it extremely well . """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma could not doubt .
Emma Woodhouse	"When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs. Weston , she found herself abruptly addressed with , "" Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit?--(here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Upon my word , Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!-- Oh ! if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst!""-- And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma , whispered farther , "" We do not say a word of any _ assistance _ that Perry might have ; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh ! no ; Perry shall have all the credit ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , "" she shortly afterwards began , "" since the party to Box Hill ."
Emma Woodhouse	But yet I think there was something wanting .
Emma Woodhouse	"What say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to Box Hill again , while the fine weather lasts?-- It must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _ one _ exception . "" Soon after this Miss Bates came in , and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself , resulting , she supposed , from doubt of what might be said , and impatience to say every thing ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness.--It is impossible to say --"
Emma Woodhouse	Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane 's prospects-- that is , I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--
Emma Woodhouse	"How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.-- Such a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes , indeed.-- Charming young man!--that is -- so very friendly ; I mean good Mr. Perry!-- such attention to Jane!""--And from her great , her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there , Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane , from the vicarage quarter , which was now graciously overcome.-- After a few whispers , indeed , which placed it beyond a guess , Mrs. Elton , speaking louder , said , "" Yes , here I am , my good friend ; and here I have been so long , that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that I am waiting for my lord and master . He promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you ."
Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr. Elton 's time is so engaged .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon my word it is , Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning to night.--There is no end of people 's coming to him , on some pretence or other.--The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion ."
Emma Woodhouse	"They seem not able to do any thing without him.--`Upon my word , Mr. E. , ' I often say , ` rather you than I.-- I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if I had half so many applicants . '--Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.--However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all . "" And putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma--""A congratulatory visit , you know.--Oh ! yes , quite indispensable . "" Miss Bates looked about her , so happily!-- "" He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley ; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.--Mr"
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma would not have smiled for the world , and only said , "" Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk . """
Emma Woodhouse	Weston and Cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way
Emma Woodhouse	""" Have not you mistaken the day ? "" said Emma . "" I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to - morrow.--Mr"
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do believe , "" she continued , "" this is the most troublesome parish that ever was . We never heard of such things at Maple Grove ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Your parish there was small , "" said Jane ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon my word , my dear , I do not know , for I never heard the subject talked of ."
Emma Woodhouse	"My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate , however , that _ some _ people may not think _ you _ perfection already.--But hush!-- not a word , if you please . """
Emma Woodhouse	It seemed an unnecessary caution ; Jane was wanting to give her words , not to Mrs. Elton , but to Miss Woodhouse , as the latter plainly saw .
Emma Woodhouse	"The wish of distinguishing her , as far as civility permitted , was very evident , though it could not often proceed beyond a look . Mr. Elton made his appearance . His lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity . "" Very pretty , sir , upon my word ; to send me on here , to be an encumbrance to my friends , so long before you vouchsafe to come!-- But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with . You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.-- Here have I been sitting this hour , giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience -- for who can say , you know , how soon it may be wanted ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Donwell ! "" cried his wife.--""My dear Mr. E. , you have not been to Donwell!--You"
Emma Woodhouse	mean the Crown ; you come from the meeting at the Crown .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" No , no , that 's to - morrow ; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to - day on"
Emma Woodhouse	I went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill - usage , ) which made it so much the worse .
Emma Woodhouse	I assure you I am not at all pleased .
Emma Woodhouse	The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.-- Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone .
Emma Woodhouse	"Perhaps to Hartfield , perhaps to the Abbey Mill , perhaps into his woods.-- Miss Woodhouse , this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain it ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary , indeed , and that she had not a syllable to say for him . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I can not imagine , "" said Mrs. Elton , ( feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do , ) "" I can not imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world !"
Emma Woodhouse	The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E. , he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;-- and his servants forgot it .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly .
Emma Woodhouse	In all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr. Elton , if not towards William Larkins .
Emma Woodhouse	"She was pleased , on taking leave , to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say , "" It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility ."
Emma Woodhouse	Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! "" cried Jane , with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure--""there would have been no danger ."
Emma Woodhouse	The danger would have been of my wearying you .
Emma Woodhouse	You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest-- .
Emma Woodhouse	Indeed , Miss Woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly , ) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to -- I have not time for half that I could wish to say .
Emma Woodhouse	I long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself .
Emma Woodhouse	I feel it so very due .
Emma Woodhouse	"But , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend-- "" "" Oh ! you are too scrupulous , indeed you are , "" cried Emma warmly , and taking her hand . "" You owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even-- "" "" You are very kind , but I know what my manners were to you.--"
Emma Woodhouse	So cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It
Emma Woodhouse	was a life of deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Pray say no more . I feel that all the apologies should be on my side ."
Emma Woodhouse	I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" And the next news , I suppose , will be , that we are to lose you-- just as I begin to know you . "" "" Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	"I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell . "" "" Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps , "" replied Emma , smiling--""but , excuse me , it must be thought of ."
Emma Woodhouse	"The smile was returned as Jane answered , "" You are very right ; it has been thought of ."
Emma Woodhouse	And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ) , that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Thank you , thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured of.-- Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	"if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!-- Good - bye , good - bye . """
Emma Woodhouse	VIII The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma 's thoughts all the evening .
Emma Woodhouse	How it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell .
Emma Woodhouse	They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed
Emma Woodhouse	A whole evening of back - gammon with her father , was felicity to it .
Emma Woodhouse	_ There _ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach .
Emma Woodhouse	As a daughter , she hoped she was not without a heart .
Emma Woodhouse	"She hoped no one could have said to her , "" How could you be so unfeeling to your father?-- I must , I will tell you truths while I can . """
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Bates should never again -- no , never !
Emma Woodhouse	If attention , in future , could do away the past , she might hope to be forgiven . She had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious .
Emma Woodhouse	In the warmth of true contrition , she would call upon her the very next morning , and it should be the beginning , on her side , of a regular , equal , kindly intercourse .
Emma Woodhouse	She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her . It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit .
Emma Woodhouse	She had no objection .
Emma Woodhouse	She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence , so justly and truly hers .
Emma Woodhouse	Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not .
Emma Woodhouse	She had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule .
Emma Woodhouse	There was a bustle on her approach ; a good deal of moving and talking .
Emma Woodhouse	She heard Miss Bates 's voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon . The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room . Jane
Emma Woodhouse	she
Emma Woodhouse	"had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , "" Well , my dear , I shall _ say _ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough . "" Poor old Mrs. Bates , civil and humble as usual , looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on . "" I am afraid Jane is not very well , "" said she , "" but I do not know ; they _ tell _ me she is well ."
Emma Woodhouse	I dare say my daughter will be here presently , Miss Woodhouse .
Emma Woodhouse	I hope you find a chair .
Emma Woodhouse	I wish Hetty had not gone .
Emma Woodhouse	I am very little able -- Have you a chair , ma'am ?
Emma Woodhouse	Do you sit where you like ?
Emma Woodhouse	"I am sure she will be here presently . "" Emma seriously hoped she would . She had a moment 's fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her ."
Emma Woodhouse	"But Miss Bates soon came--""Very happy and obliged""--but Emma 's conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner . A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ah ! Miss Woodhouse , how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard-- and are come to give us joy ."
Emma Woodhouse	This does not seem much like joy , indeed , in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be very trying for us to part with her , after having had her so long , and she has a dreadful headache just now , writing all the morning:-- such long letters , you know , to be written to Colonel Campbell , and Mrs. Dixon . ` My dear , ' said I , ` you will blind yourself'-- for tears were in her eyes perpetually .
Emma Woodhouse	It is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , I suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , Miss Woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing her tears)--but , poor dear soul ! if you were to see what a headache she has .
Emma Woodhouse	To look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation . You will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room-- I want her to lie down upon the bed .
Emma Woodhouse	` My dear , ' said I , ` I shall say you are laid down upon the bed : ' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room .
Emma Woodhouse	She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her .
Emma Woodhouse	You were kept waiting at the door -- I was quite ashamed-- but somehow there was a little bustle -- for it so happened that we had not heard the knock , and
Emma Woodhouse	till you were on the stairs , we did not know any body was coming .
Emma Woodhouse	` It is only Mrs. Cole , ' said I , ` depend upon it .
Emma Woodhouse	` Well , ' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now .
Emma Woodhouse	But then Patty came in , and said it was you .
Emma Woodhouse	` Oh ! ' said I , ` it is Miss Woodhouse : I am sure you will like to see her .
Emma Woodhouse	'-- ` I can see nobody , ' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were .
Emma Woodhouse	` If you must go , my dear , ' said I , ` you must , and I will say you are laid down upon the bed . '
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma was most sincerely interested ."
Emma Woodhouse	Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself .
Emma Woodhouse	"She spoke as she felt , with earnest regret and solicitude -- sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for Miss Fairfax 's advantage and comfort as possible . "" It must be a severe trial to them all . She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell 's return . "" "" So very kind ! "" replied Miss Bates ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" But you are always kind . "" There was no bearing such an "" always ; "" and to break through her dreadful gratitude , Emma made the direct inquiry of-- "" Where -- may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going ? "" "" To a Mrs. Smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children . Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , Mrs. Suckling 's own family , and Mrs. Bragge 's ; but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mrs. Elton , I suppose , has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes-- "" "" Yes , our good Mrs. Elton ."
Emma Woodhouse	She would not let Jane say , ` No ; ' for when Jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at Donwell , ) when Jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell 's return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over again -- and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than I did .
Emma Woodhouse	Quite a surprize to me !
Emma Woodhouse	"I had not the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside , and told her at once , that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge 's situation , she had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it till it was all settled . "" """
Emma Woodhouse	` You _ must _ _ all _ spend your evening with us , ' said she--`I positively must have you _ all _ come . '
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , not Mr. Knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though I thought he would come , because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him off , he did not;--but my mother , and Jane , and I , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had ."
Emma Woodhouse	Such kind friends , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one must always find agreeable , though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning 's party .
Emma Woodhouse	Even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and I can not say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it .
Emma Woodhouse	However , _ I _ shall always think it a very pleasant party , and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Miss Fairfax , I suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ? "" "" I dare say she had ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Whenever the time may come , it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends -- but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible -- I mean , as to the character and manners of the family . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse ."
Emma Woodhouse	her salary!-- I really can not venture to name her salary to you , Miss Woodhouse .
Emma Woodhouse	"Even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane . "" "" Ah !"
Emma Woodhouse	"madam , "" cried Emma , "" if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself , I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You are so noble in your ideas ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you ?"
Emma Woodhouse	My poor mother does not know how to bear it .
Emma Woodhouse	So then , I try to put it out of her thoughts , and say , Come ma'am , do not let us think about it any more .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes ; Jane says she is sure they will ; but yet , this is such a situation as she can not feel herself justified in declining . I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton , and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it !"
Emma Woodhouse	It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh ! no , now I recollect , now I have it ; something happened before tea , but not that .
Emma Woodhouse	Poor old John , I have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty - seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed - ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints-- I must go and see him to - day ; and so will Jane , I am sure ,
Emma Woodhouse	And poor John 's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he can not keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr. Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond .
Emma Woodhouse	"It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton . "" Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill 's going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence ."
Emma Woodhouse	There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest , and it caught Emma 's attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind .
Emma Woodhouse	"The contrast between Mrs. Churchill 's importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax 's , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman 's destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates 's saying , "" Aye , I see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte ."
Emma Woodhouse	Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.-- ` You must go , ' said she .
Emma Woodhouse	` You and I must part .
Emma Woodhouse	You will have no business here.--Let it stay , however , ' said she ; ` give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back .
Emma Woodhouse	"I shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties . '-- And to this day , I do believe , she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter 's . "" Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough ; and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave ."
Emma Woodhouse	XIII There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John Knightley , in this short visit to Hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister .
Emma Woodhouse	How they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter 's carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also .
Emma Woodhouse	The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma called on her the next day , and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls . She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat : Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection , Mr. Perry was talked of , and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement , though she could not speak of her loss without many tears .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in Mrs. Goddard 's unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton 's would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much . She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard 's door , when she was met by Mr. Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid-- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield-- they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for . They joined company and proceeded together .
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma was just describing the nature of her friend 's complaint;-- "" a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them . """
Emma Woodhouse	Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend .
Emma Woodhouse	"Let me entreat you to run no risks . Why does not Perry see her ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma , who was not really at all frightened herself , tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard 's experience and care ; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away , which she would rather feed and assist than not , she added soon afterwards -- as if quite another subject , "" It is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston ."
Emma Woodhouse	But , upon my word , Mr. Elton , in your case , I should certainly excuse myself .
Emma Woodhouse	"You appear to me a little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to - morrow will bring , I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to - night . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her 's , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;-- but Emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being "" very cold , certainly very cold , "" and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" You do quite right , "" said she;--""we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston ."
Emma Woodhouse	But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr. Elton 's only objection , and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction .
Emma Woodhouse	It was a done thing ; Mr. Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , "" said she to herself , "" this is most strange!--After I had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination-- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with Mr. Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with Harriet ; but still , he can not refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked . What a strange thing love is !"
Emma Woodhouse	"he can see ready wit in Harriet , but will not dine alone for her . "" Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard 's for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour ."
Emma Woodhouse	"With men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works . "" "" Mr. Elton 's manners are not perfect , "" replied Emma ; "" but where there is a wish to please , one ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great deal ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes , "" said Mr. John Knightley presently , with some slyness , "" he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Me ! "" she replied with a smile of astonishment , "" are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton 's object ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Such an imagination has crossed me , I own , Emma ; and if it never occurred to you before , you may as well take it into consideration now ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea ! "" """
Emma Woodhouse	I do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly .
Emma Woodhouse	I think your manners to him encouraging .
Emma Woodhouse	I speak as a friend , Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	You had better look about you , and ascertain what you do , and what you mean to do .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I thank you ; but I assure you you are quite mistaken ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Elton and I are very good friends , and nothing more ; "" and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel . He said no more ."
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the "" Very true , my love , "" which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all . She could not be complying , she dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence ."
Emma Woodhouse	She allowed him to talk , and arranged the glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her lips .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her .
Emma Woodhouse	"She had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , "" Much the same-- not better . "" """
Emma Woodhouse	My
Emma Woodhouse	", "" said she presently , "" was not so pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better ' was _ my _ answer . """
Emma Woodhouse	no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard 's door , which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress , I was told that Miss Smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse . Very much grieved and concerned-- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma smiled and answered--""My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , I hope ; but not even I can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Perry has been with her , as you probably heard . "" "" Yes -- I imagined -- that is -- I did not-- "" "" He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things , and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment . "" What an excellent device , "" said he , "" the use of a sheepskin for carriages ."
Emma Woodhouse	At another time Emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at Mr. Elton 's spirits for other feelings .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Weston 's dining - room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , I would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two .
Emma Woodhouse	I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma , ) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr. Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I know nothing of the large parties of London , sir -- I never dine with any body . "" """
Emma Woodhouse	( in a tone of wonder and pity , ) I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery .
Emma Woodhouse	Concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to Hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt 's arms .
Emma Woodhouse	It did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity .
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby , "" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces . As to men and women , our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard to these children , I observe we never disagree ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" To be sure -- our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong . "" "" Yes , "" said he , smiling--""and reason good ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child ."
Emma Woodhouse	"This had just taken place and with great cordiality , when John Knightley made his appearance , and "" How d'ye do , George ? "" and "" John , how are you ? "" succeeded in the true English style , burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference , the real attachment which would have led either of them , if requisite , to do every thing for the good of the other . The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other . The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits , but principally of those of the elder , whose temper was by much the most communicative , and who was always the greater talker . As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" My poor dear Isabella , "" said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children--""How long it is , how terribly long since you were here ! And how tired you must be after your journey !"
Emma Woodhouse	You must go to bed early , my dear -- and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it , sir -- or we should not have gone ."
Emma Woodhouse	my dear , but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good ; and as to myself , I have been long perfectly convinced , though perhaps I never told you so before , that the sea is very rarely of use to any body .
Emma Woodhouse	Poor Perry is bilious , and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country .
Emma Woodhouse	"He will be so pleased to see my little ones . "" "" I hope he will be here to - morrow , for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence ."
Emma Woodhouse	Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr. Wingfield 's , which we have been applying at times ever since August .
Emma Woodhouse	But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago .
Emma Woodhouse	The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest .
Emma Woodhouse	I should be unwilling , I own , to live in any other part of the town;-- there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in : but _ we _ are so remarkably airy!--Mr . Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air .
Emma Woodhouse	"You make the best of it-- but after you have been a week at Hartfield , you are all of you different creatures ; you do not look like the same . Now I can not say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present . "" "" I am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but I assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere , I am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming ."
Emma Woodhouse	I am sorry to find , my love , that my father does not think you looking well -- but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued .
Emma Woodhouse	"I could have wished , however , as you know , that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you left home . "" "" My dear Isabella,""--exclaimed he hastily--""pray do not concern yourself about my looks ."
Emma Woodhouse	Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children , and let me look as I chuse .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother , "" cried Emma , "" about your friend Mr. Graham 's intending to have a bailiff from Scotland , to look after his new estate ."
Emma Woodhouse	What will it answer ? Will not the old prejudice be too strong ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" And she talked in this way so long and successfully that , when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister , she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella 's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax ; and Jane Fairfax , though no great favourite with her in general , she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" That sweet , amiable Jane Fairfax ! "" said Mrs. John Knightley.-- "" It is so long since I have seen her , except now and then for a moment accidentally in town !"
Emma Woodhouse	What happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt , when she comes to visit them !
Emma Woodhouse	I always regret excessively on dear Emma 's account that she can not be more at Highbury ; but now their daughter is married , I suppose Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all .
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added , "" Our little friend Harriet Smith , however , is just such another pretty kind of young person . You will like Harriet ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I know there is such an idea with many people , but indeed it is quite a mistake , sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there , never found the least inconvenience from the mud ; and Mr. Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy ; and I am sure he may be depended on , for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air , and his own brother and family have been"
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" You should have gone to Cromer , my dear , if you went anywhere.-- Perry was a week at Cromer once , and he holds it to be the best of all the sea - bathing places ."
Emma Woodhouse	It seemed to him a very ill - judged measure .
Emma Woodhouse	"Why does he make it any business of his , to wonder at what I do?-- at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed , I hope , the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.-- I want his directions no more than his drugs . "" He paused-- and growing cooler in a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , "" If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty , I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" True , true , "" cried Mr. Knightley , with most ready interposition-- "" very true . That 's a consideration indeed.--But John , as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , I can not conceive any difficulty ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path . . . . The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps . I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion . "" Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;-- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it ."
Emma Woodhouse	"This had just taken place and with great cordiality , when John Knightley made his appearance , and "" How d'ye do , George ? "" and "" John , how are you ? "" succeeded in the true English style , burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference , the real attachment which would have led either of them , if requisite , to do every thing for the good of the other . The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other . The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits , but principally of those of the elder , whose temper was by much the most communicative , and who was always the greater talker . As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is not very likely , my dear , that bathing should have been of use to her -- and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation , I would have spoken to-- "" You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates , "" said Emma , "" I have not heard one inquiry after them . """
Emma Woodhouse	the good Bateses -- I am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters .
Emma Woodhouse	Good old Mrs. Bates -- I will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.-- And that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!-- How are they , sir ?
Emma Woodhouse	But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago .
Emma Woodhouse	""" That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention ."
Emma Woodhouse	Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season .
Emma Woodhouse	Our part of London is very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London in general , my dear sir .
Emma Woodhouse	IX Emma 's pensive meditations , as she walked home , were not interrupted ; but on entering the parlour , she found those who must rouse her .
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence , and were sitting with her father.--Mr . Knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said , "" I would not go away without seeing you , but I have no time to spare , and therefore must now be gone directly ."
Emma Woodhouse	Have you any thing to send or say , besides the ` love , ' which nobody carries ?
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself . Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again . While he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going-- her father began his inquiries .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , my dear , and did you get there safely?--And how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming ."
Emma Woodhouse	Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates , Mr. Knightley , as I told you before .
Emma Woodhouse	"She is always so attentive to them ! """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma 's colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at Mr. Knightley.--
Emma Woodhouse	It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour , as if his eyes received the truth from her 's , and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.-- He looked at her with a glow of regard .
Emma Woodhouse	She was warmly gratified-- and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;-- whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say-- she might , perhaps , have rather offered it -- but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips-- when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done ,
Emma Woodhouse	she could not perceive.--He would have judged better , she thought ,
Emma Woodhouse	whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more.-- It was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature.-- She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax 's situation with Mr. Knightley.-- Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it might have happened at a better time -- and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them half an hour , she found .
Emma Woodhouse	It was a pity that she had not come back earlier !
Emma Woodhouse	In the hope of diverting her father 's thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley 's going to London ; and going so suddenly ; and going on horseback , which she knew would be all very bad ; Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax , and her dependence on the effect was justified ; it supplied a very useful check,-- interested , without disturbing him .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled ."
Emma Woodhouse	You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us .
Emma Woodhouse	How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both . It was also a very early speculation with Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	The character of Mrs. Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed .
Emma Woodhouse	She saw in a moment all the possible good .
Emma Woodhouse	All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance .
Emma Woodhouse	At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma 's side .
Emma Woodhouse	It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet 's opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield .
Emma Woodhouse	He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it .
Emma Woodhouse	He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them . Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful .
Emma Woodhouse	To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name-- mentioning that she had Mr. Perry 's decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly ,
Emma Woodhouse	she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted .
Emma Woodhouse	In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs. Bates 's , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her-- but it would not do;--Miss
Emma Woodhouse	Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons , the Mrs. Perrys , and the Mrs. Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself-- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece 's appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing:-- Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note .
Emma Woodhouse	"In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but "" dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing . """
Emma Woodhouse	When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together-- that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _ her _ .
Emma Woodhouse	She was sorry , very sorry .
Emma Woodhouse	Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston 's friends were all made happy by her safety ; and if the satisfaction of her well - doing could be increased to Emma , it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl . She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston . She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her , hereafter , with either of Isabella 's sons ; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Poor child ! "" cried Emma ; "" at that rate , what will become of her ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"I , who am owing all my happiness to _ you _ , would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them ? "" Emma laughed , and replied : "" But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people ."
Emma Woodhouse	I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Do you?--I have no doubt ."
Emma Woodhouse	Nature gave you understanding:-- Miss Taylor gave you principles .
Emma Woodhouse	You must have done well .
Emma Woodhouse	It was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me?-- and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner .
Emma Woodhouse	I do not believe I did you any good .
Emma Woodhouse	The good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me . I could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I am sure you were of use to me , "" cried Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I was very often influenced rightly by you -- oftener than I would own at the time ."
Emma Woodhouse	I am very sure you did me good .
Emma Woodhouse	"And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen . "" "" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks--`Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor 's leave'--something which , you knew , I did not approve ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance . "" "" ` Mr. Knightley . '--You always called me , ` Mr. Knightley ; ' and , from habit , it has not so very formal"
Emma Woodhouse	I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I remember once calling you ` George , ' in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago . I did it because I thought it would offend you ; but , as you made no objection , I never did it again ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" And can not you call me ` George ' now ? "" "" Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but ` Mr. Knightley . ' I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton , by calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise , "" she added presently , laughing and blushing--""I will promise to call you once by your Christian name . I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better , for worse . "" Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith ; but it was too tender a subject.--She"
Emma Woodhouse	could
Emma Woodhouse	This , on his side , might merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their friendship were declining .
Emma Woodhouse	She was aware herself , that , parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not have rested , as it now almost wholly did , on Isabella 's letters .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma 's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by Harriet 's being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .
Emma Woodhouse	""" John does not even mention your friend , "" said Mr. Knightley ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Here is his answer , if you like to see it . "" It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned .
Emma Woodhouse	""" John enters like a brother into my happiness , "" continued Mr. Knightley , "" but he is no complimenter ; and though I well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise . But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" He writes like a sensible man , "" replied Emma , when she had read the letter ."
Emma Woodhouse	"It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already . Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him . "" """
Emma Woodhouse	My Emma , he means no such thing .
Emma Woodhouse	"He only means-- "" "" He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two , "" interrupted she , with a sort of serious smile--""much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma , my dear Emma-- "" "" Oh ! "" she cried with more thorough gaiety , "" if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion ."
Emma Woodhouse	Depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing _ you _ justice .
Emma Woodhouse	He will think all the happiness , all the advantage , on your side of the question ; all the merit on mine .
Emma Woodhouse	I wish I may not sink into ` poor Emma ' with him at once.-- His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Ah ! "" he cried , "" I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together ."
Emma Woodhouse	I am amused by one part of John 's letter-- did you notice it?--where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" If I understand your brother , he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying ."
Emma Woodhouse	He had no idea of me .
Emma Woodhouse	"He seems perfectly unprepared for that . "" "" Yes , yes -- but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings ."
Emma Woodhouse	What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.-- But it was so , I suppose .
Emma Woodhouse	I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day .
Emma Woodhouse	I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual .
Emma Woodhouse	I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` Uncle seems always tired now . '
Emma Woodhouse	As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse 's visits , Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause , resolved first to announce it at home , and then at Randalls.-- But how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself to do it , in such an hour of Mr. Knightley 's absence , or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her , and she must have put it off ; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time , and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced to speak , and to speak cheerfully too . She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself .
Emma Woodhouse	She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all-- she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person 's company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston , best in the world . Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it .
Emma Woodhouse	She was reminded , more than once , of having always said she would never marry , and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single ; and told of poor Isabella , and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston , whose marriages taking them from Hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from Hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?-- He would not deny that he did , she was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him?-- Who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes
Emma Woodhouse	To Emma 's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley 's , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion.-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs. Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one--
Emma Woodhouse	well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse 's mind.--It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other-- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place . Mrs. Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield ! And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable!-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband 's plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Elton cared little about it , compared with his wife ; he only hoped "" the young lady 's pride would now be contented ; "" and supposed "" she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ; "" and , on the point of living at Hartfield , could daringly exclaim , "" Rather he than I!""-- But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--""Poor Knightley !"
Emma Woodhouse	was extremely concerned ; for , though very eccentric , he had a thousand good qualities.--
Emma Woodhouse	Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _ her _ .
Emma Woodhouse	But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan , living together .
Emma Woodhouse	It would never do . She knew a family near Maple Grove who had tried it , and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter .
Emma Woodhouse	The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs. Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte . Busy as he was , however , the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again .
Emma Woodhouse	That she was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston had been delighted before , and was delighted again ; Emma joined her in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of the
Emma Woodhouse	""" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ , "" said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , "" the person has not chosen ill ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is not fair , "" said Emma , in a whisper ; "" mine was a random guess ."
Emma Woodhouse	"She looked up at him for a moment , coloured deeply , and played something else . He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte , and turning to Emma , said , "" Here is something quite new to me . Do you know it?--Cramer.--"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma wished he would be less pointed , yet could not help being amused ; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile , when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness , there had been a smile of secret delight , she had less scruple in the amusement , and much less compunction with respect to her.--This amiable , upright , perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings ."
Emma Woodhouse	"He brought all the music to her , and they looked it over together.-- Emma took the opportunity of whispering , "" You speak too plain ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning . "" "" But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am very glad you did , and that you communicated it to me . I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" She is not entirely without it , I think ."
Emma Woodhouse	"The listeners were amused ; and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning . But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism . "" So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage , "" resumed Miss Bates . He cut her short with , "" I am going to Kingston . Can I do any thing for you ?"
Emma Woodhouse	yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr. Knightley spoke loud .
Emma Woodhouse	You must have heard every thing to be sure .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma found it really time to be at home ; the visit had already lasted long ; and on examining watches , so much of the morning was perceived to be gone , that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also , could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates , before they set off for Randalls .
Emma Woodhouse	With all the eagerness which such a transition gives , Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible .
Emma Woodhouse	Never had the exquisite sight , smell , sensation of nature , tranquil , warm , and brilliant after a storm , been more attractive to her .
Emma Woodhouse	She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on Mr. Perry 's coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery.--There
Emma Woodhouse	, with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her.--It was the first intimation of his being returned from London .
Emma Woodhouse	She had been thinking of him the moment before , as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.--There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind .
Emma Woodhouse	She must be collected and calm .
Emma Woodhouse	She asked after their mutual friends ; they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only that morning .
Emma Woodhouse	He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with her , she found .
Emma Woodhouse	""" He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors . ""--She thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully ; and the first possible cause for it , suggested by her fears , was , that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother , and was pained by the manner in which they had been received ."
Emma Woodhouse	She thought he was often looking at her , and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give . And this belief produced another dread .
Emma Woodhouse	Perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to Harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject .
Emma Woodhouse	Yet she could not bear this silence .
Emma Woodhouse	"She considered -- resolved -- and , trying to smile , began-- "" You have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you . "" "" Have I ? "" said he quietly , and looking at her ; "" of what nature ? "" "" Oh ! the best nature in the world -- a wedding . """
Emma Woodhouse	"After waiting a moment , as if to be sure she intended to say no more , he replied , "" If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" How is it possible ? "" cried Emma , turning her glowing cheeks towards him ; for , while she spoke , it occurred to her that he might have called at Mrs. Goddard 's in his way ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma was quite relieved , and could presently say , with a little more composure , "" _ You _ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it -- but--(with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness . """
Emma Woodhouse	"For a moment or two nothing was said , and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest , till she found her arm drawn within his , and pressed against his heart , and heard him thus saying , in a tone of great sensibility , speaking low , "" Time , my dearest Emma , time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your father 's sake -- I know you will not allow yourself-- . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Her arm was pressed again , as he added , in a more broken and subdued accent , "" The feelings of the warmest friendship -- Indignation -- Abominable scoundrel!""-- And in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded with , "" He will soon be gone ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied , "" You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right.-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Emma ! "" cried he , looking eagerly at her , "" are you , indeed?""-- but checking himself--""No , no , I understand you -- forgive me -- I am pleased that you can say even so much.--He"
Emma Woodhouse	and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!--I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt-- I could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?-- Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Mr. Knightley , "" said Emma , trying to be lively , but really confused-- "" I am in a very extraordinary situation ."
Emma Woodhouse	I can not let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.-- But I never have .
Emma Woodhouse	He listened in perfect silence . She wished him to speak , but he
Emma Woodhouse	She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion .
Emma Woodhouse	She went on , however .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased.-- An old story , probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding ."
Emma Woodhouse	He was the son of Mr. Weston -- he was continually here -- I always found him very pleasant -- and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered , and I allowed his attentions .
Emma Woodhouse	Latterly , however -- for some time , indeed-- I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I
Emma Woodhouse	thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side .
Emma Woodhouse	He has imposed on me , but he has not injured me .
Emma Woodhouse	I have never been
Emma Woodhouse	And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour .
Emma Woodhouse	"It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another.--It was his object to blind all about him ; and no one , I am sure , could be more effectually blinded than myself -- except that I was _ not _ blinded -- that it was my good fortune -- that , in short , I was somehow or other safe from him . """
Emma Woodhouse	She had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought .
Emma Woodhouse	"My acquaintance with him has been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has a chance.--I have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well . "" "" I have no doubt of their being happy together , "" said Emma ; "" I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" You speak as if you envied him . "" "" And I do envy him , Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	"In one respect he is the object of my envy . "" Emma could say no more ."
Emma Woodhouse	"They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet , and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject , if possible . She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr. Knightley startled her , by saying , "" You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity.--You are wise -- but _ I _ can not be wise ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma , I must tell you what you will not ask , though I may wish it unsaid the next moment .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! then , do n't speak it , do n't speak it , "" she eagerly cried . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Thank you , "" said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma could not bear to give him pain .
Emma Woodhouse	He was wishing to confide in her-- perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would , she would listen .
Emma Woodhouse	She might assist his resolution , or reconcile him to it ; she might give just praise to Harriet , or , by representing to him his own independence , relieve him from that state of indecision , which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.--They
Emma Woodhouse	""" You are going in , I suppose ? "" said he ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" No,""--replied Emma -- quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke--""I should like to take another turn ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Perry is not gone . "" And , after proceeding a few steps , she added-- "" I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr. Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me.--I will"
Emma Woodhouse	hear whatever you like .
Emma Woodhouse	I will tell you exactly what I think .
Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	""" As a friend!""--repeated Mr. Knightley.--""Emma , that I fear is a word -- No , I have no wish -- Stay , yes , why should I hesitate?-- I have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma , I accept your offer-- Extraordinary as it may seem , I accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend.--Tell me , then , have I no chance of ever succeeding ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dearest Emma , "" said he , "" for dearest you will always be , whatever the event of this hour 's conversation , my dearest , most beloved Emma -- tell me at once ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Say ` No , ' if it is to be said . ""-- She could really say nothing.--""You are silent , "" he cried , with great animation ; "" absolutely silent !"
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment .
Emma Woodhouse	"I can not make speeches , Emma : "" he soon resumed ; and in a tone of such sincere , decided , intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing.--""If I loved you less , I might be able to talk about it more ."
Emma Woodhouse	But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them .
Emma Woodhouse	, you see , you understand my feelings-- and will return them if you can .
Emma Woodhouse	At present , I ask only to hear , once to hear your voice .
Emma Woodhouse	""" While he spoke , Emma 's mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word-- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet 's hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet 's secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not.--It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two-- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not . She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain ."
Emma Woodhouse	She had led her friend astray , and it would be a reproach to her for ever ; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings , and as strong as it had ever been before , in reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal and degrading .
Emma Woodhouse	Her way was clear , though not quite smooth.--She spoke then , on being so entreated.-- What did she say?--Just what she ought , of course .
Emma Woodhouse	A lady always does.-- She said enough to shew there need not be despair -- and to invite him to say more himself .
Emma Woodhouse	He _ had _ despaired at one period ; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence , as for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn , her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to , might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency ; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it , and seek no farther explanation .
Emma Woodhouse	Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material.-- Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his .
Emma Woodhouse	He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it .
Emma Woodhouse	He had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill 's engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings .
Emma Woodhouse	The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill , of her having a heart completely disengaged from him , had given birth to the hope , that , in time , he might gain her affection himself;--but it had been no present hope -- he had only , in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment , aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.-- The affection , which he had been asking to be allowed to create , if he could , was already his!--Within half an hour , he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind , to something so like perfect happiness , that it could bear no other name . _
Emma Woodhouse	one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or
Emma Woodhouse	, there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma , and jealous of Frank Churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other .
Emma Woodhouse	There was too much domestic happiness in his brother 's house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; Isabella was too much like Emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer.--He had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning 's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer . He had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery .
Emma Woodhouse	He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him . Frank Churchill 's character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma had hardly expected them : for Mr. Weston , who had called in for half a minute , in order to hear that his son was very handsome , knew nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking up to the house together , arm in arm
Emma Woodhouse	She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs. Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend .
Emma Woodhouse	But on seeing them together , she became perfectly satisfied .
Emma Woodhouse	It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty ; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection .
Emma Woodhouse	And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning . They were all three walking about together for an hour or two-- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield , and afterwards in Highbury . He was delighted with every thing ; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse 's ear ; and when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village , and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma watched and decided , that with such feelings as were now shewn , it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been acting a part , or making a parade of insincere professions ; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him justice .
Emma Woodhouse	He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing ; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills .
Emma Woodhouse	"At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown ; and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged , Emma recollected his intended visit the day before , and asked him if he had paid it . "" Yes , oh ! yes""--he replied ; "" I was just going to mention it ."
Emma Woodhouse	very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me .
Emma Woodhouse	""" And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ? "" "" Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs. Weston , is it ?"
Emma Woodhouse	Emma would not agree to this , and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax 's complexion .
Emma Woodhouse	"Where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was . "" Well , "" said Emma , "" there is no disputing about taste.--At least you admire her except her complexion ."
Emma Woodhouse	If it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that I may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of Highbury . I must buy something at Ford 's .
Emma Woodhouse	I do admire your patriotism .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I merely asked , whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth . "" "" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a"
Emma Woodhouse	"I like them all . "" "" You know Miss Fairfax 's situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ? "" "" Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do . "" "" You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , "" said Mrs. Weston smiling ; "" remember that I am here.--Mr . Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax 's situation in life ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I will move a little farther off . "" "" I certainly do forget to think of _ her _ , "" said Emma , "" as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend . """
Emma Woodhouse	"He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment . When the gloves were bought , and they had quitted the shop again , "" Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ? "" said Frank Churchill ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ever hear her ! "" repeated Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" You forget how much she belongs to Highbury ."
Emma Woodhouse	I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began . She plays charmingly .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" You think so , do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Proof indeed ! "" said Emma , highly amused.--""Mr . Dixon is very musical , is he ?"
Emma Woodhouse	"We shall know more about them all , in half an hour , from you , than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year . "" "" Yes , Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof . "" "" Certainly -- very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _ I _ had been Miss Campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me ."
Emma Woodhouse	I could not excuse a man 's having more music than love -- more ear than eye -- a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" It was her very particular friend , you know ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Poor comfort ! "" said Emma , laughing ."
Emma Woodhouse	Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland .
Emma Woodhouse	""" You are right ."
Emma Woodhouse	"It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell ; but she really did not seem to feel it . "" "" So much the better -- or so much the worse:--I do not know which ."
Emma Woodhouse	But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling -- there was one person , I think , who must have felt it : Miss Fairfax herself .
Emma Woodhouse	"She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction . "" "" As to that -- I do not-- "" "" Oh ! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax 's sensations from you , or from any body else . They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal . "" He perfectly agreed with her : and after walking together so long , and thinking so much alike , Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him , that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting . He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected ."
Emma Woodhouse	She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr. Elton 's house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with .
Emma Woodhouse	But Emma , in her own mind , determined that he _ did _ know what he was talking about , and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life , and to marry , from worthy motives .
Emma Woodhouse	Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in Highbury !
Emma Woodhouse	"You were very popular before you came , because you were Mr. Weston 's son -- but lay out half a guinea at Ford 's , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues . "" They went in ; and while the sleek , well - tied parcels of "" Men 's Beavers "" and "" York Tan "" were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said--""But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _ amor _ _ patriae _ ."
Emma Woodhouse	Do not let me lose it . I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I merely asked , whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth . "" "" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon my word !"
Emma Woodhouse	But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her .
Emma Woodhouse	"I like them all . "" "" You know Miss Fairfax 's situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ? "" "" Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do . "" "" You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , "" said Mrs. Weston smiling ; "" remember that I am here.--Mr . Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax 's situation in life ."
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all . Emma had feelings , less of curiosity than of pride or propriety , to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects ; and she made a point of Harriet 's going with her , that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible . She could not enter the house again , could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to lace up her boot , without _ recollecting _ .
Emma Woodhouse	"The visit was of course short ; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it , that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady , and on no account to give one , beyond the nothing - meaning terms of being "" elegantly dressed , and very pleasing . """
Emma Woodhouse	She did not really like her .
Emma Woodhouse	She would not be in a hurry to find fault , but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease , but not elegance.-- She was almost sure that for a young woman , a stranger , a bride , there was too much ease . Her person was rather good ; her face not unpretty ; but neither feature , nor air , nor voice , nor manner , were elegant . Emma thought at least it would turn out so .
Emma Woodhouse	As for Mr. Elton , his manners did not appear -- but no , she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners .
Emma Woodhouse	"The woman was better off ; she might have the assistance of fine clothes , and the privilege of bashfulness , but the man had only his own good sense to depend on ; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married , the woman he had wanted to marry , and the woman whom he had been expected to marry , she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise , and to be as much affectedly , and as little really easy as could be . "" Well , Miss Woodhouse , "" said Harriet , when they had quitted the house , and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ;"
Emma Woodhouse	""" There was a little hesitation in Emma 's answer ."
Emma Woodhouse	"He called her ` Augusta . ' How delightful ! "" When the visit was returned , Emma made up her mind . She could then see more and judge better ."
Emma Woodhouse	From Harriet 's happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father 's being present to engage Mr. Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady 's conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good . Harriet would have been a better match .
Emma Woodhouse	If not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma made as slight a reply as she could ; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs. Elton , who only wanted to be talking herself .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment .
Emma Woodhouse	"She had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else ; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double - dyed , and therefore only said in reply , "" When you have seen more of this country , I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield ."
Emma Woodhouse	yes , I am quite aware of that .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was silenced .
Emma Woodhouse	"I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good . "" "" My father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr. Perry , whose name , I dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now . "" "" Ah !"
Emma Woodhouse	"A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , Mrs. Partridge , the lady I have always resided with when in Bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with . "" It was as much as Emma could bear , without being impolite ."
Emma Woodhouse	The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an _ introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs. Elton's -- probably some vulgar , dashing widow , who , with the help of a boarder , just made a shift to live!-- The dignity of Miss Woodhouse , of Hartfield , was sunk indeed !
Emma Woodhouse	"She restrained herself , however , from any of the reproofs she could have given , and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly ; "" but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" We can not suppose , "" said Emma , smiling , "" that Mr. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _ very _ musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright . I used to be quite angry with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention . I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper . "" "" But every thing of that kind , "" said Emma , "" will soon be in so regular a train-- "" "" Well , "" said Mrs. Elton , laughing , "" we shall see . """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma , finding her so determined upon neglecting her music , had nothing more to say ; and , after a moment 's pause , Mrs. Elton chose another subject .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature-- quite a first - rate favourite with me already , I assure you .
Emma Woodhouse	"She was your governess , I think ? """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was almost too much astonished to answer ; but Mrs. Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mrs. Weston 's manners , "" said Emma , "" were always particularly good ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman . "" "" And who do you think came in while we were there ? "" Emma was quite at a loss . The tone implied some old acquaintance-- and how could she possibly guess ? "" Knightley ! "" continued Mrs. Elton ; "" Knightley himself!--Was not it lucky?--for , not being within when he called the other day , I had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr. E. 's , I had a great curiosity ."
Emma Woodhouse	They were off ; and Emma could breathe .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Insufferable woman ! "" was her immediate exclamation ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind!""-- All this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the Eltons ' departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , my dear , "" he deliberately began , "" considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , my dear , I never encouraged any body to marry , but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady -- and a bride , especially , is never to be neglected ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dear , you do not understand me ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma had done ."
Emma Woodhouse	Her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _ her _ . Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton 's offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her .
Emma Woodhouse	This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure .
Emma Woodhouse	It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying . The impertinence of the Eltons , which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening , had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of Harriet 's infatuation.-- From Harriet 's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she had strong hopes .
Emma Woodhouse	It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him .
Emma Woodhouse	The fever was over , and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy .
Emma Woodhouse	She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational , Frank Churchill not too much in love , and Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her , how very happy a summer must be before her !
Emma Woodhouse	She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning . He had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield , as he was to be at home by the middle of the day .
Emma Woodhouse	She did not regret it .
Emma Woodhouse	Having arranged all these matters , looked them through , and put them all to rights , she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys , as well as of their grandpapa , when the great iron sweep - gate opened , and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together -- Frank Churchill , with Harriet leaning on his arm -- actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened .
Emma Woodhouse	A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole .
Emma Woodhouse	She had suffered very much from cramp after dancing , and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless-- and in this state , and exceedingly terrified , she had been obliged to remain .
Emma Woodhouse	This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and of Harriet 's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.-- He dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself .
Emma Woodhouse	So Emma thought , at least . Could a linguist , could a grammarian , could even a mathematician have seen what she did , have witnessed their appearance together , and heard their history of it , without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?--How much more must an imaginist , like herself , be on fire with speculation and foresight!--especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made .
Emma Woodhouse	Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--And knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more .
Emma Woodhouse	He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself , she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton .
Emma Woodhouse	In the few minutes ' conversation which she had yet had with him , while Harriet had been partially insensible , he had spoken of her terror , her naivete , her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm , with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at last , after Harriet 's own account had been given , he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms .
Emma Woodhouse	She would not stir a step , nor drop a hint .
Emma Woodhouse	No , she had had enough of interference .
Emma Woodhouse	Beyond it she would on no account proceed .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma 's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion : but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible .
Emma Woodhouse	Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again . It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ) , as well as Miss Smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent-- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and Harriet not much otherwise , Emma would not interfere with .
Emma Woodhouse	She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man , for she hardly knew what indisposition was ; and if he did not invent illnesses for her , she could make no figure in a message .
Emma Woodhouse	The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry . The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began , and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground , and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do not know what your opinion may be , Mrs. Weston , "" said Mr. Knightley , "" of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith , but I think it a bad thing ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good . I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good !
Emma Woodhouse	This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma , Mr. Knightley .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle . "" "" Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject . We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with . Mr. Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith . She is not the superior young woman which Emma 's friend ought to be . But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old ."
Emma Woodhouse	I have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule . The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now . But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	"She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding . Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate , I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not . "" """
Emma Woodhouse	"I dare say , "" replied Mrs. Weston , smiling , "" that I thought so _ then_;--but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma 's omitting to do any thing I wished ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family . At ten years old , she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen .
Emma Woodhouse	She was always quick and assured : Isabella slow and diffident . And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all . In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her .
Emma Woodhouse	She inherits her mother 's talents , and must have been under subjection to her .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I should have been sorry , Mr. Knightley , to be dependent on _ your _ recommendation , had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse 's family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body . I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held . "" "" Yes , "" said he , smiling . "" You are better placed _ here _ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess . But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield ."
Emma Woodhouse	You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise ; but you were receiving a very good education from _ her _ , on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will , and doing as you were bid ; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife , I should certainly have named Miss Taylor .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Thank you . There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr. Weston . "" "" Why , to own the truth , I am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I hope not _ that_.--It is not likely . No , Mr. Knightley , do not foretell vexation from that quarter . "" """
Emma Woodhouse	I do not pretend to Emma 's genius for foretelling and guessing .
Emma Woodhouse	I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have .
Emma Woodhouse	She knows nothing herself , and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing .
Emma Woodhouse	How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ?
Emma Woodhouse	I am much mistaken if Emma 's doctrines give any strength of mind , or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.--They only give a little polish .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I either depend more upon Emma 's good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I can not lament the acquaintance ."
Emma Woodhouse	How well she looked last night !
Emma Woodhouse	you would rather talk of her person than her mind , would you ?
Emma Woodhouse	"Very well ; I shall not attempt to deny Emma 's being pretty . "" "" Pretty !"
Emma Woodhouse	Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether -- face and figure ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers ."
Emma Woodhouse	There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance .
Emma Woodhouse	One hears sometimes of a child being ` the picture of health ; ' now , Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown - up health .
Emma Woodhouse	She is loveliness itself .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Knightley , is not she ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I have not a fault to find with her person , "" he replied . """
Emma Woodhouse	I think her all you describe .
Emma Woodhouse	I love to look at her ; and I will add this praise , that I do not think her personally vain .
Emma Woodhouse	Considering how very handsome she is , she appears to be little occupied with it ; her vanity lies another way .
Emma Woodhouse	"With all dear Emma 's little faults , she is an excellent creature . Where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ? No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times . "" "" Very well ; I will not plague you any more ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma shall be an angel , and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella . John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma 's mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith 's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you ."
Emma Woodhouse	Pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it can not be expected that Emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself . It has been so many years my province to give advice , that you can not be surprized , Mr. Knightley , at this little remains of office .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister ."
Emma Woodhouse	I will keep my ill - humour to myself . I have a very sincere interest in Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	Isabella does not seem more my sister ; has never excited a greater interest ; perhaps hardly so great .
Emma Woodhouse	There is an anxiety , a curiosity in what one feels for Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	"I wonder what will become of her ! "" "" So do I , "" said Mrs. Weston gently , "" very much . "" "" She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all . But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for ."
Emma Woodhouse	It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object .
Emma Woodhouse	"I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good . But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home . "" "" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present , "" said Mrs. Weston , "" as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I can not wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse 's account ."
Emma Woodhouse	I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma , though I mean no slight to the state
Emma Woodhouse	"There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma 's destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to "" What does Weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ? "" convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield ."
Emma Woodhouse	It was an alarming change ; and Emma was thinking of it one morning , as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her , when Mr. Knightley came in , and distressing thoughts were put by .
Emma Woodhouse	"After the first chat of pleasure he was silent ; and then , in a graver tone , began with , "" I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Good or bad ? "" said she , quickly , looking up in his face ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do not know which it ought to be called . "" "" Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance .
Emma Woodhouse	You are trying not to smile .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am afraid , "" said he , composing his features , "" I am very much afraid , my dear Emma , that you will not smile when you hear it . """
Emma Woodhouse	but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too .
Emma Woodhouse	He paused a moment , again smiling , with his eyes fixed on her face .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Does nothing occur to you?-- Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith . "" Her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Have you heard from her yourself this morning ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You have , I believe , and know the whole ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma gave a start , which did not seem like being prepared-- and her eyes , in eager gaze , said , "" No , this is impossible ! "" but her lips were closed ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is so , indeed , "" continued Mr. Knightley ; "" I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left me not half an hour ago . "" She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement . "" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were the same . But in time they will . Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" You mistake me , you quite mistake me , "" she replied , exerting herself ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I can not believe it ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Good God ! "" she cried.--""Well!""--Then"
Emma Woodhouse	"having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , "" Well , now tell me every thing ; make this intelligible to me ."
Emma Woodhouse	How , where , when?--Let me know it all .
Emma Woodhouse	I never was more surprized -- but it does not make me unhappy , I assure you.--How
Emma Woodhouse	"-- how has it been possible ? "" "" It is a very simple story ."
Emma Woodhouse	He went to town on business three days ago , and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John.--He delivered these papers to John , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley 's . They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley 's .
Emma Woodhouse	My friend Robert could not resist .
Emma Woodhouse	They called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as I understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain.--She
Emma Woodhouse	Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.-- She will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman 's language can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only in the great.--However
Emma Woodhouse	, I must say , that Robert Martin 's heart seemed for _ him _ , and to _ me _ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at Astley 's , my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John , and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy .
Emma Woodhouse	""" He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply ."
Emma Woodhouse	To speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness .
Emma Woodhouse	She must wait a moment , or he would think her mad .
Emma Woodhouse	"Her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added , "" Emma , my love , you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy ; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected ."
Emma Woodhouse	His situation is an evil -- but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend ; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more .
Emma Woodhouse	His good sense and good principles would delight you.--As far as the man is concerned , you could not wish your friend in better hands .
Emma Woodhouse	His rank in society I would alter if I could , which is saying a great deal I assure you , Emma.--You laugh at me about William Larkins ; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin .
Emma Woodhouse	""" He wanted her to look up and smile ; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly -- she did -- cheerfully answering , "" You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match ."
Emma Woodhouse	I think Harriet is doing extremely well .
Emma Woodhouse	In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are . I have been silent from surprize merely , excessive surprize .
Emma Woodhouse	You can not imagine how suddenly it has come on me !
Emma Woodhouse	how peculiarly unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before .
Emma Woodhouse	""" You ought to know your friend best , "" replied Mr. Knightley ; "" but I should say she was a good - tempered , soft - hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma could not help laughing as she answered , "" Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But , Mr. Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _ accepted _ him . I could suppose she might in time -- but can she already?-- Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him?--It was not Harriet 's hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox . "" The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was , at this moment , so strong to Emma 's feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet 's side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , "" No , I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin , "" that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am quite sure , "" he replied , speaking very distinctly , "" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am perfectly satisfied , "" replied Emma , with the brightest smiles , "" and most sincerely wish them happy ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before . "" "" I hope so -- for at that time I was a fool . "" "" And I am changed also ; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet 's good qualities ."
Emma Woodhouse	I have taken some pains for your sake , and for Robert Martin 's sake , ( whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever , ) to get acquainted with her .
Emma Woodhouse	You must have seen that I did .
Emma Woodhouse	Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin 's cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.-- Much of this , I have no doubt , she may thank you for .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Me ! "" cried Emma , shaking her head.--""Ah ! poor Harriet ! "" She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved ."
Emma Woodhouse	Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father .
Emma Woodhouse	She was not sorry .
Emma Woodhouse	She wanted to be alone .
Emma Woodhouse	Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected .
Emma Woodhouse	She was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and till she had moved about , and talked to herself , and laughed and reflected , she could be fit for nothing rational .
Emma Woodhouse	Her father 's business was to announce James 's being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing .
Emma Woodhouse	The joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined . The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet 's welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.--What had she to wish for ?
Emma Woodhouse	Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own .
Emma Woodhouse	Nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future .
Emma Woodhouse	Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them .
Emma Woodhouse	She must laugh at such a close !
Emma Woodhouse	Now there would be pleasure in her returning --
Emma Woodhouse	High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would soon be over .
Emma Woodhouse	The disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to her to practise , might soon be over .
Emma Woodhouse	She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty .
Emma Woodhouse	In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day , or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed .
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is Frank and Miss Fairfax , "" said Mrs. Weston ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning ."
Emma Woodhouse	"are coming in , I hope . """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- a number of embarrassing recollections on each side .
Emma Woodhouse	They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure .
Emma Woodhouse	"When Mr. Weston joined the party , however , and when the baby was fetched , there was no longer a want of subject or animation-- or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say , "" I have to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs. Weston 's letters . I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon . I hope you do not retract what you then said ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" No , indeed , "" cried Emma , most happy to begin , "" not in the least ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you -- and to give you joy in person . "" He thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston doat upon her ."
Emma Woodhouse	"But his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells , he named the name of Dixon.--Emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I can never think of it , "" she cried , "" without extreme shame ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" The shame , "" he answered , "" is all mine , or ought to be . But is it possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Early , I know , you had none . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I never had the smallest , I assure you . "" "" That appears quite wonderful ."
Emma Woodhouse	I was once very near -- and I wish I had-- it would have been better .
Emma Woodhouse	But though I was always doing wrong things , they were very bad wrong things , and such as did me no service.-- It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing .
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is not now worth a regret , "" said Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have some hope , "" resumed he , "" of my uncle 's being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her . When the Campbells are returned , we shall meet them in London , and continue there , I trust , till we may carry her northward.--But now , I am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard , Miss Woodhouse?-- Till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation . Do not you pity me ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried , "" Ah ! by the bye , "" then sinking his voice , and looking demure for the moment--""I hope Mr. Knightley is well ? "" He paused.--She coloured and laughed.--""I know you saw my letter , and think you may remember my wish in your favour . Let me return your congratulations.-- I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He is a man whom I can not presume to praise . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma was delighted , and only wanted him to go on in the same style ; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane , and his next words were , "" Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness ! such delicacy!-- and yet without being actually"
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have always admired her complexion , "" replied Emma , archly ; "" but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?-- When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! no -- what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare-- "" But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that Emma could not help saying , "" I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time , you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.-- I am sure it was a consolation to you . "" "" Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	no , no , no -- how can you suspect me of such a thing ?
Emma Woodhouse	"I was the most miserable wretch ! "" "" Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth ."
Emma Woodhouse	I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation .
Emma Woodhouse	"I think there is a little likeness between us . "" He bowed ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" If not in our dispositions , "" she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , "" there is a likeness in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , not true on your side ."
Emma Woodhouse	You can have no superior , but most true on mine.--She
Emma Woodhouse	Observe her eyes , as she is looking up at my father.-- You will be glad to hear ( inclining his head , and whispering seriously ) that my uncle means to give her all my aunt 's jewels .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Very beautiful , indeed , "" replied Emma ; and she spoke so kindly , that he gratefully burst out , "" How delighted I am to see you again ! and to see you in such excellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I should certainly have called at Hartfield , had you failed to come . "" The others had been talking of the child , Mrs. Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant 's appearing not quite well ."
Emma Woodhouse	She believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr. Perry .
Emma Woodhouse	Perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes
Emma Woodhouse	, however , the child had been perfectly well again . This was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it .
Emma Woodhouse	""" She should always send for Perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment ."
Emma Woodhouse	She could not be too soon alarmed , nor send for Perry too often .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Perry ! "" said he to Emma , and trying , as he spoke , to catch Miss Fairfax 's eye . "" My friend Mr. Perry !"
Emma Woodhouse	"What are they saying about Mr. Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel now?--Has he set up his carriage ? "" Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from Jane 's countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I can never think of it without laughing.--She hears us , she hears us , Miss Woodhouse ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye-- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice , "" How you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me!-- They _ will _ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them ! """
Emma Woodhouse	He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma 's feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley 's high superiority of character .
Emma Woodhouse	That there was to be such a party had been long generally known : it had even given the idea of another . Emma had never been to Box Hill ; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing , and she and Mr. Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither .
Emma Woodhouse	This was so very well understood between them , that Emma could not but feel some surprise , and a little displeasure , on hearing from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton , as her brother and sister had failed her , that the two parties should unite , and go together ; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it , so it was to be , if she had no objection .
Emma Woodhouse	Now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton , of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton 's party !
Emma Woodhouse	"Every feeling was offended ; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston 's temper . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I am glad you approve of what I have done , "" said he very comfortably ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" But I thought you would . Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers . One can not have too large a party ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma denied none of it aloud , and agreed to none of it in private ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" You had better explore to Donwell , "" replied Mr. Knightley . "" That may be done without horses ."
Emma Woodhouse	Only give me a carte - blanche.--I am Lady Patroness , you know .
Emma Woodhouse	Well , I shall bring Jane with me-- Jane and her aunt.--The rest I leave to you .
Emma Woodhouse	""" You will not find either , between Donwell and Highbury ."
Emma Woodhouse	You can borrow Mrs. Cole 's .
Emma Woodhouse	He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse , as well as Emma , to join the party ; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens ."
Emma Woodhouse	He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton , and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma 's , and Harriet 's going there some very fine morning .
Emma Woodhouse	The invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like Mrs. Elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and Mr. Weston , unasked , promised to get Frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--
Emma Woodhouse	It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey , that as soon as she was satisfied of her father 's comfort , she was glad to leave him , and look around her ; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation , more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family . She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered-- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the Abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and Emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had ; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably .
Emma Woodhouse	"She had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush . These were pleasant feelings , and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did , and collect round the strawberry - beds.--The whole party were assembled , excepting Frank Churchill , who was expected every moment from Richmond ; and Mrs. Elton , in all her apparatus of happiness , her large bonnet and her basket , was very ready to lead the way in gathering , accepting , or talking -- strawberries , and only strawberries , could now be thought or spoken of.--""The best fruit in England-- every body 's favourite -- always wholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one 's self -- the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time -- never tired-- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison-- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce --"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy.-- She had some fears of his horse . Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.-- A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question ."
Emma Woodhouse	Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend 's negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.-- Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow 's post.--How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma.--She
Emma Woodhouse	"Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens-- all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent . ""--The pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear ."
Emma Woodhouse	In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete - a - tete ; but she was glad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion , and turned from her with little ceremony .
Emma Woodhouse	Now they seemed in pleasant conversation . There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm ; but now she feared it not .
Emma Woodhouse	It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty , its rich pastures , spreading flocks , orchard in blossom , and light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the wall , and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around .
Emma Woodhouse	"He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture , etc . and Emma received a smile which seemed to say , "" These are my own concerns ."
Emma Woodhouse	I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin .
Emma Woodhouse	"""--She did not suspect him ."
Emma Woodhouse	shade was most refreshing , and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration ; she behaved very well , and betrayed no emotion . The cold repast was over , and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen , the old Abbey fish - ponds ; perhaps get as far as the clover , which was to be begun cutting on the morrow , or , at any rate , have the pleasure of being hot , and growing cool again.--Mr
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him , and now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child , than in a total want of taste for what he saw , for he was slow , constant , and methodical.--Before this second looking over was begun
Emma Woodhouse	, however , Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments ' free observation of the entrance and ground - plot of the house -- and was hardly there , when Jane Fairfax appeared , coming quickly in from the garden , and with a look of escape.-- Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon , there was a start at first ; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Will you be so kind , "" said she , "" when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home?--I am going this moment.--My"
Emma Woodhouse	Till they all come in I shall not be missed ; and when they do , will you have the goodness to say that I am gone ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Certainly , if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone ? "" "" Yes -- what should hurt me?--I walk fast ."
Emma Woodhouse	Let my father 's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Thank you , thank you -- but on no account.--I would rather walk.-- And for _ me _ to be afraid of walking alone!--I , who may so soon have to guard others ! "" She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , "" That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now ."
Emma Woodhouse	I must order the carriage .
Emma Woodhouse	"I am,""--she answered--""I am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits ."
Emma Woodhouse	"The greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that I am gone when it is necessary . "" Emma had not another word to oppose ."
Emma Woodhouse	She saw it all ; and entering into her feelings , promoted her quitting the house immediately ,
Emma Woodhouse	"Her parting look was grateful -- and her parting words , "" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone!""--seemed to burst from an overcharged heart , and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her , even towards some of those who loved her best ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Such a home , indeed !"
Emma Woodhouse	"such an aunt ! "" said Emma , as she turned back into the hall again ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do pity you ."
Emma Woodhouse	"And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more I shall like you . "" Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St. Mark 's Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him .
Emma Woodhouse	""" As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again . I could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming !"
Emma Woodhouse	You will all be going soon I suppose ; the whole party breaking up .
Emma Woodhouse	"I met _ one _ as I came -- Madness in such weather!--absolute madness ! """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma listened , and looked , and soon perceived that Frank Churchill 's state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour . Some people were always cross when they were hot .
Emma Woodhouse	Such might be his constitution ; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room -- and she humanely pointed out the door .
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma returned all her attention to her father , saying in secret-- "" I am glad I have done being in love with him . I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning ."
Emma Woodhouse	You will have my sketches , some time or other , to look at -- or my tour to read -- or my poem . I shall do something to expose myself .
Emma Woodhouse	I assure you I have .
Emma Woodhouse	"I can never bear to think of you all there without me . "" "" These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Frank Churchill 's little inclination to exclude himself increased so much , that his last words to Emma were , "" Well;--if _ you _ wish me to stay and join the party , I will . """
Emma Woodhouse	She smiled her acceptance ; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to take him back before the following evening .
Emma Woodhouse	Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend 's negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.-- Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow 's post.--How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma.--She
Emma Woodhouse	"Her parting look was grateful -- and her parting words , "" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone!""--seemed to burst from an overcharged heart , and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her , even towards some of those who loved her best ."
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill , was willing to forget his late improprieties , and be as well satisfied with him as before , and on his making Harriet his very first subject , was ready to listen with most friendly smiles .
Emma Woodhouse	"He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend-- her fair , lovely , amiable friend . "" Did she know?--had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably . "" And in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and Emma was quite in charity with him ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I am sure of your kind support and aid . "" Emma saw Mrs. Weston 's surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose ."
Emma Woodhouse	"She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention . She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse : "" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir ."
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son - in - law , who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly .
Emma Woodhouse	"He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house . "" What is to be done , my dear Emma?--what is to be done ? "" was Mr. Woodhouse 's first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time ."
Emma Woodhouse	To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little .
Emma Woodhouse	The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them .
Emma Woodhouse	""" You had better order the carriage directly , my love , "" said she ; "" I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk ."
Emma Woodhouse	I am not at all afraid .
Emma Woodhouse	I should not mind walking half the way .
Emma Woodhouse	I could change my shoes , you know , the moment I got home ; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold .
Emma Woodhouse	Isabella then went to Emma ; but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away ; and they were still discussing the point , when Mr. Knightley , who had left the room immediately after his brother 's first report of the snow ,
Emma Woodhouse	To Isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father 's account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls .
Emma Woodhouse	"He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus-- "" Your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am ready , if the others are . "" "" Shall I ring the bell ? "" "" Yes , do . """
Emma Woodhouse	"minutes more , and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over . The carriage came : and Mr. Woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for . """
Emma Woodhouse	Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tete - a - tete drive .
Emma Woodhouse	It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have
Emma Woodhouse	But now , she would rather it had not happened .
Emma Woodhouse	She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston 's good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense .
Emma Woodhouse	To restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up -- her hand seized -- her attention demanded , and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping -- fearing -- adoring -- ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon
Emma Woodhouse	Without scruple -- without apology-- without much apparent diffidence , Mr. Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _ her _ lover . She tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all .
Emma Woodhouse	Angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak .
Emma Woodhouse	She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness , and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour .
Emma Woodhouse	"Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied , "" I am very much astonished , Mr. Elton ."
Emma Woodhouse	This to _ me _ !
Emma Woodhouse	"you forget yourself-- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _ me _ , if you please . """
Emma Woodhouse	"And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness , "" Mr. Elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct !"
Emma Woodhouse	and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner .
Emma Woodhouse	"Command yourself enough to say no more , and I will endeavour to forget it . """
Emma Woodhouse	He perfectly knew his own meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,-- but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,--he resumed the subject of his own passion , and was very urgent for a favourable answer .
Emma Woodhouse	"As she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied , "" It is impossible for me to doubt any longer ."
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Elton , my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express .
Emma Woodhouse	After such behaviour , as I have witnessed during the last month , to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible !
Emma Woodhouse	Believe me , sir , I am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions .
Emma Woodhouse	If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed!--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse ! who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near !
Emma Woodhouse	""" It would be impossible to say what Emma felt , on hearing this-- which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost ."
Emma Woodhouse	"She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton 's sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed-- "" Charming Miss Woodhouse ! allow me to interpret this interesting silence . It confesses that you have long understood me . "" "" No , sir , "" cried Emma , "" it confesses no such thing ."
Emma Woodhouse	So far from having long understood you , I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views , till this moment .
Emma Woodhouse	As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings-- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared , ) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent .
Emma Woodhouse	Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought seriously of her ?
Emma Woodhouse	"I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!-- No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received-- "" "" Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it . I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend ."
Emma Woodhouse	"But , as it is , the disappointment is single , and , I trust , will not be lasting . I have no thoughts of matrimony at present . "" He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace . If there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment . Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma"
Emma Woodhouse	then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night .
Emma Woodhouse	The compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield .
Emma Woodhouse	There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of-- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr. John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her , but Emma could not quarrel with herself .
Emma Woodhouse	He was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven .
Emma Woodhouse	She was sorry , but could not repent .
Emma Woodhouse	On the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin 's being no otherwise remembered , than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton , of the utmost advantage to the latter . Her views of improving her little friend 's mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to - morrow .
Emma Woodhouse	It was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet 's fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot - pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma assisted with her invention , memory and taste ; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand , it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order , in form as well as quantity .
Emma Woodhouse	He called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , Emma was immediately convinced must be his own .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Being my friend 's , I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye , but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it ."
Emma Woodhouse	The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet , which Emma could understand .
Emma Woodhouse	"He was gone the next moment:--after another moment 's pause , "" Take it , "" said Emma , smiling , and pushing the paper towards Harriet--""it is for you . Take your own ."
Emma Woodhouse	But Harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and Emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself .
Emma Woodhouse	This is feeling your way .
Emma Woodhouse	This is saying very plainly--`Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma spoke for her .
Emma Woodhouse	""" There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment , "" said she , "" that I can not have a doubt as to Mr. Elton 's intentions ."
Emma Woodhouse	I thought it must be so .
Emma Woodhouse	I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you .
Emma Woodhouse	Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened .
Emma Woodhouse	I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural .
Emma Woodhouse	I am very happy .
Emma Woodhouse	I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart .
Emma Woodhouse	It will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to Hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin 's prose .
Emma Woodhouse	"Give me the book , I will write it down , and then there can be no possible reflection on you . "" Harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love . It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity . "" I shall never let that book go out of my own hands , "" said she . "" Very well , "" replied Emma ; "" a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better I shall be pleased ."
Emma Woodhouse	But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him .
Emma Woodhouse	He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him .
Emma Woodhouse	"but you , Emma . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma only nodded , and smiled.--After a little thinking , and a very tender sigh , he added , "" Ah !"
Emma Woodhouse	it is no difficulty to see who you take after !
Emma Woodhouse	Your dear mother was so clever at all those things !
Emma Woodhouse	But I can remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention ; I can only recollect the first stanza ; and there are several .
Emma Woodhouse	Kitty , a fair but frozen maid , Kindled a flame I yet deplore , The hood - wink'd boy I called to aid , Though of his near approach afraid , So fatal to my suit before . And that is all that I can recollect of it -- but it is very clever all the way through . But I think , my dear , you said you had got it .
Emma Woodhouse	Have you thought , my dear , where you shall put her -- and what room there will be for the children ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I do not know , my dear -- but it is so long since she was here!--not since last Easter , and then only for a few days.--Mr . John Knightley 's being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly taken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I do not know , my dear ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes , my dear , if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she is coming for only one week ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" It would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield . "" Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley 's claims on his brother , or any body 's claims on Isabella , except his own ."
Emma Woodhouse	"He sat musing a little while , and then said , "" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does . I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . She and the children might stay very well ."
Emma Woodhouse	Unwelcome as it was , Mr. Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter 's attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them .
Emma Woodhouse	I am sure she will be pleased with the children . We are very proud of the children , are not we , papa ?
Emma Woodhouse	I wonder which she will think the handsomest , Henry or John ?
Emma Woodhouse	"I think their father is too rough with them very often . "" "" He appears rough to you , "" said Emma , "" because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough . He wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father ."
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet turned away ; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma thanked him , but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account ; her father was sure of his rubber .
Emma Woodhouse	He re - urged -- she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it--
Emma Woodhouse	Your friend will not take it amiss I hope .
Emma Woodhouse	"He looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused ; said something about "" honour,""--glanced at Emma and at Harriet , and then seeing the book open on the table , took it up , and examined it very attentively ."
Emma Woodhouse	"With the view of passing off an awkward moment , Emma smilingly said , "" You must make my apologies to your friend ; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two . He may be sure of every woman 's approbation while he writes with such gallantry ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh . She ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet 's share .
Emma Woodhouse	XVII When the ladies returned to the drawing - room after dinner , Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;-- with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself .
Emma Woodhouse	""" In this style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room ; her vanity had then a change of object , and Emma heard her saying in the same half - whisper to Jane , "" Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest!--Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature he is;--I assure you I like him excessively . I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me ."
Emma Woodhouse	"John Knightley looked at him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and said , "" I could not have believed it even of _ him _ . "" Mr. Weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room . He gave her a letter , it was from Frank , and to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it . "" Read it , read it , "" said he , "" it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma . "" The two ladies looked over it together ; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time , in a voice a little subdued , but very audible to every body ."
Emma Woodhouse	Has Emma read it all ?
Emma Woodhouse	She was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy . Her congratulations were warm and open ; but Emma could not speak so fluently .
Emma Woodhouse	_ She _ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings , and trying to understand the degree of her agitation , which she rather thought was considerable .
Emma Woodhouse	They were the first entitled , after Mrs. Weston and Emma , to be made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour . She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell .
Emma Woodhouse	She was feeling too much ; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting , and the sort of pain it was creating .
Emma Woodhouse	They all seemed to remember the day , the hour , the party , the occasion -- to feel the same consciousness , the same regrets -- to be ready to return to the same good understanding ; and they were just growing again like themselves , ( Harriet , as Emma must suspect , as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy , ) when the carriage reappeared , and all was over . The style of the visit , and the shortness of it , were then felt to be decisive .
Emma Woodhouse	Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture it all , and feel how justly they might resent , how naturally Harriet must suffer .
Emma Woodhouse	""" This is too bad , "" cried Emma , as they turned away ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so disappointed . """
Emma Woodhouse	And she leaned back in the corner , to indulge her murmurs , or to reason them away ; probably a little of both-- such being the commonest process of a not ill - disposed mind .
Emma Woodhouse	Presently the carriage stopt ; she looked up ; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston , who were standing to speak to her .
Emma Woodhouse	"There was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for Mr. Weston immediately accosted her with , "" How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father-- glad to see him so well ."
Emma Woodhouse	To know that _ she _ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy .
Emma Woodhouse	The worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment 's thought , she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more .
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated . "" I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield , "" said he , at the conclusion . Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , well , I am ready;""--and turning again to Emma , "" but you must not be expecting such a _ very _ fine young man ; you have only had _ my _ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:""-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent , and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Think of me to - morrow , my dear Emma , about four o'clock , "" was Mrs. Weston 's parting injunction ; spoken with some anxiety , and meant only for her ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma 's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness ; every thing wore a different air ; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before . When she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to Harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there .
Emma Woodhouse	But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once , and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time .
Emma Woodhouse	The morning of the interesting day arrived , and Mrs. Weston 's faithful pupil did not forget either at ten , or eleven , or twelve o'clock , that she was to think of her at four .
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dear , dear anxious friend,""--said she , in mental soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , "" always overcareful for every body 's comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" ' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed . He was very much pleased with Randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to Highbury , Highbury itself , Hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one 's _ own _ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it . That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma 's brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a
Emma Woodhouse	""" You can not see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings , "" said Emma ; "" were you to guess her to be _ eighteen _ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _ she _ would be ready to quarrel with you for using"
Emma Woodhouse	Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance .
Emma Woodhouse	She must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable .
Emma Woodhouse	She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about .
Emma Woodhouse	His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening .
Emma Woodhouse	"His son , too well bred to hear the hint , rose immediately also , saying , "" As you are going farther on business , sir , I will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now . I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma , ) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax . I shall have no difficulty , I suppose , in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I believe , is not the proper name -- I should rather say Barnes , or Bates ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance , "" said Emma ; "" she is a very elegant young woman . "" He agreed to it , but with so quiet a "" Yes , "" as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before , "" said she , "" I think you will to - day ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me . "" "" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance , and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day , with full confidence in their comfort .
Emma Woodhouse	There was no resisting such news , no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston 's , confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife , fewer and quieter , but not less to the purpose .
Emma Woodhouse	To know that _ she _ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy .
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated . "" I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield , "" said he , at the conclusion . Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" We had better move on , Mr. Weston , "" said she , "" we are detaining the girls ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dear , dear anxious friend,""--said she , in mental soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , "" always overcareful for every body 's comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right . """
Emma Woodhouse	The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall .
Emma Woodhouse	""" ' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I am sure they will bring him soon . """
Emma Woodhouse	She opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr. Weston and his son .
Emma Woodhouse	They had been arrived only a few minutes , and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank 's being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure .
Emma Woodhouse	The Frank Churchill so long talked of , so high in interest , was actually before her -- he was presented to her , and she did not think too much had been said in his praise ; he was a _ very _ good looking young man ; height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father 's ; he looked quick and sensible .
Emma Woodhouse	She felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well - bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be .
Emma Woodhouse	She was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan , and travel earlier , later , and quicker , that he might gain half a day .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I told you yesterday , "" cried Mr. Weston with exultation , "" I told you all that he would be here before the time named ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" But when satisfied on all these points , and their acquaintance proportionably advanced , he contrived to find an opportunity , while their two fathers were engaged with each other , of introducing his mother - in - law , and speaking of her with so much handsome praise , so much warm admiration , so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father , and her very kind reception of himself , as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please-- and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her ."
Emma Woodhouse	He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter .
Emma Woodhouse	He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor 's merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse 's character , than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor 's .
Emma Woodhouse	And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person .
Emma Woodhouse	Her own father 's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind , the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion , was a most comfortable circumstance .
Emma Woodhouse	She blessed the favouring blindness .
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me . "" "" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . """
Emma Woodhouse	"I Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in Emma 's opinion , had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day . She could not think that Harriet 's solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive-- "" Mr. Elton is so good to the poor ! "" she found something else must be done ."
Emma Woodhouse	She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers .
Emma Woodhouse	There was always sufficient reason for such an attention ; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called on , and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her , as rather negligent in that respect , and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts . She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart , as to her deficiency -- but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time -- tiresome women-- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second - rate and third - rate of Highbury , who were calling on them for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them .
Emma Woodhouse	But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in -- observing , as she proposed it to Harriet , that , as well as she could calculate , they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax .
Emma Woodhouse	". Cole had just been there , just called in for ten minutes , and had been so good as to sit an hour with them , and _ she _ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much ; and , therefore , she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too . """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ' ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent Harriet 's being obliged to say a word . This she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury , and their card - parties .
Emma Woodhouse	yes -- Mr. Elton , I understand -- certainly as to dancing-- Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was-- Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of Jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , Jane is so very great a favourite there . Whenever she is with us , Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can .
Emma Woodhouse	And so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , ` I know you can not have heard from Jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ; ' and when I immediately said , ` But indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning , ' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized . ` Have you , upon your honour ? ' said she ; ` well , that is quite unexpected .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma 's politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest-- "" Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately ?"
Emma Woodhouse	I am extremely happy .
Emma Woodhouse	"I hope she is well ? "" "" Thank you ."
Emma Woodhouse	"You are so kind ! "" replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter.--""Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	I was sure it could not be far off ; but I had put my huswife upon it , you see , without being aware , and so it was quite hid , but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table .
Emma Woodhouse	I was reading it to Mrs. Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her-- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says;--but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see-- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half .
Emma Woodhouse	My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well .
Emma Woodhouse	She often says , when the letter is first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work'-- do n't you , ma'am?--And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her-- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word .
Emma Woodhouse	And , indeed , though my mother 's eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank God ! with the help of spectacles .
Emma Woodhouse	My mother 's are really very good indeed .
Emma Woodhouse	""" All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath ; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax 's handwriting ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" You are extremely kind , "" replied Miss Bates , highly gratified ; "" you who are such a judge , and write so beautifully yourself ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Ma'am , "" addressing her , "" do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane 's handwriting ? """
Emma Woodhouse	And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it .
Emma Woodhouse	"She was pondering , in the meanwhile , upon the possibility , without seeming very rude , of making her escape from Jane Fairfax 's letter , and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse , when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention . "" My mother 's deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all ."
Emma Woodhouse	By only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice .
Emma Woodhouse	But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me . Jane speaks so distinct !
Emma Woodhouse	"However , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother 's time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here . We never were so long without seeing her before , and as I was telling Mrs. Cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon ? "" "" Oh yes ; next week . "" "" Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Thank you ."
Emma Woodhouse	You are very kind .
Emma Woodhouse	I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury , as they can be to see her . Yes , Friday or Saturday ; she can not say which , because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days .
Emma Woodhouse	But they always do , you know .
Emma Woodhouse	"That is the reason of her writing out of rule , as we call it ; for , in the common course , we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday . "" "" Yes , so I imagined ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to - day . "" "" So obliging of you ! No , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon . My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months with us at least ."
Emma Woodhouse	Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you .
Emma Woodhouse	The case is , you see , that the Campbells are going to Ireland .
Emma Woodhouse	They had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last October , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , I was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , I declare I do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in Jane 's letter -- wrote in Mr. Dixon 's name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly ,
Emma Woodhouse	and they would give them the meeting in Dublin , and take them back to their country seat , Baly - craig , a beautiful place , I fancy .
Emma Woodhouse	Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from Mr. Dixon , I mean-- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter 's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon , for which I do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland ; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself .
Emma Woodhouse	He is a most amiable , charming young man , I believe .
Emma Woodhouse	"Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland , from his account of things . "" At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma 's brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr. Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery , "" You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time ."
Emma Woodhouse	Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs. Dixon , you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell .
Emma Woodhouse	But you see , every thing turns out for the best .
Emma Woodhouse	They want her ( Mr. and Mrs. Dixon ) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell ; quite depend upon it ; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _ joint _ invitation , Jane says , as you will hear presently ; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention . He is a most charming young man .
Emma Woodhouse	Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit-- ( I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we had the history of that day , I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon !
Emma Woodhouse	""" But , in spite of all her friends ' urgency , and her own wish of seeing Ireland , Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates ? """
Emma Woodhouse	I am concerned to hear of it .
Emma Woodhouse	I think they judge wisely . But Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Dixon , I understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with Miss Fairfax .
Emma Woodhouse	You are very obliging to say such things -- but certainly not .
Emma Woodhouse	so long ago as the 7th of November , ( as I am going to read to you , ) and has never been well since .
Emma Woodhouse	"Nobody could nurse her , as we should do . "" "" It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday , and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following-- as you will find from Jane 's letter ."
Emma Woodhouse	So sudden!--You may guess , dear Miss Woodhouse , what a flurry it has thrown me in !
Emma Woodhouse	If it was not for the drawback of her illness -- but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin , and looking very poorly .
Emma Woodhouse	I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me , as to that .
Emma Woodhouse	I always make a point of reading Jane 's letters through to myself first , before I read them aloud to my mother , you know , for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her .
Emma Woodhouse	Jane desired me to do it , so I always do : and so I began to - day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell , than I burst out , quite frightened , with ` Bless me !
Emma Woodhouse	poor Jane is ill!'-- which my mother , being on the watch , heard distinctly , and was sadly
Emma Woodhouse	However , when I read on , I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first ; and I make so light of it now to her , that she does not think much about it .
Emma Woodhouse	But I can not imagine how I could be so off my guard .
Emma Woodhouse	If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr. Perry . The expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know . He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .
Emma Woodhouse	Well , now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I am afraid we must be running away , "" said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise--""My father will be expecting us ."
Emma Woodhouse	I had no intention , I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes , when I first entered the house .
Emma Woodhouse	I merely called , because I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates ; but I have been so pleasantly detained !
Emma Woodhouse	Now , however , we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good morning .
Emma Woodhouse	""" And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded ."
Emma Woodhouse	She regained the street -- happy in this , that though much had been forced on her against her will , though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax 's letter , she had been able to escape the letter itself .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied the drawing - room floor ; and there , in the very moderate - sized apartment , which was every thing to them , the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed ; the quiet neat old lady , who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse , and her more active , talking daughter ,
Emma Woodhouse	"almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness , thanks for their visit , solicitude for their shoes , anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse 's health , cheerful communications about her mother 's , and sweet - cake from the beaufet--""Mrs"
Emma Woodhouse	". Cole had just been there , just called in for ten minutes , and had been so good as to sit an hour with them , and _ she _ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much ; and , therefore , she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too . """
Emma Woodhouse	She often says , when the letter is first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work'-- do n't you , ma'am?--And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her-- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word .
Emma Woodhouse	I am sure there is nobody 's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse 's .
Emma Woodhouse	"Ma'am , "" addressing her , "" do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane 's handwriting ? """
Emma Woodhouse	When the time proposed drew near , Mrs. Weston 's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression .
Emma Woodhouse	These feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while Mrs. Weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr. Frank Churchill 's not coming , except as a disappointment at Randalls . The acquaintance at present had no charm for her .
Emma Woodhouse	She wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston 's disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship .
Emma Woodhouse	She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more , ) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away .
Emma Woodhouse	She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt , of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry ; the pleasure of looking at somebody new ; the gala - day to Highbury entire , which the sight of him would have made ; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again , found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley ; and , to her great amusement , perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion , and making use of Mrs. Weston 's arguments against herself .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I can not believe that he has not the power of coming , if he made a point of it ."
Emma Woodhouse	It is too unlikely , for me to believe it without proof .
Emma Woodhouse	""" How odd you are !"
Emma Woodhouse	"What has Mr. Frank Churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ? "" "" I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions , and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure , from living with those who have always set him the example of it . It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too ."
Emma Woodhouse	We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe , and with Mrs. Churchill 's temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" There is one thing , Emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution ."
Emma Woodhouse	A man who felt rightly would say at once , simply and resolutely , to Mrs. Churchill-- ` Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience ; but I must go and see my father immediately .
Emma Woodhouse	I shall , therefore , set off to - morrow . '-- If he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" No , "" said Emma , laughing ; "" but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I rather doubt that ."
Emma Woodhouse	You are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , I think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones . I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr. Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill 's situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect .
Emma Woodhouse	I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life .
Emma Woodhouse	I can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man .
Emma Woodhouse	"Had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now . "" "" We shall never agree about him , "" cried Emma ; "" but that is nothing extraordinary ."
Emma Woodhouse	I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : I feel sure that he is not .
Emma Woodhouse	"I dare say he has ; and though it may cut him off from some advantages , it will secure him many others . "" "" Yes ; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move , and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure , and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it ."
Emma Woodhouse	His letters disgust me .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Your feelings are singular ."
Emma Woodhouse	"They seem to satisfy every body else . "" "" I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston ."
Emma Woodhouse	They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother 's place , but without a mother 's affection to blind her
Emma Woodhouse	.
Emma Woodhouse	It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due , and she must doubly feel the omission .
Emma Woodhouse	Had she been a person of consequence herself , he would have come I dare say ; and it would not have signified whether he did or no .
Emma Woodhouse	Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ?
Emma Woodhouse	Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ?
Emma Woodhouse	No , Emma , your amiable young man can be amiable only in French , not in English .
Emma Woodhouse	""" My idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable ."
Emma Woodhouse	To you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him .
Emma Woodhouse	"My dear Emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point . "" "" I will say no more about him , "" cried Emma , "" you turn every thing to evil . We are both prejudiced ; you against , I for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here ."
Emma Woodhouse	I am not prejudiced .
Emma Woodhouse	""" But I am very much , and without being at all ashamed of it ."
Emma Woodhouse	"My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour . "" "" He is a person I never think of from one month 's end to another , "" said Mr. Knightley , with a degree of vexation , which made Emma immediately talk of something else , though she could not comprehend why he should be angry ."
Emma Woodhouse	To take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another . VOLUME II
Emma Woodhouse	During his present short stay , Emma had barely seen him ; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over , and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension , now spread over his air . She was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again .
Emma Woodhouse	She wished him very well ; but he gave her pain , and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction .
Emma Woodhouse	Of the lady , individually , Emma thought very little . She was good enough for Mr. Elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for Highbury-- handsome enough -- to look plain , probably , by Harriet 's side .
Emma Woodhouse	As to connexion , there Emma was perfectly easy ; persuaded , that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet , he had done nothing .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney , and too stupid to rise . And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister , who was _ very _ _ well _ _ married _ , to a gentleman in a _ great _ _ way _ , near Bristol , who kept two carriages !
Emma Woodhouse	Emma saw him only once ; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure _ just _ to meet with him , or _ just _ to miss him , _ just _ to hear his voice , or see his shoulder , _ just _ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture .
Emma Woodhouse	She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her . Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins 's happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached!-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love ! Had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of Harriet 's mind , Emma would have been amused by its variations . Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated , sometimes the Martins ; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other .
Emma Woodhouse	While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin 's visit .
Emma Woodhouse	It must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!-- After much thinking , she could determine on nothing better , than Harriet 's returning the visit ; but in a way that , if they had understanding , should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance .
Emma Woodhouse	She meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the Abbey Mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future .
Emma Woodhouse	She could think of nothing better : and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve -- something of ingratitude , merely glossed over -- it must be done , or what would become of Harriet ?
Emma Woodhouse	Dinner - parties and evening - parties were made for him and his lady ; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I see how it is , "" said she ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I see what a life I am to lead among you ."
Emma Woodhouse	Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated .
Emma Woodhouse	"From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss . """
Emma Woodhouse	No invitation came amiss to her .
Emma Woodhouse	Her Bath habits made evening - parties perfectly natural to her , and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners .
Emma Woodhouse	She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout - cakes , and there being no ice in the Highbury card - parties .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Bates , Mrs. Perry , Mrs. Goddard and others , were a good deal behind - hand in knowledge of the world , but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged . In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card - tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and in the proper order .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma , in the meanwhile , could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons .
Emma Woodhouse	They must not do less than others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions , and imagined capable of pitiful resentment .
Emma Woodhouse	After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes , Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness , and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself , with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him . The persons to be invited , required little thought .
Emma Woodhouse	Besides the Eltons , it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; so far it was all of course-- and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction , and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet 's begging to be allowed to decline it .
Emma Woodhouse	"If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home . "" It was precisely what Emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing ."
Emma Woodhouse	She was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend -- for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home ; and she could now invite the
Emma Woodhouse	whom she really wanted to make the eighth ,
Emma Woodhouse	Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley , she was more conscience - stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been.--Mr
Emma Woodhouse	. Knightley 's words dwelt with her .
Emma Woodhouse	"He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her . "" This is very true , "" said she , "" at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--"
Emma Woodhouse	and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend.--
Emma Woodhouse	She will never like me now .
Emma Woodhouse	I have neglected her too long .
Emma Woodhouse	But I will shew her greater attention than I have done .
Emma Woodhouse	The two eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring , and their papa now proposed bringing them , and staying one whole day at Hartfield -- which one day would be the very day of this party.--His professional engagements did not allow of his being put off , but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear-- and here would be a ninth -- and Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty - eight hours without falling in with a dinner - party .
Emma Woodhouse	She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself , by representing that though he certainly would make them nine , yet he always said so little , that the increase of noise would be very immaterial . She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself , to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother .
Emma Woodhouse	The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease ; and the seeing him so , with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate , removed the chief of even Emma 's vexation .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Elton , as elegant as lace and pearls could make her , he looked at in silence-- wanting only to observe enough for Isabella 's information -- but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl , and he could talk to her . He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys , when it had been just beginning to rain .
Emma Woodhouse	"My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield . "" The kind - hearted , polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty , and made every fair lady welcome and easy ."
Emma Woodhouse	But for that reason , I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get . Isabella and Emma , I think , do write very much alike .
Emma Woodhouse	I know what you mean -- but Emma 's hand is the strongest .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Isabella and Emma both write beautifully , "" said Mr. Woodhouse ; "" and always did ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I never saw any gentleman 's handwriting""--Emma began , looking also at Mrs. Weston ; but stopped , on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending to some one else -- and the pause gave her time to reflect , "" Now , how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ?"
Emma Woodhouse	Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend-- your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way , I suppose , if I were very bad.--No , I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress . I certainly get better and better.--Now for it .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--""Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman 's hands I ever saw ."
Emma Woodhouse	No , she had heard from him very lately , but having answered the letter , had put it away .
Emma Woodhouse	""" If we were in the other room , "" said Emma , "" if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I have a note of his.-- Do not you remember , Mrs. Weston , employing him to write for you one day ? "" "" He chose to say he was employed""-- "" Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley . """
Emma Woodhouse	Jane 's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	She had heard and seen it all ; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any .
Emma Woodhouse	She suspected that it _ had _ ; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear , and that it had not been in vain . She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual -- a glow both of complexion and spirits .
Emma Woodhouse	She could have made an inquiry or two , as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue 's end-- but she abstained .
Emma Woodhouse	She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax 's feelings ; and they followed the other ladies out of the room , arm in arm , with an appearance of good - will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each .
Emma Woodhouse	Besides the Eltons , it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; so far it was all of course-- and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction , and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet 's begging to be allowed to decline it .
Emma Woodhouse	""" She would rather not be in his company more than she could help ."
Emma Woodhouse	She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable .
Emma Woodhouse	"If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home . "" It was precisely what Emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing ."
Emma Woodhouse	She was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend -- for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home ; and she could now invite the
Emma Woodhouse	"when a gallant young man , like Mr. Frank Churchill , "" said Mr. Knightley dryly , "" writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best ."
Emma Woodhouse	For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present . She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard 's , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days . While she was gone , Mr. Knightley called , and sat some time with Mr. Woodhouse and Emma , till Mr. Woodhouse , who had previously made up his mind to walk out , was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it , and was induced by the entreaties of both , though against the scruples of his own civility , to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , I believe , if you will excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing , I shall take Emma 's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dear sir , do not make a stranger of me . "" "" I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma will be happy to entertain you .
Emma Woodhouse	"I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you . "" Mr. Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr. Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat . He began speaking of Harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma knew this was too true for contradiction , and therefore said nothing .
Emma Woodhouse	"He presently added , with a smile , "" I do not pretend to fix on times or places , but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage . "" "" Indeed !"
Emma Woodhouse	"of what sort ? "" "" A very serious sort , I assure you ; "" still smiling . "" Very serious !"
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton 's having dropt a hint .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr. Elton looked up to him .
Emma Woodhouse	""" He is very obliging , "" said Emma ; "" but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Pray , Mr. Knightley , "" said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , "" how do you know that Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday ?"
Emma Woodhouse	"to be sure , "" cried Emma , "" it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer . "" "" You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma , this is your doing .
Emma Woodhouse	You persuaded her to refuse him .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" And if I did , ( which , however , I am far from allowing ) I should not feel that I had done wrong ."
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man , but I can not admit him to be Harriet 's equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her . By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you .
Emma Woodhouse	"Even _ your _ satisfaction I made sure of . It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend 's leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well . I remember saying to myself , ` Even Emma , with all her partiality for Harriet , will think this a good match . ' "" "" I can not help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing ."
Emma Woodhouse	I assure you mine are very different . I must think your statement by no means fair .
Emma Woodhouse	If she has it now , you have given it .
Emma Woodhouse	You have been no friend to Harriet Smith , Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	""" It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion ; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again . """
Emma Woodhouse	You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet .
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet 's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice . Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too ."
Emma Woodhouse	Better be without sense , than misapply it as you do .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone .
Emma Woodhouse	She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable .
Emma Woodhouse	Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence , with only one attempt on Emma 's side to talk of the weather , but he made no answer .
Emma Woodhouse	"Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain . "" Emma laughed and disclaimed ."
Emma Woodhouse	He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet 's .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I am very much obliged to you , "" said Emma , laughing again ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton 's marrying Harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself ."
Emma Woodhouse	I have done with match - making indeed .
Emma Woodhouse	I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls . I shall leave off while I am well .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Good morning to you,""--said he , rising and walking off abruptly ."
Emma Woodhouse	He felt the disappointment of the young man , and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it , by the sanction he had given ; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair , was provoking him exceedingly .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma remained in a state of vexation too ; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her 's , than in his .
Emma Woodhouse	She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary 's wrong , as Mr. Knightley .
Emma Woodhouse	He walked off in more complete self - approbation than he left for her .
Emma Woodhouse	She was not so materially cast down , however , but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives .
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet 's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy . The possibility of the young man 's coming to Mrs. Goddard 's that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas . The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton .
Emma Woodhouse	the place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was .
Emma Woodhouse	To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself . She could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour 's uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each .
Emma Woodhouse	This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day 's visit might not afford , which certainly did not belong to the present half - hour ; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston , her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful to Emma , and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton 's oddities , or of any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost
Emma Woodhouse	The misfortune of Harriet 's cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella 's coming , and of Emma 's being to follow ,
Emma Woodhouse	had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs. Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma 's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion .
Emma Woodhouse	"Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of "" Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!""-- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs. Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners ."
Emma Woodhouse	For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet 's , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton 's nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to .
Emma Woodhouse	"She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words "" my son , "" and "" Frank , "" and "" my son , "" repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward ."
Emma Woodhouse	Now , it so happened that in spite of Emma 's resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill , which always interested her .
Emma Woodhouse	She had frequently thought -- especially since his father 's marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _ were _ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition .
Emma Woodhouse	He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her . She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations . With such sensations , Mr. Elton 's civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--
Emma Woodhouse	"for when happily released from Mr. Elton , and seated by Mr. Weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her , "" We want only two more to be just the right number ."
Emma Woodhouse	I should like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend , Miss Smith , and my son -- and then I should say we were quite complete . I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting Frank .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete .
Emma Woodhouse	"and Mrs. Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him , that she must be almost as happy as yourself . "" "" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off ."
Emma Woodhouse	The case , you see , is--(but this is quite between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room .
Emma Woodhouse	There are secrets in all families , you know)--The case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January ; and that Frank 's coming depends upon their being put off . If they are not put off , he can not stir .
Emma Woodhouse	I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January , as I am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at Hartfield , that she can not calculate on their effects , as I have been long in the practice of doing .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case , "" replied Emma ; "" but am disposed to side with you , Mr. Weston ."
Emma Woodhouse	If you think he will come , I shall think so too ; for you know Enscombe .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs. Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy-- yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.-- Mrs. Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : "" for I can not depend upon his coming ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of Mrs. Churchill , which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" My Emma ! "" replied Mrs. Weston , smiling , "" what is the certainty of caprice ? """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston . She should then have heard more : Mrs. Weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge .
Emma Woodhouse	"While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying , "" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain ."
Emma Woodhouse	I am sorry for it .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" He ought to come , "" said Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" One ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but Enscombe , I believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _ she _ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her . "" "" But she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite . Now , according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _ him _ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all . "" "" My dearest Emma , do not pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a bad one , or to lay down rules for it : you must let it go its own way . I have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _ when _ it will be . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma listened , and then coolly said , "" I shall not be satisfied , unless he comes . """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma and Harriet went together ; Miss Bates and her niece , with the Eltons ; the gentlemen on horseback .
Emma Woodhouse	The Eltons walked together ; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill .
Emma Woodhouse	At first it was downright dulness to Emma . She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid .
Emma Woodhouse	He said nothing worth hearing-- looked without seeing -- admired without intelligence -- listened without knowing what she said .
Emma Woodhouse	When they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object .
Emma Woodhouse	Every distinguishing attention that could be paid , was paid to her .
Emma Woodhouse	To amuse her , and be agreeable in her eyes , seemed all that he cared for -- and Emma , glad to be enlivened , not sorry to be flattered , was gay and easy too , and gave him all the friendly encouragement , the admission to be gallant , which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance ; but which now , in her own estimation , meant nothing , though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively . """
Emma Woodhouse	Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity ; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected .
Emma Woodhouse	She laughed because she was disappointed ; and though she liked him for his attentions , and thought them all , whether in friendship , admiration , or playfulness , extremely judicious , they were not winning back her heart .
Emma Woodhouse	She still intended him for her friend .
Emma Woodhouse	""" How much I am obliged to you , "" said he , "" for telling me to come to - day!-- If it had not been for you , I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! no , no""--cried Emma , laughing as carelessly as she could-- "" Upon no account in the world ."
Emma Woodhouse	It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now .
Emma Woodhouse	Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of .
Emma Woodhouse	I will not say quite all .
Emma Woodhouse	There are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet , ) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing .
Emma Woodhouse	"Every body knows what is due to _ you _ . "" "" It will not do , "" whispered Frank to Emma ; "" they are most of them affronted ."
Emma Woodhouse	I will attack them with more address .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma could not resist .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" No , no , "" said Emma , "" it will not reckon low ."
Emma Woodhouse	Come , sir , pray let me hear it .
Emma Woodhouse	I am sure I do not know .
Emma Woodhouse	you will never guess .
Emma Woodhouse	You , ( to Emma ) , I am certain , will never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em - ma.--Do you understand ?
Emma Woodhouse	It might be a very indifferent piece of wit , but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it -- and so did Frank and
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Woodhouse must excuse me .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes , yes , pray pass _ me _ , "" added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; "" _ I _ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse , or any other young lady ."
Emma Woodhouse	Will you ?
Emma Woodhouse	( turning to Emma . ) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I
Emma Woodhouse	am sure I should like any body fixed on by you .
Emma Woodhouse	You provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father ) .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" And make her like myself . "" "" By all means , if you can . "" "" Very well . I undertake the commission ."
Emma Woodhouse	"You shall have a charming wife . "" "" She must be very lively , and have hazle eyes ."
Emma Woodhouse	I shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when I return , I shall come to you for my wife .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma was in no danger of forgetting ."
Emma Woodhouse	Hazle eyes excepted , two years more might make her all that he wished . He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Weston , his son , Emma , and Harriet , only remained ; and the young man 's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant .
Emma Woodhouse	Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment , and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others , or sitting almost alone , and quite unattended to , in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her . The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _ her _ carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure .
Emma Woodhouse	Such another scheme , composed of so many ill - assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again .
Emma Woodhouse	While waiting for the carriage , she found Mr. Knightley by her side .
Emma Woodhouse	"He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said , "" Emma , I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but I must still use it . I can not see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance ."
Emma Woodhouse	How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates ?
Emma Woodhouse	"How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character , age , and situation?-- Emma , I had not thought it possible . "" Emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Nay , how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I dare say she did not understand me . "" "" I assure you she did ."
Emma Woodhouse	She felt your full meaning .
Emma Woodhouse	I wish you could have heard how she talked of it-- with what candour and generosity .
Emma Woodhouse	I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! "" cried Emma , "" I know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her ."
Emma Woodhouse	Were she a woman of fortune , I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner .
Emma Woodhouse	Were she your equal in situation-- but , Emma , consider how far this is from being the case . She is poor ; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to ; and , if she live to old age , must probably sink more .
Emma Woodhouse	Her situation should secure your compassion .
Emma Woodhouse	"You , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _ some _ , ) would be entirely guided by _ your _ treatment of her.--This is not pleasant to you , Emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but I must , I will,--I will tell you truths while I can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now . """
Emma Woodhouse	While they talked , they were advancing towards the carriage ; it was ready ; and , before she could speak again , he had handed her in .
Emma Woodhouse	He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted , and her tongue motionless .
Emma Woodhouse	They were combined only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep concern .
Emma Woodhouse	She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late .
Emma Woodhouse	She continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind .
Emma Woodhouse	She was vexed beyond what could have been expressed -- almost beyond what she could conceal .
Emma Woodhouse	Never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in her life .
Emma Woodhouse	She was most forcibly struck .
Emma Woodhouse	She felt it at her heart .
Emma Woodhouse	How could she have been so brutal , so cruel to Miss Bates !
Emma Woodhouse	How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued ! And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude , of concurrence , of common kindness ! Time did not compose her .
Emma Woodhouse	As she reflected more , she seemed but to feel it more .
Emma Woodhouse	She never had been so depressed .
Emma Woodhouse	There was only Harriet , who seemed not in spirits herself , fagged , and very willing to be silent ; and Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home , without being at any trouble to check them , extraordinary as they were .
Emma Woodhouse	I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse ( who , wherever she is , presides ) to say , that she desires to know what you are all thinking of ?
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Bates said a great deal ; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse 's presiding ; Mr. Knightley 's answer was the most distinct .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ?"
Emma Woodhouse	Ladies and gentlemen -- I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way .
Emma Woodhouse	Here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already , ) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated -- or two things moderately clever-- or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all .
Emma Woodhouse	Yes , I see what she means , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) and I will try to hold my tongue .
Emma Woodhouse	I must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend .
Emma Woodhouse	"I dare say she did not understand me . "" "" I assure you she did ."
Emma Woodhouse	She felt your full meaning .
Emma Woodhouse	She has talked of it since .
Emma Woodhouse	I wish you could have heard how she talked of it-- with what candour and generosity .
Emma Woodhouse	I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! "" cried Emma , "" I know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" They are blended , "" said he , "" I acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good ."
Emma Woodhouse	Were she a woman of fortune , I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner .
Emma Woodhouse	Were she your equal in situation-- but , Emma , consider how far this is from being the case . She is poor ; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to ; and , if she live to old age , must probably sink more .
Emma Woodhouse	Her situation should secure your compassion .
Emma Woodhouse	"You , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _ some _ , ) would be entirely guided by _ your _ treatment of her.--This is not pleasant to you , Emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but I must , I will,--I will tell you truths while I can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now . """
Emma Woodhouse	If Emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr. Knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty . A very few days brought the party from London , and she had no
Emma Woodhouse	, than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was!-- that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley , and was now forming all her views of happiness .
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet was a little distressed -- did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend 's approbation , Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--
Emma Woodhouse	But what did such particulars explain?-- The fact was , as Emma could now acknowledge , that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin ; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this , it must ever be unintelligible to Emma . The event , however , was most joyful ; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet 's
Emma Woodhouse	She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!-- It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr. Elton!-- The stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed .
Emma Woodhouse	No objection was raised on the father 's side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin , who was now introduced at Hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend . She had no doubt of Harriet 's happiness with any good - tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement . She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness . She would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out . She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;--or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself .
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins , was less and less at Hartfield ; which was not to be regretted.-- The intimacy between her and Emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner .
Emma Woodhouse	Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them ,
Emma Woodhouse	, indeed , at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.--Robert
Emma Woodhouse	The intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield , to allow them the fortnight 's absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan.--John and Isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it .
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet Smith 's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing .
Emma Woodhouse	Quick and decided in her ways , Emma lost no time in inviting , encouraging , and telling her to come very often ; and as their acquaintance increased , so did their satisfaction in each other .
Emma Woodhouse	As a walking companion , Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her .
Emma Woodhouse	In that respect Mrs. Weston 's loss had been important .
Emma Woodhouse	Her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk , or his short , as the year varied ; and since Mrs. Weston 's marriage her exercise had been too much confined .
Emma Woodhouse	She had ventured once alone to Randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a Harriet Smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges .
Emma Woodhouse	But in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs .
Emma Woodhouse	Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith 's being exactly the young friend she wanted -- exactly the something which her home required .
Emma Woodhouse	Such a friend as Mrs. Weston
Emma Woodhouse	Two such she did not want .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem . Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful .
Emma Woodhouse	For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done ; for Harriet every thing .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked -- but she could never believe that in the same situation _ she _ should not have discovered the truth .
Emma Woodhouse	She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her ; and looked no farther .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation -- and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey - Mill Farm , it must have been the whole .
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma encouraged her talkativeness -- amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin 's having "" _ two _ parlours , two very good parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard 's drawing - room ; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five - and - twenty years with her ; and of their having eight cows , two of them Alderneys , and one a little Welch cow , a very pretty little Welch cow indeed ; and of Mrs. Martin 's saying as she was so fond of it , it should be called _ her _ cow ; and of their having a very handsome summer - house in their garden , where some day next year they were all to drink tea:--a very handsome summer - house , large enough to hold a dozen people . """
Emma Woodhouse	For some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose .
Emma Woodhouse	She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son 's wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs. Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever . With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Martin had told her one day ( and there was a blush as she said it , ) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son , and therefore she was sure , whenever he married , he would make a good husband .
Emma Woodhouse	Not that she _ wanted _ him to marry .
Emma Woodhouse	She was in no hurry at all .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well done , Mrs. Martin ! "" thought Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" You know what you are about . "" "" And when she had come away , Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen . Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday , and asked all the three teachers , Miss Nash , and Miss Prince , and Miss Richardson , to sup with her . "" """
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh yes!--that is , no -- I do not know -- but I believe he has read a good deal -- but not what you would think any thing of ."
Emma Woodhouse	One does not , you know , after a time .
Emma Woodhouse	But did you never see him ?
Emma Woodhouse	He has passed you very often .
Emma Woodhouse	It is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed -- I mean by sight .
Emma Woodhouse	What do you imagine his age to be ?
Emma Woodhouse	They have no indoors man , else they do not want for any thing ; and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year .
Emma Woodhouse	"I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins , especially Elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me . But if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly I had better not visit her , if I can help it . "" Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love ."
Emma Woodhouse	The young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on Harriet 's side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own . They met Mr. Martin the very next day , as they were walking on the Donwell road .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin .
Emma Woodhouse	His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet 's inclination .
Emma Woodhouse	""" How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I wonder he did not remember the book""--was all Harriet 's answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself . She , therefore , said no more for some time ."
Emma Woodhouse	She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr. Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet 's head . She thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it . She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict .
Emma Woodhouse	It was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet 's coming to Hartfield . The longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency .
Emma Woodhouse	He had a comfortable home for her , and Emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world .
Emma Woodhouse	She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet 's there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy .
Emma Woodhouse	He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin 's riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton 's admiration .
Emma Woodhouse	No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man 's company . She was to convey Harriet , and they drove to the Crown in good time , the Randalls party just sufficiently before them .
Emma Woodhouse	They all walked about together , to see that every thing was as it should be ; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage , which Emma could not hear the sound of at first , without great surprize .
Emma Woodhouse	""" So unreasonably early ! "" she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help Mr. Weston 's judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston depended , and felt , that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity .
Emma Woodhouse	She liked his open manners , but a little less of open - heartedness would have made him a higher character.--General benevolence , but not general friendship , made a man what he ought to be.-- She could fancy such a man . The whole party walked about , and looked , and praised again ; and then , having nothing else to do , formed a sort of half - circle round the fire , to observe in their various modes , till other subjects were started , that , though _ May _ , a fire in the evening was still very pleasant .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston 's fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger .
Emma Woodhouse	Frank was standing by her , but not steadily ; there was a restlessness , which shewed a mind not at ease . He was looking about , he was going to the door , he was watching for the sound of other carriages,-- impatient to begin , or afraid of being always near her .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Elton was spoken of .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I think she must be here soon , "" said he ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton , I have heard so much of her ."
Emma Woodhouse	"It can not be long , I think , before she comes . """
Emma Woodhouse	"He was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said , "" I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her ."
Emma Woodhouse	I have never seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton .
Emma Woodhouse	"I have no business to put myself forward . "" Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared ; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" We thought you were to bring them . "" The mistake had been slight ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma longed to know what Frank 's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be ; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress , and her smiles of graciousness . He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion , by giving her very proper attention , after the introduction had passed .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Weston was following ; but Mrs. Elton detained him , to gratify him by her opinion of his son ; and so briskly did she begin , that the young man himself , though by no means moving slowly , could hardly be out of hearing .
Emma Woodhouse	You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him.--You
Emma Woodhouse	may believe me .
Emma Woodhouse	I never compliment .
Emma Woodhouse	I think him a very handsome young man , and his manners are precisely what I like and approve -- so truly the gentleman , without the least conceit or puppyism .
Emma Woodhouse	You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies-- quite a horror of them .
Emma Woodhouse	Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them ; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things !
Emma Woodhouse	"Selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better . "" While she talked of his son , Mr. Weston 's attention was chained ; but when she got to Maple Grove , he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to , and with happy smiles must hurry away ."
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane ."
Emma Woodhouse	Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.-- What a pleasure it is to send one 's carriage for a friend!-- I understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary .
Emma Woodhouse	"You may be very sure I shall always take care of _ them _ . """
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs. Weston 's to receive them .
Emma Woodhouse	"Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma ; but her words , every body 's words , were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates , who came in talking , and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire . As the door opened she was heard , "" So very obliging of you!--No rain at all ."
Emma Woodhouse	This is brilliant indeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived , upon my word .
Emma Woodhouse	I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance .
Emma Woodhouse	"` Oh ! Mrs. Stokes , ' said I-- but I had not time for more . """
Emma Woodhouse	"She was now met by Mrs. Weston.-- "" Very well , I thank you , ma'am ."
Emma Woodhouse	I hope you are quite well .
Emma Woodhouse	dear Mrs. Elton , so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent time .
Emma Woodhouse	Jane and I quite ready .
Emma Woodhouse	and I am sure our thanks are due to you , Mrs. Weston , on that score .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been.--
Emma Woodhouse	I said to my mother , ` Upon my word , ma'am-- . ' Thank you , my mother is remarkably well .
Emma Woodhouse	I made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl-- Mrs. Dixon 's wedding - present.--So kind of her to think of my mother !
Emma Woodhouse	My dear Jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two , but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely-- and there was a mat to step upon -- I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh !
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Frank Churchill , I must tell you my mother 's spectacles have never been in fault since ; the rivet never came out again .
Emma Woodhouse	My mother often talks of your good - nature .
Emma Woodhouse	Very well I thank you , quite well .
Emma Woodhouse	This is meeting quite in fairy - land!-- Such a transformation!--Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude -- but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look -- how do you like Jane 's hair?--You are a judge.-- She did it all herself .
Emma Woodhouse	No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah !
Emma Woodhouse	Dr. Hughes I declare-- and Mrs. Hughes .
Emma Woodhouse	How do you do?--Very well , I thank you .
Emma Woodhouse	How do you do , Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- Mrs. Otway , I protest!-- and good Mr. Otway , and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do ?
Emma Woodhouse	How do you all do?--Quite well , I am much obliged to you .
Emma Woodhouse	Never better.-- Do n't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very
Emma Woodhouse	likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends !
Emma Woodhouse	And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted .
Emma Woodhouse	No coffee , I thank you , for me -- never take coffee.--A little tea if you please , sir , by and bye,--no hurry -- Oh !
Emma Woodhouse	Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma ; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her.--He was thoughtful .
Emma Woodhouse	"After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look , compliments very quietly and properly taken , Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself-- and it was , "" How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?-- How has Wright done my hair?""--with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Mrs. Elton then said , "" Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do -- but upon such an occasion as this , when every body 's eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the Westons -- who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour -- I would not wish to be inferior to others . And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.--"
Emma Woodhouse	So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand.--We shall see if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill .
Emma Woodhouse	I like him very well .
Emma Woodhouse	""" At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously , that Emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises , and did not want to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while , till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton 's tones again distinctly forward.--Mr . Elton had just joined them , and his wife was exclaiming , "" Oh ! you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion?-- I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Jane!""--repeated Frank Churchill , with a look of surprize and displeasure.-- "" That is easy -- but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" How do you like Mrs. Elton ? "" said Emma in a whisper ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Then changing from a frown to a smile--""No , do not tell me -- I do not want to know what you mean.-- Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing ? """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour .
Emma Woodhouse	He walked off to find his father , but was quickly back again with both Mr. and Mrs. Weston .
Emma Woodhouse	He had met with them in a little perplexity , which must be laid before Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	"It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude . "" And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ? "" said Mr. Weston ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" She will think Frank ought to ask her . """
Emma Woodhouse	Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of --
Emma Woodhouse	and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _ him _ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon.-- Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way , Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed . Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .
Emma Woodhouse	It was almost enough to make her think of marrying .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Weston might be his son 's superior.-- In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.-- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley 's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself . His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body 's eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave .
Emma Woodhouse	She wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like Frank Churchill better.-- He seemed often observing her . She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .
Emma Woodhouse	There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner .
Emma Woodhouse	They seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers . That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done , was indubitable .
Emma Woodhouse	Of very important , very recordable events , it was not more productive than such meetings usually are . There was one , however , which Emma thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun , and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma 's wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about .
Emma Woodhouse	He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room .
Emma Woodhouse	Escape , however , was not his plan .
Emma Woodhouse	He came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it . He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith , or speaking to those who were close to her.--
Emma Woodhouse	Emma saw it .
Emma Woodhouse	She was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all .
Emma Woodhouse	When she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but Mr. Elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by
Emma Woodhouse	significant glances.--The
Emma Woodhouse	"kind - hearted , gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say , "" Do not you dance , Mr. Elton ? "" to which his prompt reply was , "" Most readily , Mrs. Weston , if you will dance with me ."
Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	""" Me!--oh ! no -- I would get you a better partner than myself ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance , "" said he , "" I shall have great pleasure , I am sure -- for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- Miss Smith . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You"
Emma Woodhouse	are extremely obliging-- and if I were not an old married man.--But
Emma Woodhouse	my dancing days are over , Mrs. Weston .
Emma Woodhouse	Any thing else I should be most happy to do , at your command -- but my dancing days are over .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston said no more ; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat .
Emma Woodhouse	She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife .
Emma Woodhouse	She would not look again .
Emma Woodhouse	Her heart was in a glow , and she feared her face might be as hot .
Emma Woodhouse	In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again .
Emma Woodhouse	His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced .
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Elton had retreated into the card - room , looking ( Emma trusted ) very foolish . She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her;--_she _ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner , "" Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very"
Emma Woodhouse	", I declare . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Jane , Jane , my dear Jane , where are you?--Here is your tippet ."
Emma Woodhouse	Jane
Emma Woodhouse	Excellent dancing indeed!-- Yes , my dear , I ran home , as I said I should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me.--I
Emma Woodhouse	set off without saying a word , just as I told you .
Emma Woodhouse	Grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ` Oh ! ' said I , ` I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr. Elton ,
Emma Woodhouse	I do not know who will ask her next , perhaps Mr. William Cox .
Emma Woodhouse	My dear sir , you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am not helpless .
Emma Woodhouse	Upon my word ,
Emma Woodhouse	Jane on one arm , and me on the other!--Stop , stop , let us stand a little back , Mrs. Elton is going ; dear Mrs. Elton , how elegant she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train .
Emma Woodhouse	Well , I was persuaded there were two .
Emma Woodhouse	I was convinced there were two , and there is but one .
Emma Woodhouse	I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style -- Candles everywhere.--I was telling you of your grandmama , Jane,--There was a little disappointment.-- The baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good Mr. Woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again .
Emma Woodhouse	Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus-- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned!--Well , this is brilliant ! I am all amazement !
Emma Woodhouse	could not have supposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it
Emma Woodhouse	do you recommend this side?--Well , I am sure , Mr. Churchill-- only it seems too good -- but just as you please .
Emma Woodhouse	"I should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and I can not help beginning . """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked .
Emma Woodhouse	"He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton 's conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and Mrs. Elton 's looks also received the due share of censure . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"He looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added , "" _ She _ ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be.--To that surmise"
Emma Woodhouse	, you say nothing , of course ; but confess , Emma , that you did want him to marry Harriet .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I did , "" replied Emma , "" and they can not forgive me ."
Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	I leave you to your own reflections .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong , I am sure the other tells you of it . "" "" I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton ."
Emma Woodhouse	There is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which I did not : and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet .
Emma Woodhouse	"It was through a series of strange blunders ! "" "" And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs. Elton is totally without ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Come Miss Woodhouse , Miss Otway , Miss Fairfax , what are you all doing?-- Come Emma , set your companions the example ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Every body is asleep ! "" "" I am ready , "" said Emma , "" whenever I am wanted ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Whom are you going to dance with ? "" asked Mr. Knightley ."
Emma Woodhouse	"She hesitated a moment , and then replied , "" With you , if you will ask me ."
Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	""" Will you ? "" said he , offering his hand ."
Emma Woodhouse	"You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper . """
Emma Woodhouse	here 's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Woodhouse , how do you do?--
Emma Woodhouse	Very well I thank you , quite well .
Emma Woodhouse	This is meeting quite in fairy - land!-- Such a transformation!--Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude -- but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look -- how do you like Jane 's hair?--You are a judge.-- She did it all herself .
Emma Woodhouse	Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.--How do you do ?
Emma Woodhouse	How do you do?--Very well , I thank you .
Emma Woodhouse	How do you do , Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- Mrs. Otway , I protest!-- and good Mr. Otway , and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do ?
Emma Woodhouse	How do you all do?--Quite well , I am much obliged to you .
Emma Woodhouse	and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _ him _ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon.-- Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way , Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed . Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Jane , Jane , my dear Jane , where are you?--Here is your tippet ."
Emma Woodhouse	Grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ` Oh !

Emma Woodhouse	""" Come Miss Woodhouse , Miss Otway , Miss Fairfax , what are you all doing?-- Come Emma , set your companions the example ."
Emma Woodhouse	"IV A very few days had passed after this adventure , when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began : "" Miss Woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- I have something that I should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was a good deal surprized ; but begged her to speak .
Emma Woodhouse	"It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish , "" she continued , "" to have no reserves with you on this subject ."
Emma Woodhouse	As I am happily quite an altered creature in _ one _ _ respect _ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it .
Emma Woodhouse	I do not want to say more than is necessary -- I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes , "" said Emma , "" I hope I do . "" "" How I could so long a time be fancying myself ! . . . "" cried Harriet , warmly ."
Emma Woodhouse	, I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil.--No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment 's pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy --
Emma Woodhouse	"what I ought to have destroyed long ago -- what I ought never to have kept-- I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke).--However , now I will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown . Can not you guess what this parcel holds ? "" said she , with a conscious look ."
Emma Woodhouse	She held the parcel towards her , and Emma read the words _ Most _ _ precious _ _ treasures _ on the top .
Emma Woodhouse	Her curiosity was greatly excited .
Emma Woodhouse	Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge - ware box , which Harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , Emma saw only a small piece of court - plaister .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Now , "" said Harriet , "" you _ must _ recollect . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Dear me ! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat -- just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came-- I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister?-- But , as you had none about you , and knew I had , you desired me to supply him ; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dearest Harriet ! "" cried Emma , putting her hand before her face , and jumping up , "" you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear ."
Emma Woodhouse	Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic -- I knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me!--Oh !
Emma Woodhouse	my sins , my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in
Emma Woodhouse	my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I
Emma Woodhouse	deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)-- go on -- what else ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" And had you really some at hand yourself ? I am sure I never suspected it , you did it so naturally ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" And so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake ! "" said Emma , recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement ."
Emma Woodhouse	"And secretly she added to herself , "" Lord bless me !"
Emma Woodhouse	when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about !
Emma Woodhouse	"I never was equal to this . "" "" Here , "" resumed Harriet , turning to her box again , "" here is something still more valuable , I mean that _ has _ _ been _ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did . """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure .
Emma Woodhouse	""" This was really his , "" said Harriet.--""Do not you remember one morning?--no , I dare say you do not ."
Emma Woodhouse	"But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment . "" "" I do remember it , "" cried Emma ; "" I perfectly remember it.-- Talking about spruce - beer.--Oh ! yes -- Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr. Elton 's seeming resolved to learn to like it too ."
Emma Woodhouse	I perfectly remember it.--Stop ; Mr. Knightley was standing just here , was not he ?
Emma Woodhouse	I have an idea he was standing just here .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ah ! I do not know ."
Emma Woodhouse	I can not recollect.--It
Emma Woodhouse	"but I can not recollect.--Mr . Elton was sitting here , I remember , much about where I am now . ""--"
Emma Woodhouse	"I have nothing more to shew you , or to say-- except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and I wish you to see me do it . "" "" My poor dear Harriet !"
Emma Woodhouse	"I must get rid of every thing.-- There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven ! of Mr. Elton . "" "" And when , "" thought Emma , "" will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill ? "" She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made , and could not but hope that the gipsy , though she had _ told _ no fortune , might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight after the alarm , they came to a sufficient explanation , and quite undesignedly ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was not thinking of it at the moment , which made the information she received more valuable .
Emma Woodhouse	"She merely said , in the course of some trivial chat , "" Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so""--and thought no more of it , till after a minute 's silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone , "" I shall never marry . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma then looked up , and immediately saw how it was ; and after a moment 's debate , as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not , replied , "" Never marry!--This is a new resolution . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Elton indeed ! "" cried Harriet indignantly.--""Oh ! no""--and Emma could just catch the words , "" so superior to Mr. Elton ! """
Emma Woodhouse	She then took a longer time for consideration .
Emma Woodhouse	Should she proceed no farther?--should she let it pass , and seem to suspect nothing?--
Emma Woodhouse	Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances
Emma Woodhouse	, she was perfectly resolved.--
Emma Woodhouse	She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once , all that she meant to say and know .
Emma Woodhouse	"She had previously determined how far she would proceed , on any application of the sort ; and it would be safer for both , to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.-- She was decided , and thus spoke-- "" Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning ."
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Woodhouse , believe me I have not the presumption to suppose-- Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance -- and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world , with the gratitude , wonder , and veneration , which are so proper , in me especially .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am not at all surprized at you , Harriet ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend .
Emma Woodhouse	Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind-- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation .
Emma Woodhouse	VII The very day of Mr. Elton 's going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma 's services towards her friend .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was half - ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon my word , "" she cried , "" the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking ."
Emma Woodhouse	"He will connect himself well if he can . "" "" Will you read the letter ? "" cried Harriet ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Pray do . I 'd rather you would . "" Emma was not sorry to be pressed ."
Emma Woodhouse	She read , and was surprized .
Emma Woodhouse	The style of the letter was much above her expectation .
Emma Woodhouse	"She paused over it , while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a "" Well , well , "" and was at last forced to add , "" Is it a good letter ? or is it too short ? "" "" Yes , indeed , a very good letter , "" replied Emma rather slowly--""so good a letter , Harriet , that every thing considered , I think one of his sisters must have helped him ."
Emma Woodhouse	I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman .
Emma Woodhouse	No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words .
Emma Woodhouse	Yes , I understand the sort of mind .
Emma Woodhouse	A better written letter , Harriet ( returning it , ) than I had expected .
Emma Woodhouse	"I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it . "" Harriet was silent . With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued : "" You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect ."
Emma Woodhouse	"For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say , "" I lay it down as a general rule , Harriet , that if a woman _ doubts _ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him . If she can hesitate as to ` Yes , ' she ought to say ` No ' directly . It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings , with half a heart . I thought it my duty as a friend , and older than yourself , to say thus much to you . But do not imagine that I want to influence you . "" "" Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me what I had best do -- No , no , I do not mean that --
Emma Woodhouse	As you say , one 's mind ought to be quite made up --
Emma Woodhouse	"It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say ` No , ' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say ` No ? ' """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Not for the world , "" said Emma , smiling graciously , "" would I advise you either way . You must be the best judge of your own happiness ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes . At last , with some hesitation , Harriet said-- "" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr. Martin ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too . "" Emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a "" very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence . The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all .
Emma Woodhouse	She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed , "" cried Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	VII The very day of Mr. Elton 's going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma 's services towards her friend .
Emma Woodhouse	"And he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.-- """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was half - ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful .
Emma Woodhouse	Dear Miss Woodhouse , do advise me .
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes . At last , with some hesitation , Harriet said-- "" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr. Martin ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Do you think I am right ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Now I am secure of you for ever . "" Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly . "" You could not have visited me ! "" she cried , looking aghast ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , to be sure you could not ; but I never thought of that before . That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world . "" "" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been ."
Emma Woodhouse	"as to leaving you , it is what I would not do upon any consideration . "" "" Thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence . The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all .
Emma Woodhouse	III Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr. Knightley , who had been of the party , and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side
Emma Woodhouse	", he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma . He had been used to think her unjust to Jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement . "" A very pleasant evening , "" he began , as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary , told that he understood , and the papers swept away;--""particularly pleasant . You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music ."
Emma Woodhouse	I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one 's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	You left nothing undone .
Emma Woodhouse	I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother 's , it must have been a real indulgence .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am happy you approved , "" said Emma , smiling ; "" but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" No , my dear , "" said her father instantly ; "" _ that _ I am sure you are not ."
Emma Woodhouse	There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are .
Emma Woodhouse	If any thing , you are too attentive .
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , "" said Mr. Knightley , nearly at the same time ; "" you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension ."
Emma Woodhouse	I think you understand me , therefore .
Emma Woodhouse	""" An arch look expressed--""I understand you well enough ; "" but she said only , "" Miss Fairfax is reserved . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I always told you she was -- a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" You think her diffident . I do not see it . "" "" My dear Emma , "" said he , moving from his chair into one close by her , "" you are not going to tell me , I hope , that you had not a pleasant evening . "" "" Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	no ; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions ; and amused to think how little information I obtained .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I am disappointed , "" was his only answer ."
Emma Woodhouse	"She must have found the evening agreeable , Mr. Knightley , because she had Emma . "" "" True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax . "" Emma saw his anxiety , and wishing to appease it , at least for the present , said , and with a sincerity which no one could question-- "" She is a sort of elegant creature that one can not keep one 's eyes from . I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart . """
Emma Woodhouse	and I have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon-- Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate -- Hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork -- I think we had better send the leg-- do not you think so , my dear ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" My dear papa , I sent the whole hind - quarter ."
Emma Woodhouse	I knew you would wish it .
Emma Woodhouse	"There will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like . "" "" That 's right , my dear , very right . I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way . They must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , I do not consider it unwholesome . "" "" Emma , "" said Mr. Knightley presently , "" I have a piece of news for you . You like news -- and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you . "" "" News !"
Emma Woodhouse	yes , I always like news .
Emma Woodhouse	"What is it?--why do you smile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Elton is going to be married . "" Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton , and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start , and a little blush , at the sound ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" There is my news:--I thought it would interest you"
Emma Woodhouse	my dear , ' said I -- well , and just then came the note .
Emma Woodhouse	My dear sir , you really are too bountiful .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" We consider our Hartfield pork , "" replied Mr. Woodhouse--""indeed it certainly is , so very superior to all other pork , that Emma and I can not have a greater pleasure than-- "" "" Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us .
Emma Woodhouse	"Well , Mr. Knightley , and so you actually saw the letter ; well-- "" "" It was short -- merely to announce -- but cheerful , exulting , of course . ""-- Here was a sly glance at Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	The information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins . By his style , I should imagine it just settled .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Elton going to be married ! "" said Emma , as soon as she could speak ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Who shall answer that question ? "" cried Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" My father would say ` yes , ' Mr. Knightley ` no ; ' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I say , sir , "" turning to Mr. Woodhouse , "" I think there are few places with such society as Highbury ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork-- a roast loin of pork-- "" "" As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her , "" said Emma , "" nothing I suppose can be known ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Nobody had any information to give ; and , after a few more wonderings , Emma said , "" You are silent , Miss Fairfax -- but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news . You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell 's account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins . """
Emma Woodhouse	Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately ?
Emma Woodhouse	Good morning to you , my dear sir .
Emma Woodhouse	"Well , that is so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm.--Mr . Elton , and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning to you . """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma , alone with her father , had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry-- and to marry strangers too -- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject . It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news , as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long ; but she was sorry for Harriet :
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet must feel it -- and all that she could hope was , by giving the first information herself , to save her from hearing it abruptly from others .
Emma Woodhouse	It was now about the time that she was likely to call .
Emma Woodhouse	"If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning to rain , Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs. Goddard 's , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation . The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the "" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened ! "" which instantly burst forth , had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation ."
Emma Woodhouse	As the blow was given , Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and Harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell .
Emma Woodhouse	I thought I should have fainted .
Emma Woodhouse	I did not know what to do .
Emma Woodhouse	I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella .
Emma Woodhouse	I am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ;
Emma Woodhouse	and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh !
Emma Woodhouse	dear ; I was so miserable !
Emma Woodhouse	I am sure I must have been as white as my gown .
Emma Woodhouse	I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there.--Oh !
Emma Woodhouse	dear , Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another .
Emma Woodhouse	I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would . She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _ try _ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble!--I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind !
Emma Woodhouse	Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable !
Emma Woodhouse	that nothing should stop me from getting away
Emma Woodhouse	I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one ca n't tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole 's stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain .
Emma Woodhouse	dear , I thought it would have been the death of me !
Emma Woodhouse	So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round
Emma Woodhouse	by the stables -- I believe I did -- but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it .
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly .
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so ; but it was not immediately in her power ."
Emma Woodhouse	She was obliged to stop and think .
Emma Woodhouse	She was not thoroughly comfortable herself . The young man 's conduct , and his sister 's , seemed the result of real feeling , and she could not but pity them .
Emma Woodhouse	But she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ? It was folly to be disturbed by it .
Emma Woodhouse	Of course , he must be sorry to lose her -- they must be all sorry .
Emma Woodhouse	"She exerted herself , and did try to make her comfortable , by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle , and quite unworthy of being dwelt on , "" It might be distressing , for the moment , "" said she ; "" but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never-- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Harriet said , "" very true , "" and she "" would not think about it ; "" but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else ; and Emma , at last , in order to put the Martins out of her head , was obliged to hurry on the news , which she had meant to give with so much tender caution ; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry , ashamed or only amused , at such a state of mind in poor Harriet -- such a conclusion of Mr. Elton 's importance with her !"
Emma Woodhouse	Though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before , or an hour before , its interest soon increased ; and before their first conversation was over , she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity , wonder and regret , pain and pleasure , as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins , which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy . Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I hope every body had a pleasant evening , "" said Mr. Woodhouse , in his quiet way ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I had ."
Emma Woodhouse	Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me .
Emma Woodhouse	I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed .
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , Mr. Woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the Bates 's , said-- "" It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined !"
Emma Woodhouse	my dear sir , how are you this morning ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" We consider our Hartfield pork , "" replied Mr. Woodhouse--""indeed it certainly is , so very superior to all other pork , that Emma and I can not have a greater pleasure than-- "" "" Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us .
Emma Woodhouse	""" He is very young to settle , "" was Mr. Woodhouse 's observation . """
Emma Woodhouse	He seemed to me very well off as he was .
Emma Woodhouse	"We were always glad to see him at Hartfield . "" "" A new neighbour for us all , Miss Woodhouse ! "" said Miss Bates , joyfully ; "" my mother is so pleased!--she says she can not bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress ."
Emma Woodhouse	"And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off . "" "" Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse , "" said Miss Bates , "" four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs. Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man -- but'--In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative . "" "" Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all . "" "" Very odd !"
Emma Woodhouse	"I told you he was plain . "" "" My dear , you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself-- "" "" Oh ! as for me , my judgment is worth nothing . Where I have a regard , I always think a person well - looking ."
Emma Woodhouse	You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave .
Emma Woodhouse	I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would . She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _ try _ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble!--I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind !
Emma Woodhouse	Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable !
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly .
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again .
Emma Woodhouse	"She exerted herself , and did try to make her comfortable , by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle , and quite unworthy of being dwelt on , "" It might be distressing , for the moment , "" said she ; "" but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never-- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it . """
Emma Woodhouse	A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill .
Emma Woodhouse	She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him . Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of;-- but if he , who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two , were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away , it would be very distressing .
Emma Woodhouse	If a separation of two months should not have cooled him , there were dangers and evils before her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary .
Emma Woodhouse	She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again , and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his .
Emma Woodhouse	She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration .
Emma Woodhouse	and yet , she could not help rather anticipating something decisive .
Emma Woodhouse	She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis , an event , a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state .
Emma Woodhouse	It was not very long , though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen , before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill 's feelings .
Emma Woodhouse	He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act .
Emma Woodhouse	There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her .
Emma Woodhouse	But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done , of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree .
Emma Woodhouse	She watched him well .
Emma Woodhouse	Absence , with the conviction probably of her indifference , had produced this very natural and very desirable effect .
Emma Woodhouse	It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference .
Emma Woodhouse	Lively as he was , it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but what decided her belief on the subject , was his staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury .
Emma Woodhouse	She had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long .
Emma Woodhouse	His aunt could not bear to have him leave her .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement , and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends-- for the house was taken for May and June . She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish . Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects .
Emma Woodhouse	She hoped it was not so . Two months must bring it to the proof . Mr. Weston 's own happiness was indisputable .
Emma Woodhouse	Now , however , it was absolutely to be ; every preparation was resumed , and very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond , a few lines from Frank , to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change , and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty - four hours at any given time , induced them to name as early a day as possible .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield , James had due notice , and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with them , while dear Emma were gone .
Emma Woodhouse	The remaining five were left to their own powers , and Emma doubted their getting on very well ; for Mr. Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation ; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice , which nobody had inclination to pay , and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent .
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother . He was to leave them early the next day ; and he soon began with-- "" Well , Emma , I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister 's letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure . My charge would be much more concise than her 's , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them . "" "" I rather hope to satisfy you both , "" said Emma , "" for I shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for Isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic . "" "" And if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again ."
Emma Woodhouse	You think so , do not you ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father-- or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Increase ! "" "" Certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life . """
Emma Woodhouse	"No indeed I am not . "" "" There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be ."
Emma Woodhouse	Witness this very time . Here am I come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party!-- When did it happen before , or any thing like it ? Your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it .
Emma Woodhouse	The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Yes , "" said his brother quickly , "" it is Randalls that does it all . "" "" Very well -- and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way ."
Emma Woodhouse	And if they are , I only beg you to send them home .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Upon my word , "" exclaimed Emma , "" you amuse me !"
Emma Woodhouse	I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys .
Emma Woodhouse	Dining once with the Coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place . I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed .
Emma Woodhouse	Jane Fairfax was an orphan , the only child of Mrs. Bates 's youngest daughter .
Emma Woodhouse	The marriage of Lieut . Fairfax of the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ regiment of infantry , and Miss Jane Bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl .
Emma Woodhouse	By birth she belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the fondling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations .
Emma Woodhouse	But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny .
Emma Woodhouse	When he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her .
Emma Woodhouse	He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane 's age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter 's great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .
Emma Woodhouse	The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible .
Emma Woodhouse	To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell 's power ; for though his income , by pay and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter 's ; but , by giving her an education , he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter
Emma Woodhouse	She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education . Living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and Colonel Campbell 's residence being in London , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters .
Emma Woodhouse	Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she
Emma Woodhouse	Neither father nor mother could promote , and the daughter could not endure it .
Emma Woodhouse	It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over . The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane 's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents . They continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of Miss Campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn .
Emma Woodhouse	This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning .
Emma Woodhouse	The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did .
Emma Woodhouse	As long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness:--what must be at last , had better be soon .
Emma Woodhouse	Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished .
Emma Woodhouse	She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter 's marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort .
Emma Woodhouse	With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told .
Emma Woodhouse	"It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- Mr. Frank Churchill -- must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence . Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . But "" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other . """
Emma Woodhouse	These were her reasons-- she had no better .
Emma Woodhouse	It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma could not but feel all this ; and then , her face -- her features-- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered
Emma Woodhouse	Her eyes , a deep grey , with dark eye - lashes and eyebrows , had never been denied their praise ; but the skin , which she had been used to cavil at , as wanting colour , had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom .
Emma Woodhouse	It was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it:--elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in Highbury .
Emma Woodhouse	In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer . When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself . In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon 's actions from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first .
Emma Woodhouse	If it were love , it might be simple , single , successless love on her side alone .
Emma Woodhouse	She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty .
Emma Woodhouse	Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her .
Emma Woodhouse	"These were charming feelings -- but not lasting . Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr. Knightley , "" She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome ! """
Emma Woodhouse	The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane 's offences rose again .
Emma Woodhouse	They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air
Emma Woodhouse	of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance .
Emma Woodhouse	She was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious !
Emma Woodhouse	There was no getting at her real opinion .
Emma Woodhouse	Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing .
Emma Woodhouse	She was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved .
Emma Woodhouse	If any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing .
Emma Woodhouse	She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon 's character , or her own value for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of the match . It was all general approbation and smoothness ; nothing delineated or distinguished .
Emma Woodhouse	It did her no service however .
Emma Woodhouse	Her caution was thrown away .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma saw its artifice , and returned to her first surmises .
Emma Woodhouse	There probably _ was _ something more to conceal than her own preference ; Mr. Dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to Miss Campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds .
Emma Woodhouse	She and Mr. Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time .
Emma Woodhouse	It was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Was he handsome?""--""She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man . """
Emma Woodhouse	"She believed every body found his manners pleasing . """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma could not forgive her .
Emma Woodhouse	VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet 's fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton 's being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet 's side , as there could be any occasion for .
Emma Woodhouse	She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton 's being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already .
Emma Woodhouse	She had no scruple with regard to him .
Emma Woodhouse	He talked of Harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add .
Emma Woodhouse	"His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet 's manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment . "" You have given Miss Smith all that she required , "" said he ; "" you have made her graceful and easy ."
Emma Woodhouse	She was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Great has been the pleasure , I am sure ."
Emma Woodhouse	I never met with a disposition more truly amiable .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I have no doubt of it . """
Emma Woodhouse	She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet 's picture .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Did you ever have your likeness taken , Harriet ? "" said she : "" did you ever sit for your picture ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed , "" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be !"
Emma Woodhouse	I would give any money for it .
Emma Woodhouse	I almost long to attempt her likeness myself .
Emma Woodhouse	You do not know it I dare say , but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general .
Emma Woodhouse	But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust .
Emma Woodhouse	But really , I could almost venture , if Harriet would sit to me .
Emma Woodhouse	"It would be such a delight to have her picture ! "" "" Let me entreat you , "" cried Mr. Elton ; "" it would indeed be a delight !"
Emma Woodhouse	Let me entreat you , Miss Woodhouse , to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend .
Emma Woodhouse	I know what your drawings are .
Emma Woodhouse	How could you suppose me ignorant ?
Emma Woodhouse	Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room , at Randalls ?
Emma Woodhouse	Yes , good man!--thought Emma -- but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" Exactly so -- The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- I have not a doubt of your success ."
Emma Woodhouse	As you will do it , it will indeed , to use your own words , be an exquisite possession .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma wished to go to work directly , and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits , for not one of them had ever been finished , that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet . Her many beginnings were displayed . Miniatures , half - lengths , whole - lengths , pencil , crayon , and water - colours had been all tried in turn .
Emma Woodhouse	She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to .
Emma Woodhouse	She played and sang;--and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of .
Emma Woodhouse	She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician , but she was not unwilling to have others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved .
Emma Woodhouse	There was merit in every drawing -- in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same .
Emma Woodhouse	A likeness pleases every body ; and Miss Woodhouse 's performances must be capital .
Emma Woodhouse	""" No great variety of faces for you , "" said Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I had only my own family to study from ."
Emma Woodhouse	There is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that I could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore .
Emma Woodhouse	always my kindest friend on every occasion .
Emma Woodhouse	She would sit whenever I asked her .
Emma Woodhouse	There is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike .
Emma Woodhouse	I should have made a good likeness of her , if she would have sat longer , but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet . Then , here come all my attempts at three of those four children;--there they are , Henry and John and Bella , from one end of the sheet to the other , and any one of them might do for any one of the rest .
Emma Woodhouse	She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured
Emma Woodhouse	Here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby .
Emma Woodhouse	I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see .
Emma Woodhouse	I am rather proud of little George .
Emma Woodhouse	"Then here is my last,""--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size , whole - length--""my last and my best -- my brother , Mr. John Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished , when I put it away in a pet , and vowed I would never take another likeness ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when I had really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs . Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it _ very _ like)--only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side -- after all this , came poor dear Isabella 's cold approbation of--""Yes , it was a little like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice ."
Emma Woodhouse	"It was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than I could bear ; and so I never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and , as I said , I did then forswear ever drawing any body again . But for Harriet 's sake , or rather for my own , and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _ at _ _ present _ , I will break my resolution now . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , "" No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe . Exactly so ."
Emma Woodhouse	"No husbands and wives , "" with so interesting a consciousness , that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once ."
Emma Woodhouse	But as she wanted to be drawing , the declaration must wait a little longer .
Emma Woodhouse	She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait .
Emma Woodhouse	It was to be a whole - length in water - colours , like Mr. John Knightley 's , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece . The sitting began ; and Harriet , smiling and blushing , and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist .
Emma Woodhouse	But there was no doing any thing , with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch .
Emma Woodhouse	She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence ; but was really obliged to put an end to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere .
Emma Woodhouse	"It then occurred to her to employ him in reading . """
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace .
Emma Woodhouse	She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed.--There was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible .
Emma Woodhouse	She could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable .
Emma Woodhouse	The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day 's sketch to wish to go on .
Emma Woodhouse	There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last ,
Emma Woodhouse	""" By all means . We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party . "" The same civilities and courtesies , the same success and satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid and happy ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted,""--observed Mrs. Weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover.--""The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes ."
Emma Woodhouse	We must allow for the effect of shade , you know .
Emma Woodhouse	""" You have made her too tall , Emma , "" said Mr. Knightley ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr. Elton warmly added , "" Oh no !"
Emma Woodhouse	Consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know .
Emma Woodhouse	Just as your drawings always are , my dear .
Emma Woodhouse	I do not know any body who draws so well as you do .
Emma Woodhouse	"Look at the tree . "" "" But it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world,""--brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and a very few minutes settled the business . Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" This man is almost too gallant to be in love , "" thought Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I should say so , but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love ."
Emma Woodhouse	He is an excellent young man , and will suit Harriet exactly ; it will be an ` Exactly so , ' as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal .
Emma Woodhouse	I come in for a pretty good share as a second .
Emma Woodhouse	The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother 's ; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton 's activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will . Mr. Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more . He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	That Emma was his object appeared indisputable .
Emma Woodhouse	But while so many were devoting him to Emma , and Emma herself making him over to Harriet , Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax .
Emma Woodhouse	He could not understand it ; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least-- symptoms of admiration on his side , which , having once observed , he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish to escape any of Emma 's errors of imagination . _ She _ was not present when the suspicion first arose .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma and Harriet were going to walk ; he joined them ; and , on returning , they fell in with a larger party , who , like themselves , judged it wisest to take their exercise early , as the weather threatened rain ; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son , Miss Bates and her niece , who had accidentally met .
Emma Woodhouse	They all united ; and , on reaching Hartfield gates , Emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him .
Emma Woodhouse	The Randalls party agreed to it immediately ; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates , which few persons listened to , she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse 's most obliging invitation .
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma , you are a great dreamer , I think ? """
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was out of hearing .
Emma Woodhouse	She had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance , and was beyond the reach of Mr. Weston 's hint .
Emma Woodhouse	The dream must be borne with , and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield , and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use , instead of the small - sized Pembroke , on which two of his daily meals had , for forty years been crowded . Tea passed pleasantly , and nobody seemed in a hurry to move .
Emma Woodhouse	"I want to puzzle you again . "" Emma was pleased with the thought ; and producing the box , the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets , which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves ."
Emma Woodhouse	"The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the "" poor little boys , "" or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it . Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax ."
Emma Woodhouse	Frank was next to Emma , Jane opposite to them -- and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them all ; and it was his object to see as much as he could , with as little apparent observation .
Emma Woodhouse	He saw a short word prepared for Emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure .
Emma Woodhouse	"He saw that Emma had soon made it out , and found it highly entertaining , though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure ; for she said , "" Nonsense ! for shame ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"He heard Frank Churchill next say , with a glance towards Jane , "" I will give it to her -- shall I?""--and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth . "" No , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed . "" It was done however ."
Emma Woodhouse	She was immediately up , and wanting to quit the table ; but so many were also moving , that she could not get away ; and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept away by her unexamined . She was afterwards looking for her shawl -- Frank Churchill was looking also -- it was growing dusk , and the room was in confusion ; and how they parted , Mr. Knightley could not tell .
Emma Woodhouse	He remained at Hartfield after all the rest , his thoughts full of what he had seen ; so full , that when the candles came to assist his observations , he must -- yes , he certainly must , as a friend-- an anxious friend -- give Emma some hint , ask her some question .
Emma Woodhouse	He could not see her in a situation of such danger , without trying to preserve her . It was his duty .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Pray , Emma , "" said he , "" may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ?"
Emma Woodhouse	"I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other . "" Emma was extremely confused . She could not endure to give him the true explanation ; for though her suspicions were by no means removed , she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them . "" Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	""" she cried in evident embarrassment , "" it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves . "" "" The joke , "" he replied gravely , "" seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill . "" He had hoped she would speak again , but she did not ."
Emma Woodhouse	She would rather busy herself about any thing than speak .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma 's confusion , and the acknowledged intimacy , seemed to declare her affection engaged . Yet he would speak .
Emma Woodhouse	He owed it to her , to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference , rather than her welfare ; to encounter any thing , rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause .
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dear Emma , "" said he at last , with earnest kindness , "" do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ?"
Emma Woodhouse	"yes , perfectly.-- Why do you make a doubt of it ? "" "" Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ? "" "" Never , never ! "" she cried with a most open eagerness--""Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them-- certain expressive looks , which I did not believe meant to be public . """
Emma Woodhouse	you amuse me excessively .
Emma Woodhouse	I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do-- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do .
Emma Woodhouse	He was dining with the Randalls family , and Jane , at the Eltons ' ; and he had seen a look , more than a single look , at Miss Fairfax , which , from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse , seemed somewhat out of place .
Emma Woodhouse	The Randalls party agreed to it immediately ; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates , which few persons listened to , she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse 's most obliging invitation .
Emma Woodhouse	That he might not be irritated into an absolute fever , by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse 's tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year , he soon afterwards took a hasty leave , and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey .
Emma Woodhouse	XVI The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst of all .
Emma Woodhouse	Every part of it brought pain and humiliation , of some sort or other ; but , compared with the evil to Harriet , all was light ; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken-- more in error -- more disgraced by mis - judgment , than she actually was , could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself .
Emma Woodhouse	""" If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man , I could have borne any thing ."
Emma Woodhouse	"He might have doubled his presumption to me-- but poor Harriet ! "" How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet -- never !"
Emma Woodhouse	She looked back as well as she could ; but it was all confusion .
Emma Woodhouse	She had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it .
Emma Woodhouse	His manners , however , must have been unmarked , wavering , dubious , or she could not have been so misled .
Emma Woodhouse	Certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet 's friend . To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility .
Emma Woodhouse	She remembered what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself . It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr. Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others . Contrary to the usual course of things , Mr. Elton 's wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion . His professions and his proposals did him no service .
Emma Woodhouse	She thought nothing of his attachment , and was insulted by his hopes .
Emma Woodhouse	He wanted to marry well , and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for .
Emma Woodhouse	Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance ; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions , or fancy any tone of voice , less allied with real love .
Emma Woodhouse	She need not trouble herself to pity him .
Emma Woodhouse	He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied , he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty , or with ten .
Emma Woodhouse	But -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ) , to marry him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!--look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!-- It was most provoking .
Emma Woodhouse	Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind .
Emma Woodhouse	The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior . He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family -- and that the Eltons were nobody . The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate , to which all the rest of Highbury belonged ; but their fortune , from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself , in every other kind of consequence ; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago , to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade , or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.-- But he had fancied her in love with him ; that evidently must have been his dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as ( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like Mr. Elton , in fancying himself a very decided favourite . If _ she _ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _ he _ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers .
Emma Woodhouse	The first error and the worst lay at her door .
Emma Woodhouse	"She was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more . "" Here have I , "" said she , "" actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man . She might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if I had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him . Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin .
Emma Woodhouse	There I was quite right .
Emma Woodhouse	That was well done of me ; but there I should have stopped , and left the rest to time and chance .
Emma Woodhouse	I was introducing her into good company , and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having ; I ought not to have attempted more .
Emma Woodhouse	I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _ not _ to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her;--William Coxe -- Oh !
Emma Woodhouse	"no , I could not endure William Coxe-- a pert young lawyer . """
Emma Woodhouse	She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be . The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet , and all that poor Harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully . To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma 's , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits .
Emma Woodhouse	, they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope . Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it . It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that Harriet 's nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive-- and that there could be no necessity for any body 's knowing what had passed except the three principals , and
Emma Woodhouse	The weather was most favourable for her ; though Christmas Day , she could not go to church .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas .
Emma Woodhouse	"The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton 's absenting himself . It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them,-- "" Ah !"
Emma Woodhouse	""" These days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions ; and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill - humour at Randalls , that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield . He was always agreeable and obliging , and speaking pleasantly of every body ."
Emma Woodhouse	But with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all the present comfort of delay , there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet , as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease .
Emma Woodhouse	IX Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles .
Emma Woodhouse	The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day ; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity . She must have delighted the Coles -- worthy people , who deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind her that would not soon die away . Perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy . She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax 's feelings to Frank Churchill .
Emma Woodhouse	her , and
Emma Woodhouse	his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue .
Emma Woodhouse	The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax ; and there she had no doubt .
Emma Woodhouse	She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing .
Emma Woodhouse	She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood -- and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half .
Emma Woodhouse	She was then interrupted by Harriet 's coming in ; and if Harriet 's praise could have satisfied her , she might soon have been comforted .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax ! "" "" Do n't class us together , Harriet ."
Emma Woodhouse	My playing is no more like her 's , than a lamp is like sunshine .
Emma Woodhouse	dear -- I think you play the best of the two .
Emma Woodhouse	"I think you play quite as well as she does . I am sure I had much rather hear you . Every body last night said how well you played . "" "" Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference ."
Emma Woodhouse	The truth is , Harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but Jane Fairfax 's is much beyond it .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out ."
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Cole said how much taste you had ; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution .
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her , though fearful of its producing Mr. Elton . """
Emma Woodhouse	I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer .
Emma Woodhouse	"Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him . "" "" Very likely.--I think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury . "" Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go with her ."
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet , tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word , was always very long at a purchase ; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind , Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;-- Mr. Perry walking hastily by , Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the office - door , Mr. Cole 's carriage - horses returning from exercise , or a stray letter - boy on an obstinate mule , were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect ; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray , a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket , two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone , and a string of dawdling children round the baker 's little bow - window eyeing the gingerbread , she knew she had no reason to complain , and was amused enough ; quite enough still to stand at the door .
Emma Woodhouse	She looked down the Randalls road .
Emma Woodhouse	The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs. Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury;--to Hartfield of course . They were stopping , however , in the first place at Mrs. Bates 's ; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford 's ; and had all but knocked , when Emma caught their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her ; and the agreeableness of yesterday 's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses , in order to hear the new instrument .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I am here on no business of my own , "" said Emma ; "" I am only waiting for my friend . She will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home ."
Emma Woodhouse	But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well -- if you advise it.--But ( with a smile ) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall I say ?"
Emma Woodhouse	I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston .
Emma Woodhouse	A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I do not believe any such thing , "" replied Emma.--""I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Do come with me , "" said Mrs. Weston , "" if it be not very disagreeable to you ."
Emma Woodhouse	I really wish you to call with me .
Emma Woodhouse	"and I always thought you meant it . "" He could say no more ; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates 's door ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma watched them in , and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern . At last it was all settled , even to the destination of the parcel .
Emma Woodhouse	How do you do , Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me , that I might be sure of succeeding .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are-- "" "" Very well , I am much obliged to you ."
Emma Woodhouse	then , said I , I must run across , I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in
Emma Woodhouse	; my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party , she can not refuse.--`Aye , pray do , ' said Mr. Frank Churchill , ` Miss Woodhouse 's opinion of the instrument will be worth having .
Emma Woodhouse	But , said I , I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--`Oh , ' said he , ` wait half a minute , till I have finished my job;'--For , would you believe it , Miss Woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother 's spectacles.--The rivet came out , you know , this morning.--
Emma Woodhouse	So very obliging!--For my mother had no use of her spectacles-- could not put them on .
Emma Woodhouse	I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know . At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping .
Emma Woodhouse	Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always -- I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them .
Emma Woodhouse	I dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off .
Emma Woodhouse	But about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry ; I happened to meet him in the street .
Emma Woodhouse	Not that I had any doubt before-- I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple .
Emma Woodhouse	I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome . We have apple - dumplings , however , very often .
Emma Woodhouse	Well , Mrs. Weston , you have prevailed , I hope , and these ladies will oblige us .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma would be "" very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates , & c. , "" and they did at last move out of the shop , with no farther delay from Miss Bates than , "" How do you do , Mrs. Ford ?"
Emma Woodhouse	I beg your pardon . I did not see you before .
Emma Woodhouse	I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town .
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma wondered on what , of all the medley , she would fix . """
Emma Woodhouse	Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing .
Emma Woodhouse	I do congratulate you , Mrs. Weston , most warmly .
Emma Woodhouse	` Oh ! ' said he , ` I can fasten the rivet .
Emma Woodhouse	I like a job of that sort excessively . ' I never shall forget his manner .
Emma Woodhouse	And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ` Oh ! ' said he directly , ` there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good , and these are the finest - looking home - baked apples I ever saw in my life . '
Emma Woodhouse	And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment .
Emma Woodhouse	He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- I believe there is two of them .
Emma Woodhouse	My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days .
Emma Woodhouse	But I was really quite shocked the other day-- for Mr. Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock .
Emma Woodhouse	So I begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same .
Emma Woodhouse	And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me --
Emma Woodhouse	No , I should not say quarrelled ,
Emma Woodhouse	for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could .
Emma Woodhouse	However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose .
Emma Woodhouse	I am always glad to see him . But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _ that _ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil .
Emma Woodhouse	He told Patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for Mrs. Hodges _ would _ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed !
Emma Woodhouse	I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world !
Emma Woodhouse	I wanted to keep it from Jane 's knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware .
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot .
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me .
Emma Woodhouse	My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping . She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same .
Emma Woodhouse	Then , if you please , you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's-- I do not know -- No , I think , Miss Woodhouse , I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield , and take it home with me at night .
Emma Woodhouse	"My dear Miss Woodhouse , "" said the latter , "" I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while , and give us your opinion of our new instrument ; you and Miss Smith ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are-- "" "" Very well , I am much obliged to you ."
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston told me you were here.-- Oh !
Emma Woodhouse	then , said I , I must run across , I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in
Emma Woodhouse	; my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party , she can not refuse.--`Aye , pray do , ' said Mr. Frank Churchill , ` Miss Woodhouse 's opinion of the instrument will be worth having .
Emma Woodhouse	But , said I , I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--`Oh , ' said he , ` wait half a minute , till I have finished my job;'--For , would you believe it , Miss Woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother 's spectacles.--The rivet came out , you know , this morning.--
Emma Woodhouse	I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know . At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping .
Emma Woodhouse	And it can not be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ? Only three of us.-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it .
Emma Woodhouse	` Oh ! ' said he , ` I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively . ' --Which you know shewed him to be so very . . . .
Emma Woodhouse	That , you know , was so very . . . .
Emma Woodhouse	Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times-- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it .
Emma Woodhouse	However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose .
Emma Woodhouse	William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master 's profit than any thing ; but Mrs. Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being
Emma Woodhouse	Pray take care , Miss Woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase-- rather darker and narrower than one could wish .
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot .
Emma Woodhouse	She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness ; and with this resemblance of her father , she inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in her own health , over - careful of that of her children , had many fears and many nerves , and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry . They were alike too , in a general benevolence of temper , and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. John Knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour .
Emma Woodhouse	He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing . He was not a great favourite with his fair sister - in - law .
Emma Woodhouse	She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella , which Isabella never felt herself .
Emma Woodhouse	Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella 's sister , but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of respectful forbearance towards her father . There he had not always the patience that could have been wished .
Emma Woodhouse	They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter 's attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last .
Emma Woodhouse	""" And do you see her , sir , tolerably often ? "" asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father ."
Emma Woodhouse	Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy .
Emma Woodhouse	I have been always telling you , my love , that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have Emma 's account , I hope you will be satisfied .
Emma Woodhouse	As for Isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Me , my love , "" cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part.-- "" Are you talking about me?--I"
Emma Woodhouse	am sure nobody ought to be , or can be , a greater advocate for matrimony than I am ; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield , I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world ; and as to slighting Mr. Weston , that excellent Mr. Weston , I think there is nothing he does not deserve .
Emma Woodhouse	Excepting yourself and your brother , I do not know his equal for temper .
Emma Woodhouse	I shall never forget his flying Henry 's kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o'clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham , I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him , it must be Miss Taylor .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not ? "" "" He has not been here yet , "" replied Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	"You forget how time passes . "" "" Three - and - twenty!--is he indeed?--Well , I could not have thought it-- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother !"
Emma Woodhouse	Well , time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad .
Emma Woodhouse	But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father !
Emma Woodhouse	I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with him .
Emma Woodhouse	""" But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Weston is rather an easy , cheerful - tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , I suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords . "" Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass ."
Emma Woodhouse	She would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all - sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother 's disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance .
Emma Woodhouse	"X One morning , about ten days after Mrs. Churchill 's decease , Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston , who "" could not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak with her . ""-- He met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father , "" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do , if it be possible . Mrs. Weston wants to see you ."
Emma Woodhouse	She must see you .
Emma Woodhouse	"She would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _ alone _ , and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come ? """
Emma Woodhouse	This moment , if you please .
Emma Woodhouse	It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way .
Emma Woodhouse	You will know it all in time .
Emma Woodhouse	To guess what all this meant , was impossible even for Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	Something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Now,""--said Emma , when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,-- "" now Mr. Weston , do let me know what has happened ."
Emma Woodhouse	She will break it to you better than I can .
Emma Woodhouse	"Do not be impatient , Emma ; it will all come out too soon . "" "" Break it to me , "" cried Emma , standing still with terror.-- "" Good God!--Mr . Weston , tell me at once.--Something has happened in Brunswick Square ."
Emma Woodhouse	I know it has .
Emma Woodhouse	Tell me , I charge you tell me this moment what it is .
Emma Woodhouse	"""-- "" Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I charge you by all that is sacred , not to attempt concealment . "" "" Upon my word , Emma . ""-- "" Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour , that it has nothing to do with any of them ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma 's courage returned , and she walked on ."
Emma Woodhouse	I should not have used the expression .
Emma Woodhouse	In fact , it does not concern you-- it concerns only myself,--that is , we hope.--Humph!--In short
Emma Woodhouse	, my dear Emma , there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort .
Emma Woodhouse	She asked no more questions therefore , merely employed her own fancy , and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern -- something just come to light , of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family,--something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward .
Emma Woodhouse	Her fancy was very active .
Emma Woodhouse	"Half a dozen natural children , perhaps -- and poor Frank cut off!-- This , though very undesirable , would be no matter of agony to her . It inspired little more than an animating curiosity . "" Who is that gentleman on horseback ? "" said she , as they proceeded-- speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view ."
Emma Woodhouse	You will not see him .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Has your son been with you , then ? "" "" Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	yes -- did not you know?--Well , well , never mind .
Emma Woodhouse	"They hurried on , and were speedily at Randalls.--""Well , my dear , "" said he , as they entered the room--""I have brought her , and now I hope you will soon be better ."
Emma Woodhouse	I shall leave you together .
Emma Woodhouse	"I shall not be far off , if you want me . ""-- And Emma distinctly heard him add , in a lower tone , before he quitted the room,--""I have been as good as my word . She has not the least idea . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Mrs. Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma 's uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said , "" What is it my dear friend ?"
Emma Woodhouse	It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Have you indeed no idea ? "" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Can not you , my dear Emma -- cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill , I do guess . "" """
Emma Woodhouse	You are right .
Emma Woodhouse	"It does relate to him , and I will tell you directly ; "" ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up . )"
Emma Woodhouse	Emma thought first of herself , and then of Harriet .
Emma Woodhouse	""" More than an attachment , indeed , "" resumed Mrs. Weston ; "" an engagement-- a positive engagement.--What will you say , Emma -- what will any body say , when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged;--nay , that they have been long engaged ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma even jumped with surprize;--and , horror - struck , exclaimed , "" Jane Fairfax!--Good God !"
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" You may well be amazed , "" returned Mrs. Weston , still averting her eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that Emma might have time to recover-- "" You may well be amazed ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her"
Emma Woodhouse	mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , "" said she at last , trying to recover herself ; "" this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day , before I can at all comprehend it ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me , Emma , very much . It has hurt his father equally ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma pondered a moment , and then replied , "" I will not pretend _ not _ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of . "" Mrs. Weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but Emma 's countenance was as steady as her words ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast , of my present perfect indifference , "" she continued , "" I will farther tell you , that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance , when I did like him , when I was very much disposed to be attached to him -- nay , was attached -- and how it came to cease , is perhaps the wonder ."
Emma Woodhouse	I have really for some time past , for at least these three months , cared nothing about him .
Emma Woodhouse	You may believe me , Mrs. Weston .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy ; and when she could find utterance , assured her , that this protestation had done"
Emma Woodhouse	", "" said she ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" On this point we have been wretched ."
Emma Woodhouse	"It was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other -- and we were persuaded that it was so.-- Imagine what we have been feeling on your account . "" "" I have escaped ; and that I should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself . But this does not acquit _ him _ , Mrs. Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame ."
Emma Woodhouse	"What right had he to endeavour to please , as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention , as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?-- How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?-- very wrong , very wrong indeed . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" From something that he said , my dear Emma , I rather imagine-- "" "" And how could _ she _ bear such behaviour !"
Emma Woodhouse	"Composure with a witness ! to look on , while repeated attentions were offering to another woman , before her face , and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity , which I can neither comprehend nor respect . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" There were misunderstandings between them , Emma ; he said so expressly ."
Emma Woodhouse	Much , much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him , I can not say how it has sunk him in my opinion . So unlike what a man should be!-- None of that upright integrity , that strict adherence to truth and principle , that disdain of trick and littleness , which a man should display in every transaction of his life .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Nay , dear Emma , now I must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , I have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and-- "" "" Good God ! "" cried Emma , not attending to her.--""Mrs . Smallridge , too !"
Emma Woodhouse	On this article I can fully acquit him .
Emma Woodhouse	"and it was the discovery of what she was doing , of this very project of hers , which determined him to come forward at once , own it all to his uncle , throw himself on his kindness , and , in short , put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long . "" Emma began to listen better . "" I am to hear from him soon , "" continued Mrs. Weston ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" _ His _ sufferings , "" replied Emma dryly , "" do not appear to have done him much harm ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Ah ! "" thought Emma , "" he would have done as much for Harriet . "" "" This was settled last night , and Frank was off with the light this morning ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells , the Dixons , did none of them know of the engagement ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush . "" None ; not one ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , "" said Emma , "" I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea , and I wish them very happy ."
Emma Woodhouse	But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding .
Emma Woodhouse	""" You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady . """
Emma Woodhouse	"His wife gave him a look which invited him in ; and , while he was coming round , added , "" Now , dearest Emma , let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease , and incline him to be satisfied with the match . Let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may"
Emma Woodhouse	""" If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax's.--Of such , one may almost say , that ` the world is not their 's , nor the world 's law . '"
Emma Woodhouse	""" She met Mr. Weston on his entrance , with a smiling countenance , exclaiming , "" A very pretty trick you have been playing me , upon my word !"
Emma Woodhouse	This was a device , I suppose , to sport with my curiosity , and exercise my talent of guessing .
Emma Woodhouse	I thought you had lost half your property , at least .
Emma Woodhouse	"And here , instead of its being a matter of condolence , it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I congratulate you , Mr. Weston , with all my heart , on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter . """
Emma Woodhouse	A glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate .
Emma Woodhouse	His air and voice recovered their usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand , and entered on the subject in a manner to prove , that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing . His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with Emma , in their walk back to Hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done .
Emma Woodhouse	XIV What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away .
Emma Woodhouse	They sat down to tea -- the same party round the same table-- how often it had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits , never in any thing like it ; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house , or even the attentive daughter .
Emma Woodhouse	As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them , Emma 's fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy . Her father -- and Harriet .
Emma Woodhouse	She could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims ; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost , was the question .
Emma Woodhouse	With respect to her father , it was a question soon answered .
Emma Woodhouse	She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father.--She even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .
Emma Woodhouse	While he lived , it must be only an engagement ; but she flattered herself , that if divested of the danger of drawing her away , it might become an increase of comfort to him.-- How to do her best by Harriet , was of more difficult decision;-- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain ; how to make her any possible atonement ; how to appear least her enemy?-- On these subjects , her perplexity and distress were very great-- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.-- She could only resolve at last , that she would still avoid a meeting with her , and communicate all that need be told by letter ; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury , and -- indulging in one scheme more-- nearly resolve , that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet ; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.-- She did not think it in Harriet 's nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety , by the streets , the shops , and the children.-- At any rate , it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself , from whom every thing was due ; a separation for the present ; an averting of the evil day , when they must all be together again .
Emma Woodhouse	She rose early , and wrote her letter to Harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that Mr. Knightley , in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before .
Emma Woodhouse	He had not left her long , by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else , when a letter was brought her from Randalls -- a very thick letter;--she guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity of reading it.-- She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill ; she wanted no explanations , she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself-- and as for understanding any thing he wrote , she was sure she was incapable of it.--It must be waded through , however .
Emma Woodhouse	She opened the packet ; it was too surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself , ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have the greatest pleasure , my dear Emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed . I know what thorough justice you will do it , and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.--I think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again ; but I will not delay you by a long preface.--We"
Emma Woodhouse	"This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday , but it was an ungenial morning ; and though you will never own being affected by weather , I think every body feels a north - east wind.-- I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning , but had the comfort of hearing last night , by Mr. Perry , that it had not made him ill . "" Yours ever , "" A. W. "" [ To Mrs. Weston . ] WINDSOR - JULY ."
Emma Woodhouse	", "" If I made myself intelligible yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected or not , I know it will be read with candour and indulgence.-- You are all goodness , and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.-- But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent . My courage rises while I write ."
Emma Woodhouse	It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble . I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon , that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.--You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls ; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards .
Emma Woodhouse	I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness .
Emma Woodhouse	If you need farther explanation , I have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband 's son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.--See me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to Randalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid .
Emma Woodhouse	You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury ; and as _ you _ were the person slighted , you will forgive me instantly ; but I must work on my father 's compassion , by reminding him , that so long as I absented myself from his house , so long I lost the blessing of knowing you .
Emma Woodhouse	My behaviour , during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you , did not , I hope , lay me open to reprehension , excepting on one point .
Emma Woodhouse	And now I come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation .
Emma Woodhouse	With the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think I ought to add , with the deepest humiliation.-- A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it ought.-- In order to assist a concealment so essential to me , I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.--I can not deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but I am sure you will believe the declaration , that had I not been convinced of her indifference , I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.-- Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish.--She
Emma Woodhouse	I remember her telling me at the ball , that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.-- I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss .
Emma Woodhouse	While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse , I could deserve nothing from either . Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to .
Emma Woodhouse	If you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account.-- Of the pianoforte so much talked of , I feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F-- , who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her.--
Emma Woodhouse	You will soon , I earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself.-- No description can describe her .
Emma Woodhouse	She must tell you herself what she is-- yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.--Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her.-- She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend .
Emma Woodhouse	I want to have your opinion of her looks .
Emma Woodhouse	I know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit . Perhaps it is paid already .
Emma Woodhouse	Let me hear from you without delay ; I am impatient for a thousand particulars .
Emma Woodhouse	You have not heard all that you ought to hear .
Emma Woodhouse	I could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult . , as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects
Emma Woodhouse	If I had followed her judgment , and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper , I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.-- Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There
Emma Woodhouse	I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to Miss W. , as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.-- In short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and I returned the same evening to Richmond , though I might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because I would be as angry with her as possible . Even then , I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but I was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and I went away determined that she should make the first advances.--I shall
Emma Woodhouse	always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party .
Emma Woodhouse	Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again .
Emma Woodhouse	Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls , she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton ; the whole system of whose treatment of her , by the bye , has ever filled me with indignation and hatred . I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known.-- ` Jane , ' indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you .
Emma Woodhouse	with a deep sigh , that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake?--No ; do not pity me till I reached Highbury , and saw how ill I had made her . Do not pity me till I saw her wan , sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone.--I was not disappointed ; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey .
Emma Woodhouse	But it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment 's uneasiness can ever occur between us again . Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before .
Emma Woodhouse	A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her.--If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve , I am quite of your opinion.--Miss
Emma Woodhouse	I hope she is right.--In one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL .
Emma Woodhouse	With the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think I ought to add , with the deepest humiliation.-- A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it ought.-- In order to assist a concealment so essential to me , I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.--I can not deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but I am sure you will believe the declaration , that had I not been convinced of her indifference , I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.-- Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish.--She
Emma Woodhouse	We seemed to understand each other . From our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , I can not say;--when I called to take leave of her , I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth , and I then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree.-- She may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part .
Emma Woodhouse	You will find , whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints , that it did not take her wholly by surprize . She frequently gave me hints of it .
Emma Woodhouse	I remember her telling me at the ball , that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.-- I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss .
Emma Woodhouse	While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse , I could deserve nothing from either . Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her . She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister 's marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .
Emma Woodhouse	Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .
Emma Woodhouse	Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse 's family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma . Between _ them _
Emma Woodhouse	Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor 's judgment , but directed chiefly by her own .
Emma Woodhouse	The real evils , indeed , of Emma 's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments . The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .
Emma Woodhouse	It was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance .
Emma Woodhouse	The wedding over , and the bride - people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening . Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning 's work for her .
Emma Woodhouse	She recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood .
Emma Woodhouse	A large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but
Emma Woodhouse	the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella 's marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection . She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault . How was she to bear the change?--It
Emma Woodhouse	was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house
Emma Woodhouse	with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .
Emma Woodhouse	She dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her . He could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful .
Emma Woodhouse	The evil of the actual disparity in their ages ( and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early ) was much increased by his constitution and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his life , without activity of mind or body , he was a much older man in ways than in years ; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not have recommended him at any time .
Emma Woodhouse	Her sister , though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled in London , only sixteen miles off , was much beyond her daily reach ; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield , before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband , and their little children , to fill the house , and give her pleasant society again
Emma Woodhouse	Highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which Hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals .
Emma Woodhouse	The Woodhouses were first in consequence there .
Emma Woodhouse	She had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day . It was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful . His spirits required support .
Emma Woodhouse	Randalls is such a distance .
Emma Woodhouse	"I could not walk half so far . "" "" No , papa , nobody thought of your walking ."
Emma Woodhouse	"We must go in the carriage , to be sure . "" "" The carriage !"
Emma Woodhouse	"But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ? """
Emma Woodhouse	We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night . And as for James , you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter 's being housemaid there .
Emma Woodhouse	That was your doing , papa .
Emma Woodhouse	You got Hannah that good place .
Emma Woodhouse	"Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her -- James is so obliged to you ! "" "" I am very glad I did think of her ."
Emma Woodhouse	It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her .
Emma Woodhouse	Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it .
Emma Woodhouse	It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast . I wanted them to put off the wedding .
Emma Woodhouse	How did you all behave ?
Emma Woodhouse	You do not think I could mean _ you _ , or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean _ you _ .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know-- in a joke -- it is all a joke .
Emma Woodhouse	my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass .
Emma Woodhouse	"Pray do not make any more matches . "" """
Emma Woodhouse	I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people .
Emma Woodhouse	And after such success , you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again . Oh dear , no !
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful-- Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone
Emma Woodhouse	Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him .
Emma Woodhouse	Your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage .
Emma Woodhouse	But if , which I rather imagine , your making the match , as you call it , means only your planning it , your saying to yourself one idle day , ` I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her , ' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards , why do you talk of success ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?-- I pity you.--I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck ."
Emma Woodhouse	And as to my poor word ` success , ' which you quarrel with , I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it .
Emma Woodhouse	You have drawn two pretty pictures ; but I think there may be a third -- a something between the do - nothing and the do - all .
Emma Woodhouse	If I had not promoted Mr. Weston 's visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all .
Emma Woodhouse	""" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns ."
Emma Woodhouse	"You are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference . "" "" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others , "" rejoined Mr. Woodhouse , understanding but in part ."
Emma Woodhouse	[ Emma by Jane Austen 1816 ] VOLUME I
Emma Woodhouse	XV This letter must make its way to Emma 's feelings . She was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold .
Emma Woodhouse	As soon as she came to her own name , it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself , by the natural return of her former regard for the writer , and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at
Emma Woodhouse	She never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong
Emma Woodhouse	, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever .
Emma Woodhouse	She thought so well of the letter , that when Mr. Knightley came again , she desired him to read it .
Emma Woodhouse	She was sure of Mrs. Weston 's wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr. Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Weston was to call in the evening , and she must return it by him .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I would rather be talking to you , "" he replied ; "" but as it seems a matter of justice , it shall be done . """
Emma Woodhouse	"He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , "" Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman 's letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference . "" He proceeded a little farther , reading to himself ; and then , with a smile , observed , "" Humph !"
Emma Woodhouse	By doing it , I shall feel that I am near you .
Emma Woodhouse	"It will not be so great a loss of time : but if you dislike it-- "" "" Not at all ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I should wish it . """
Emma Woodhouse	"he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here . "" "" And I have not forgotten , "" said Emma , "" how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I was not quite impartial in my judgment , Emma:--but yet , I think-- had _ you _ not been in the case -- I should still have distrusted him ."
Emma Woodhouse	Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.-- No judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his own wishes , and regardless of little besides his own convenience.-- Fancying you to have fathomed his secret . Natural enough!-- his own mind full of intrigue , that he should suspect it in others.--Mystery ; Finesse -- how they pervert the understanding !
Emma Woodhouse	My Emma , does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other ?
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet 's account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of . """
Emma Woodhouse	"You had better go on , "" said she ."
Emma Woodhouse	"A boyish scheme , indeed!--I can not comprehend a man 's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with ; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument 's coming if she could . """
Emma Woodhouse	"You never wrote a truer line . "" And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax 's sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , "" This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could . He should have respected even unreasonable scruples , had there been such ; but hers were all reasonable . We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment . "" Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party , and grew uncomfortable ."
Emma Woodhouse	Her own behaviour had been so very improper !
Emma Woodhouse	She was deeply ashamed , and a little afraid of his next look .
Emma Woodhouse	It was all read , however , steadily , attentively , and without the smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving pain -- no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Nay , nay , read on.--You will find how very much he suffers . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge 's children-- a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's -- a neighbour of Maple Grove ; and , by the bye , I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Say nothing , my dear Emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of Mrs. Elton . Only one page more ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him . "" "" Well , there _ is _ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill.--Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her ."
Emma Woodhouse	That was your name for him , was it ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am ; but still you must , at least I hope you must , think the better of him for it ."
Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	And now , let me talk to you of something else .
Emma Woodhouse	Ever since I left you this morning , Emma , my mind has been hard at work on one subject .
Emma Woodhouse	"The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father . Emma 's answer was ready at the first word . "" While her dear father lived , any change of condition must be impossible for her ."
Emma Woodhouse	"She could never quit him . """
Emma Woodhouse	The impossibility of her quitting her father , Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to .
Emma Woodhouse	He had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father 's comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded .
Emma Woodhouse	But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as her father 's happiness in other words his life -- required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise .
Emma Woodhouse	Of their all removing to Donwell , Emma had already had her own passing thoughts .
Emma Woodhouse	Like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her .
Emma Woodhouse	She was sensible of all the affection it evinced . She felt that , in quitting Donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with .
Emma Woodhouse	She promised to think of it , and advised him to think of it more ; but he was fully convinced , that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject .
Emma Woodhouse	He had given it , he could assure her , very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning , to have his thoughts to himself .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am sure William Larkins will not like it ."
Emma Woodhouse	You must get his consent before you ask mine .
Emma Woodhouse	""" She promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it , with the intention of finding it a very good scheme . It is remarkable , that Emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded ."
Emma Woodhouse	Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley 's marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of
Emma Woodhouse	This proposal of his , this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield-- the more she contemplated it , the more pleasing it became .
Emma Woodhouse	His evils seemed to lessen , her own advantages to increase , their mutual good to outweigh every drawback .
Emma Woodhouse	Such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!-- Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy !
Emma Woodhouse	She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield .
Emma Woodhouse	The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself , poor Harriet must , in mere charitable caution , be kept at a distance from .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment .
Emma Woodhouse	""" When he came to Miss Woodhouse , he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud -- all that related to her , with a smile ; a look ; a shake of the head ; a word or two of assent , or disapprobation ; or merely of love , as the subject required ; concluding , however , seriously , and , after steady reflection , thus-- "" Very bad -- though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous game ."
Emma Woodhouse	` Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune . '--Those were Miss Woodhouse 's words , were they?-- And a fine ending -- and there is the letter .
Emma Woodhouse	"XI "" Harriet , poor Harriet!""--Those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her . Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself -- very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _ his _ behaviour as her _ own _ , which made her so angry with him ."
Emma Woodhouse	It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet 's account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet ! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery .
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , "" Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith . ""--She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet 's imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments ."
Emma Woodhouse	Her influence would have been enough . And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been risking her friend 's happiness on most insufficient grounds .
Emma Woodhouse	"Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet , that she must not allow herself to think of him , and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--""But , with common sense , "" she added , "" I am afraid I have had little to do . """
Emma Woodhouse	She was extremely angry with herself .
Emma Woodhouse	If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful.-- As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account .
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous.-- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted .
Emma Woodhouse	She understood it all ; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings , she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert . But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge !
Emma Woodhouse	There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else . Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first . Considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet 's mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would.-- She must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible . An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston 's parting words .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma had promised ; but still Harriet must be excepted .
Emma Woodhouse	It was her superior duty .
Emma Woodhouse	In spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet , which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself .
Emma Woodhouse	The intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another . Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet 's footstep and voice ; so , she supposed , had poor Mrs. Weston felt when _ she _ was approaching Randalls .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , Miss Woodhouse ! "" cried Harriet , coming eagerly into the room-- "" is not this the oddest news that ever was ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" What news do you mean ? "" replied Emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint ."
Emma Woodhouse	Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for Mr. Weston has told me himself .
Emma Woodhouse	I met him just now .
Emma Woodhouse	He told me it was to be a great secret ; and , therefore , I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you , but he said you knew it .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" What did Mr. Weston tell you?""--said Emma , still perplexed ."
Emma Woodhouse	he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while .
Emma Woodhouse	""" It was , indeed , so odd ; Harriet 's behaviour was so extremely odd , that Emma did not know how to understand it . Her character appeared"
Emma Woodhouse	Emma looked at her , quite unable to speak .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Had you any idea , "" cried Harriet , "" of his being in love with her?--You , perhaps , might.--You ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body 's heart ; but nobody else--"
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Upon my word , "" said Emma , "" I begin to doubt my having any such talent ."
Emma Woodhouse	Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly-- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr. Frank Churchill 's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax . You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Why should you caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill . "" "" I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject , "" replied Emma , smiling ; "" but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Harriet ! "" cried Emma , after a moment 's pause--""What do you mean?--"
Emma Woodhouse	"Good Heaven ! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?-- "" She could not speak another word.--Her"
Emma Woodhouse	voice was lost ; and she
Emma Woodhouse	sat down , waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer .
Emma Woodhouse	"Harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma 's . "" I should not have thought it possible , "" she began , "" that you could have misunderstood me ! I know we agreed never to name him-- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else , I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person . Mr. Frank Churchill , indeed !"
Emma Woodhouse	And that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing!--I am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him .
Emma Woodhouse	"But if _ you _ , who had been always acquainted with him-- "" "" Harriet ! "" cried Emma , collecting herself resolutely--""Let us understand each other now , without the possibility of farther mistake ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Not quite , "" returned Emma , with forced calmness , "" for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person ."
Emma Woodhouse	I could almost assert that you had _ named _ Mr. Frank Churchill .
Emma Woodhouse	I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , was spoken of .
Emma Woodhouse	My dear Harriet , I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion .
Emma Woodhouse	I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh , dear , "" cried Harriet , "" now I recollect what you mean ; but I was thinking of something very different at the time ."
Emma Woodhouse	No !
Emma Woodhouse	""" Good God ! "" cried Emma , "" this has been a most unfortunate-- most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ?"
Emma Woodhouse	Emma could not speak .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do not wonder , Miss Woodhouse , "" she resumed , "" that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body ."
Emma Woodhouse	You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other .
Emma Woodhouse	But I hope , Miss Woodhouse , that supposing -- that if-- strange as it may appear-- . But you know they were your own words , that _ more _ wonderful things had happened , matches of _ greater _ disparity had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me ; and , therefore , it seems as if such a thing even as this , may have occurred before-- and
Emma Woodhouse	"if I should be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to-- if Mr. Knightley should really -- if _ he _ does not mind the disparity , I hope , dear Miss Woodhouse , you will not set yourself against it , and try to put difficulties in the way . But you are too good for that , I am sure . "" Harriet was standing at one of the windows ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said , "" Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley 's returning your affection ? "" "" Yes , "" replied Harriet modestly , but not fearfully--""I must say that I have . "" Emma 's eyes were instantly withdrawn ; and she sat silently meditating , in a fixed attitude , for a few minutes ."
Emma Woodhouse	A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart .
Emma Woodhouse	A mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress .
Emma Woodhouse	She touched-- she admitted -- she acknowledged the whole truth .
Emma Woodhouse	It darted through her , with the speed of an arrow , that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself !
Emma Woodhouse	Her own conduct , as well as her own heart , was before her in the same few minutes . She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before .
Emma Woodhouse	How improperly had she been acting by Harriet !
Emma Woodhouse	How inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct ! What blindness , what madness , had led her on !
Emma Woodhouse	It struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world .
Emma Woodhouse	Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits-- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _ compassion _ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now , ) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet 's hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right.-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost.-- Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves . Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight.--Emma 's tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet 's , but they were not less .
Emma Woodhouse	Her voice was not unsteady ; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self , such a burst of threatening evil , such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions , must create.-- She listened with much inward suffering , but with great outward patience , to
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet 's detail.--Methodical , or well arranged , or very well delivered , it could not be expected to be ; but it contained , when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration , a substance to sink her spirit-- especially with the corroborating circumstances , which her own memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley 's most improved opinion of Harriet .
Emma Woodhouse	Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation . From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse 's encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it . When they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her . Emma knew it to have been very much the case .
Emma Woodhouse	She had often observed the change , to almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him-- and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet . He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings.--
Emma Woodhouse	She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet 's memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma .
Emma Woodhouse	Circumstances that might swell to half an hour 's relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush . )
Emma Woodhouse	He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged.-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming:-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _ her _ .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Might he not?--Is not it possible , that when enquiring , as you thought , into the state of your affections , he might be alluding to Mr. Martin-- he might have Mr. Martin 's interest in view ?"
Emma Woodhouse	"But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . "" The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech , the many bitter feelings , made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma 's side , to enable her to say on reply , "" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . "" Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father 's footsteps . He was coming through the hall . Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" She could not compose herself-- Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go;""--with most ready encouragement from her friend , therefore , she passed off through another door -- and the moment she was gone , this was the spontaneous burst of Emma 's feelings : "" Oh God ! that I had never seen her ! """
Emma Woodhouse	The rest of the day , the following night , were hardly enough for her thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours .
Emma Woodhouse	Every moment had brought a fresh surprize ; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her.--How to understand it all !
Emma Woodhouse	How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself , and living under!--The blunders , the blindness of her own head and heart!--she sat still , she walked about , she tried her own room , she tried the shrubbery -- in every place , every posture , she perceived that she had acted most weakly ; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree ; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying ; that she was wretched , and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness . To understand , thoroughly understand her own heart , was the first endeavour .
Emma Woodhouse	To that point went every leisure moment which her father 's claims on her allowed , and every moment of involuntary absence of mind .
Emma Woodhouse	How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her , as every feeling declared him now to be ?
Emma Woodhouse	When had his influence , such influence begun?-- When had he succeeded to that place in her affection , which Frank Churchill had once , for a short period , occupied?--She
Emma Woodhouse	; she compared the two -- compared them , as they had always stood in her estimation , from the time of the latter 's becoming known to her-- and as they must at any time have been compared by her , had it-- oh ! had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear . She saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all ! This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection .
Emma Woodhouse	This was the knowledge of herself , on the first question of inquiry , which she reached ; and without being long in reaching it.-- She was most sorrowfully indignant ; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for Mr. Knightley.-- Every other part of her mind was disgusting . With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body 's feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body 's destiny .
Emma Woodhouse	She was proved to have been universally mistaken ; and she had not quite done nothing -- for she had done mischief . She had brought evil on Harriet , on herself , and she too much feared , on
Emma Woodhouse	to take place , on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning ; for his attachment , she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet's;--and even were this not the case , he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly .
Emma Woodhouse	Such a debasement on his !
Emma Woodhouse	It was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion , to foresee the smiles , the sneers , the merriment it would prompt at his expense ; the mortification and disdain of his brother , the thousand inconveniences to himself.--Could it be?--No
Emma Woodhouse	Though now the middle of December , there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; and on the morrow , Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family , who lived a little way out of Highbury .
Emma Woodhouse	Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane , a lane leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular , main street of the place ; and , as may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of Mr. Elton .
Emma Woodhouse	A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed , and then , about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage , an old and not very good house , almost as close to the road as it could be .
Emma Woodhouse	"It had no advantage of situation ; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor ; and , such as it was , there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes.--Emma 's remark was-- "" There it is ."
Emma Woodhouse	There go you and your riddle - book one of these days .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Harriet , she found , had never in her life been within side the Vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , Emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with Mr. Elton 's seeing ready wit in her ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I wish we could contrive it , "" said she ; "" but I can not think of any tolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father"
Emma Woodhouse	.
Emma Woodhouse	"After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again-- "" I do so wonder , Miss Woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married ! so charming as you are!""-- Emma laughed , and replied , "" My being charming , Harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; I must find other people charming -- one other person at least ."
Emma Woodhouse	"And I am not only , not going to be married , at present , but have very little intention of ever marrying at all . "" "" Ah!--so you say ; but I can not believe it ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet , to be tempted ; Mr. Elton , you know , ( recollecting herself , ) is out of the question : and I do _ not _ wish to see any such person ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!""-- "" I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry ."
Emma Woodhouse	but I never have been in love ; it is not my way , or my nature ; and I do not think I ever shall .
Emma Woodhouse	And , without love , I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine .
Emma Woodhouse	Fortune I do not want ; employment I do not want ; consequence I do not want : I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband 's house as I am of Hartfield ; and never , never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man 's eyes as I am in my father 's .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" But then , to be an old maid at last , like Miss Bates ! "" "" That is as formidable an image as you could present , Harriet ; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates !"
Emma Woodhouse	so silly -- so satisfied-- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious-- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , I would marry to - morrow .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Never mind , Harriet , I shall not be a poor old maid ; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public ! A single woman , with a very narrow income , must be a ridiculous , disagreeable old maid ! the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else ."
Emma Woodhouse	Those who can barely live , and who live perforce in a very small , and generally very inferior , society , may well be illiberal and cross .
Emma Woodhouse	"This does not apply , however , to Miss Bates ; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me ; but , in general , she is very much to the taste of every body , though single and though poor . Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind : I really believe , if she had only a shilling in the world , she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it ; and nobody is afraid of her : that is a great charm . "" "" Dear me !"
Emma Woodhouse	"how shall you employ yourself when you grow old ? "" """
Emma Woodhouse	If I know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty .
Emma Woodhouse	Woman 's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now ; or with no important variation . If I draw less , I shall read more ; if I give up music , I shall take to carpet - work .
Emma Woodhouse	And as for objects of interest , objects for the affections , which is in truth the great point of inferiority , the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in _ not _ marrying , I shall be very well off , with all the children of a sister I love so much , to care about .
Emma Woodhouse	There will be enough of them , in all probability , to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need .
Emma Woodhouse	"There will be enough for every hope and every fear ; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent , it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder . My nephews and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me . "" "" Do you know Miss Bates 's niece ?"
Emma Woodhouse	"That is , I know you must have seen her a hundred times -- but are you acquainted ? """
Emma Woodhouse	yes ; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury .
Emma Woodhouse	By the bye , _ that _ is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece .
Emma Woodhouse	Heaven forbid !
Emma Woodhouse	at least , that I should ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together , as she does about Jane Fairfax .
Emma Woodhouse	One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax .
Emma Woodhouse	Every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was very compassionate ; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness , her counsel and her patience , as from her purse .
Emma Woodhouse	"She understood their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little ; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good - will . In the present instance , it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit ; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice , she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet , as they walked away , "" These are the sights , Harriet , to do one good ."
Emma Woodhouse	"How trifling they make every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day ; and yet , who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Very true , "" said Harriet ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" And really , I do not think the impression will soon be over , "" said Emma , as she crossed the low hedge , and tottering footstep which ended the narrow , slippery path through the cottage garden , and brought them into the lane again . "" I do not think it will , "" stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place , and recall the still greater within ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	They walked on .
Emma Woodhouse	"The lane made a slight bend ; and when that bend was passed , Mr. Elton was immediately in sight ; and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther , "" Ah !"
Emma Woodhouse	Well , ( smiling , ) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important .
Emma Woodhouse	If we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Harriet could just answer , "" Oh ! dear , yes , "" before the gentleman joined them ."
Emma Woodhouse	The wants and sufferings of the poor family , however , were the first subject on meeting .
Emma Woodhouse	He had been going to call on them .
Emma Woodhouse	His visit he would now defer ; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done . Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them .
Emma Woodhouse	""" To fall in with each other on such an errand as this , "" thought Emma ; "" to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring a great increase of love on each side ."
Emma Woodhouse	I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration .
Emma Woodhouse	"I wish I were anywhere else . """
Emma Woodhouse	Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could , she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath , a little raised on one side of the lane , leaving them together in the main road .
Emma Woodhouse	But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet 's habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too , and that , in short , they would both be soon after her .
Emma Woodhouse	This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute . They did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield . To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her . She gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child 's pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them .
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Elton was speaking with animation , Harriet listening with a very pleased attention ; and Emma , having sent the child on , was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more , when they both looked around , and she was obliged to join them .
Emma Woodhouse	"Mr. Elton was still talking , still engaged in some interesting detail ; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday 's party at his friend Cole 's , and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese , the north Wiltshire , the butter , the cellery , the beet - root , and all the dessert . "" This would soon have led to something better , of course , "" was her consoling reflection ; "" any thing interests between those who love ; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart ."
Emma Woodhouse	They now walked on together quietly , till within view of the vicarage pales , when a sudden resolution , of at least getting Harriet into the house , made her again find something very much amiss about her boot , and fall behind to arrange it once more .
Emma Woodhouse	She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort .
Emma Woodhouse	"I really am a most troublesome companion to you both , but I hope I am not often so ill - equipped . Mr. Elton , I must beg leave to stop at your house , and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string , or any thing just to keep my boot on . """
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage . The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner . She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it .
Emma Woodhouse	It was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room . For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself .
Emma Woodhouse	It could be protracted no longer . She was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance . The lovers were standing together at one of the windows . It had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully . But it would not do ; he had not come to the point . He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Cautious , very cautious , "" thought Emma ; "" he advances inch by inch , and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event ."
Emma Woodhouse	There go you and your riddle - book one of these days .
Emma Woodhouse	"After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again-- "" I do so wonder , Miss Woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married ! so charming as you are!""-- Emma laughed , and replied , "" My being charming , Harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; I must find other people charming -- one other person at least ."

The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner .

Emma Woodhouse	XII One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma -- its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill 's stay in Surry ; for , in spite of Mr. Weston 's confidence , she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight .
Emma Woodhouse	But this was not judged feasible . The preparations must take their time , nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on , and for a few days they must be planning , proceeding and hoping in uncertainty -- at the risk-- in her opinion , the great risk , of its being all in vain .
Emma Woodhouse	All was safe and prosperous ; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another , Emma , being now certain of her ball , began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley 's provoking indifference about it .
Emma Woodhouse	"To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply , than , "" Very well ."
Emma Woodhouse	If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.-- Oh !
Emma Woodhouse	yes , I must be there ; I could not refuse ; and I will keep as much awake as I can ; but I would rather be at home , looking over William Larkins 's week 's account ;
Emma Woodhouse	much rather , I confess.-- Pleasure in seeing dancing!--not I , indeed -- I never look at it-- I do not know who does.--Fine dancing , I believe , like virtue , must be its own reward .
Emma Woodhouse	"Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different . "" This Emma felt was aimed at her ; and it made her quite angry ."
Emma Woodhouse	It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent , or so indignant ; he was not guided by _ her _ feelings in reprobating the ball , for _ she _ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree .
Emma Woodhouse	"It made her animated -- open hearted-- she voluntarily said;-- "" Oh !"
Emma Woodhouse	Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball .
Emma Woodhouse	"I do look forward to it , I own , with _ very _ great pleasure . """
Emma Woodhouse	No!--she was more and more convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise .
Emma Woodhouse	The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma , in a note from Mrs. Weston , instantly .
Emma Woodhouse	"Mrs. Weston added , "" that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon . "" This wretched note was the finale of Emma 's breakfast . When once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim . The loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man-- and all that the young man might be feeling!--It"
Emma Woodhouse	"Such a delightful evening as it would have been!--Every body so happy ! and she and her partner the happiest!--""I said it would be so , "" was the only consolation ."
Emma Woodhouse	Her father 's feelings were quite distinct .
Emma Woodhouse	He thought principally of Mrs. Churchill 's illness , and wanted to know how she was treated ; and as for the ball , it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed ; but they would all be safer at home .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" But you will come again , "" said Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	My father depends on it .
Emma Woodhouse	"Do not forget your engagement . "" Emma looked graciously ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" As you do us such ample justice now , "" said Emma , laughing , "" I will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ?"
Emma Woodhouse	I am sure we do .
Emma Woodhouse	"I am sure you did not much expect to like us . You would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury . """
Emma Woodhouse	He laughed rather consciously ; and though denying the sentiment , Emma was convinced that it had been so .
Emma Woodhouse	"My regard for Hartfield is most warm""-- He stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed.-- He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ?"
Emma Woodhouse	Short had been the notice -- short their meeting ; he was gone ; and Emma
Emma Woodhouse	To complete every other recommendation , he had _ almost _ told her that he loved her .
Emma Woodhouse	What strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to , was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration , a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion , joined to all the rest , made her think that she _ must _ be a little in love with him , in spite of every previous determination against it .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I certainly must , "" said she ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing 's being dull and insipid about the house!-- I must be in love ; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not -- for a few weeks at least ."
Emma Woodhouse	I shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball , if not for Frank Churchill ; but Mr. Knightley will be happy .
Emma Woodhouse	""" You , Emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck ! """
Emma Woodhouse	It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax , to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change ; but when they did meet , her composure was odious .
Emma Woodhouse	She had been particularly unwell , however , suffering from headache to a degree , which made her aunt declare , that had the ball taken place , she did not think Jane could have attended it ; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill - health .
Emma Woodhouse	"He had no reason to wish his hair longer , to conceal any confusion of face ; no reason to wish the money unspent , to improve his spirits . He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever ; and , after seeing him , Emma thus moralised to herself:-- "" I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way ."
Emma Woodhouse	There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.--No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly .
Emma Woodhouse	""" With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; of judging of his general manners , and by inference , of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be , who were now seeing them together for the first time ."
Emma Woodhouse	She meant to be very happy , in spite of the scene being laid at Mr. Cole 's ; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr. Elton , even in the days of his favour , none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole .
Emma Woodhouse	Her father 's comfort was amply secured , Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs. Goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it .
Emma Woodhouse	She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole 's door ; and was pleased to see that it was Mr. Knightley 's ; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses , having little spare money and a great deal of health , activity , and independence , was too apt , in Emma 's opinion , to get about as he could , and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey . She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart , for he stopped to hand her out .
Emma Woodhouse	""" This is coming as you should do , "" said she ; "" like a gentleman.-- I am quite glad to see you . "" He thanked her , observing , "" How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment !"
Emma Woodhouse	"if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.-- You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes I should , I am sure I should ."
Emma Woodhouse	You think you carry it off very well , I dare say , but with you it is a sort of bravado , an air of affected unconcern
Emma Woodhouse	; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances .
Emma Woodhouse	_ Now _ you have nothing to try for .
Emma Woodhouse	You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed .
Emma Woodhouse	You are not striving to look taller than any body else .
Emma Woodhouse	_ Now _ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr. Knightley .
Emma Woodhouse	She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please , and given all the consequence she could wish for .
Emma Woodhouse	When the Westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , the strongest of admiration were for her , from both husband and wife ; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and , as she firmly believed , not without some dexterity on his side . The party was rather large , as it included one other family , a proper unobjectionable country family , whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part of Mr. Cox 's family , the lawyer of Highbury .
Emma Woodhouse	The less worthy females were to come in the evening , with Miss Bates , Miss Fairfax , and Miss Smith ; but already , at dinner , they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general ; and , while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over , Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour .
Emma Woodhouse	The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of Jane Fairfax .
Emma Woodhouse	That very dear part of Emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates , and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte -- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand , but a large - sized square pianoforte ; and the substance of the story , the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations on her side , and explanations on Miss Bates 's , was , that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood 's the day before , to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at first , by Miss Bates 's account , Jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it-- but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell .
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her ; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell , and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made ; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way , and still listen to Mrs. Cole .
Emma Woodhouse	""" You may _ say _ what you chuse -- but your countenance testifies that your _ thoughts _ on this subject are very much like mine . """
Emma Woodhouse	I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve .
Emma Woodhouse	I smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; but at present I do not see what there is to question .
Emma Woodhouse	It is Mrs. Dixon , I dare say .
Emma Woodhouse	I told you that your suspicions would guide mine .
Emma Woodhouse	""" If so , you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _ Mr _ . Dixon in them . "" "" Mr. Dixon.--Very well ."
Emma Woodhouse	"We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance . "" "" Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I can not help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend ,"
Emma Woodhouse	I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are .
Emma Woodhouse	"I was there -- one of the party . "" "" Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there , I think I should have made some discoveries . "" """
Emma Woodhouse	I dare say you would ; but I , simple I , saw nothing but the fact , that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her.--It
Emma Woodhouse	And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again-- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable .
Emma Woodhouse	"I do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries . "" The conversation was here interrupted . They were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses , and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others ; but when the table was again safely covered , when every corner dish was placed exactly right , and occupation and ease were generally restored , Emma said , "" The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me ."
Emma Woodhouse	I wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough .
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , I am sure it is not from the Campbells ."
Emma Woodhouse	I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business .
Emma Woodhouse	At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world .
Emma Woodhouse	"But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . "" There was no occasion to press the matter farther . The conviction seemed real ; he looked as if he felt it . She said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes . The ladies had not been long in the drawing - room , before the other ladies , in their different divisions , arrived ."
Emma Woodhouse	Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend ; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace , she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner , but could most heartily rejoice in that light , cheerful , unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure , in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection . There she sat -- and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding ?
Emma Woodhouse	To be in company , nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed , to sit and smile and look pretty , and say nothing , was enough for the happiness of the present hour .
Emma Woodhouse	"Jane Fairfax did look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend . In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her . She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte , she felt too much in the secret herself , to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair , and therefore purposely kept at a distance ; but by the others , the subject was almost immediately introduced , and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received , the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of "" my excellent friend Colonel Campbell . """
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston , kind - hearted and musical , was particularly interested by the circumstance , and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine 's countenance .
Emma Woodhouse	In he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece , made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle , where sat Miss Woodhouse ; and till he could find a seat by her , would not sit at all .
Emma Woodhouse	Emma divined what every body present must be thinking .
Emma Woodhouse	She was his object , and every body must perceive it .
Emma Woodhouse	"She introduced him to her friend , Miss Smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other . "" He had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naivete ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" And she , "" Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton . "" Emma restrained her indignation , and only turned from her in silence ."
Emma Woodhouse	Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax ; but it was most prudent to avoid speech .
Emma Woodhouse	He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining - room-- hated sitting long -- was always the first to move when he could-- that his father , Mr. Knightley , Mr. Cox , and Mr. Cole , were left very busy over parish business -- that as long as he had staid , however , it had been pleasant enough , as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike , sensible men ; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether -- thought it so abundant in agreeable families-- that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much . She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire-- the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as Enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and
Emma Woodhouse	She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy , and that Highbury , taken at its best , might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked .
Emma Woodhouse	The unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father .
Emma Woodhouse	"I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen . "" The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to Mr. Cole . When Mr. Cole had moved away , and her attention could be restored as before , she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax , who was sitting exactly opposite ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" What is the matter ? "" said she ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Thank you for rousing me , "" he replied ."
Emma Woodhouse	"Yes , I will -- I declare I will -- and you shall see how she takes it;-- whether she colours . """
Emma Woodhouse	He was gone immediately ; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of Miss Fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing . Before he could return to his chair , it was taken by Mrs. Weston .
Emma Woodhouse	My dear Emma , I am longing to talk to you .
Emma Woodhouse	I have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and I must tell them while the idea is fresh .
Emma Woodhouse	Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here ?
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" They walked , I conclude ."
Emma Woodhouse	I was quite surprized;--very glad , I am sure ; but really quite surprized . Such a very kind attention -- and so thoughtful an attention!-- the sort of thing that so few men would think of .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Very likely , "" said Emma--""nothing more likely ."
Emma Woodhouse	I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent .
Emma Woodhouse	He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax 's ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley .
Emma Woodhouse	I know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , "" said Mrs. Weston , smiling , "" you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again . The more I think of it , the more probable it appears ."
Emma Woodhouse	"See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to it ? "" "" Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax ! "" exclaimed Emma ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Dear Mrs. Weston , how could you think of such a thing?--Mr . Knightley!--Mr . Knightley must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--"
Emma Woodhouse	I can not at all consent to Mr. Knightley 's marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely .
Emma Woodhouse	"I am amazed that you should think of such a thing . "" "" My dear Emma , I have told you what led me to think of it ."
Emma Woodhouse	"I do not want the match -- I do not want to injure dear little Henry-- but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry 's account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ? "" "" Yes , I would ."
Emma Woodhouse	I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.-- Mr. Knightley marry!--No , I have never had such an idea , and I can not adopt it now .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know . "" "" But the imprudence of such a match ! "" "" I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" I see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention ."
Emma Woodhouse	His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses .
Emma Woodhouse	He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax-- and is always glad to shew them attention .
Emma Woodhouse	My dear Mrs. Weston , do not take to match - making .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" My dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax-- "" "" Nonsense !"
Emma Woodhouse	In the way of love , I am sure he does not .
Emma Woodhouse	"` Not that it was such a very old petticoat either -- for still it would last a great while -- and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong . ' "" "" For shame , Emma ! Do not mimic her . You divert me against my conscience . And , upon my word , I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates ."
Emma Woodhouse	But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does .
Emma Woodhouse	I have heard him speak , and so must you , so very highly of Jane Fairfax !
Emma Woodhouse	I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice !
Emma Woodhouse	I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever . Oh !
Emma Woodhouse	and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody-- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr. Knightley ?
Emma Woodhouse	I can not help suspecting him .
Emma Woodhouse	"I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love . "" "" Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love ."
Emma Woodhouse	But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so . "" "" There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma . I have a very strong notion that it comes from him ."
Emma Woodhouse	They combated the point some time longer in the same way ; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend ; for Mrs. Weston was the most used of the two to yield ; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over , and the instrument in preparation;-- and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it .
Emma Woodhouse	Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr. Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .
Emma Woodhouse	She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well . One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize -- a second , slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill . Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song , and every thing usual followed .
Emma Woodhouse	They sang together once more ; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own .
Emma Woodhouse	With mixed feelings , she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument , to listen .
Emma Woodhouse	But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half Emma 's mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs. Weston 's suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions .
Emma Woodhouse	Her objections to Mr. Knightley 's marrying did not in the least subside .
Emma Woodhouse	She could see nothing but evil in it . It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley ; consequently to Isabella .
Emma Woodhouse	A real injury to the children -- a most mortifying change , and material loss to them all;--a very great deduction from her father 's daily comfort -- and , as to herself , she could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey . A Mrs. Knightley for them all to give way to!--No -- Mr. Knightley must never marry .
Emma Woodhouse	Presently Mr. Knightley looked back , and came and sat down by her .
Emma Woodhouse	They talked at first only of the performance . His admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for Mrs. Weston , it would not have struck her .
Emma Woodhouse	As a sort of touchstone , however , she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece ; and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short , she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own .
Emma Woodhouse	""" I often feel concern , "" said she , "" that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions . It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Quite out of the question , quite out of the question , "" he replied;-- "" but you must often wish it , I am sure . """
Emma Woodhouse	And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step .
Emma Woodhouse	""" This present from the Campbells , "" said she--""this pianoforte is very kindly given ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" From that moment , Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument . But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a little longer doubtful ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" That will do , "" said he , when it was finished , thinking aloud-- "" you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet . "" Another song , however , was soon begged for ."
Emma Woodhouse	"And Frank Churchill was heard to say , "" I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling ."
Emma Woodhouse	"And touching Miss Bates , who at that moment passed near--""Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ?"
Emma Woodhouse	"They have no mercy on her . """
Emma Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top .
Emma Woodhouse	While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off , Emma found time , in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste , to look about , and see what became of Mr. Knightley .
Emma Woodhouse	No ; he was talking to Mrs. Cole-- he was looking on unconcerned ; Jane was asked by somebody else , and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole . Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry ; his interest was yet safe ; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment .
Emma Woodhouse	Not more than five couple could be mustered ; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful , and she found herself well matched in a partner .
Emma Woodhouse	"After some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston , look sorrowful , and have done . "" Perhaps it is as well , "" said Frank Churchill , as he attended Emma to her carriage ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence ; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole 's , turned to Frank Churchill ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Why do you smile ? "" said she ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" Nay , why do you ?"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell 's being so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I rather wonder that it was never made before . "" "" Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before . "" "" Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument-- which must now be shut up in London , untouched by any body . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do not know ."
Emma Woodhouse	I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve .
Emma Woodhouse	I smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; but at present I do not see what there is to question .
Emma Woodhouse	I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon .
Emma Woodhouse	Yes , I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon .
Emma Woodhouse	""" And , upon my word , they have an air of great probability ."
Emma Woodhouse	Mr. Dixon 's preference of her music to her friend 's , I can answer for being very decided .
Emma Woodhouse	""" Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced ."
Emma Woodhouse	Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely .
Emma Woodhouse	At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world .
Emma Woodhouse	"But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . "" There was no occasion to press the matter farther . The conviction seemed real ; he looked as if he felt it . She said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes . The ladies had not been long in the drawing - room , before the other ladies , in their different divisions , arrived ."
Emma Woodhouse	In he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece , made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle , where sat Miss Woodhouse ; and till he could find a seat by her , would not sit at all .
Emma Woodhouse	I can not at all consent to Mr. Knightley 's marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely .
Emma Woodhouse	For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing .
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" Imprudent , if you please -- but not mad . Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable . "" "" But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry ."
Emma Woodhouse	""" "" You take up an idea , Mrs. Weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . I see no sign of attachment-- I believe nothing of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax . """
Emma Woodhouse	Here ceased the concert part of the evening , for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers ; but soon ( within five minutes ) the proposal of dancing-- originating nobody exactly knew where -- was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole , that every thing was rapidly clearing away , to give proper space .
Augusta Elton	XV Emma was not required , by any subsequent discovery , to retract her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton . Her observation had been pretty correct .
Augusta Elton	Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview , such she appeared whenever they met again,--self - important , presuming , familiar , ignorant , and ill - bred .
Augusta Elton	She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs. Elton 's consequence only could surpass .
Augusta Elton	There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently from his wife . He seemed not merely happy with her , but proud .
Augusta Elton	"He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury , as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of Miss Bates 's good - will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that Mrs. Elton 's praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being "" very pleasant and very elegantly dressed . """
Augusta Elton	In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first .
Augusta Elton	Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended , probably , by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with , she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant ; and though the effect was agreeable , the ill - will which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma 's dislike .
Augusta Elton	Her manners , too -- and Mr. Elton 's , were unpleasant towards Harriet .
Augusta Elton	was not to be doubted that poor Harriet 's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve , and her own share in the story , under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him , had in all likelihood been given also . She was , of course , the object of their joint dislike.-- When they had nothing else to say , it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse ; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her , found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet .
Augusta Elton	Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax ; and from the first .
Augusta Elton	"Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other , but from the very first ; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration-- but without solicitation , or plea , or privilege , she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence , and about the third time of their meeting , she heard all Mrs. Elton 's knight - errantry on the subject.-- "" Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents . I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well ."
Augusta Elton	I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point .
Augusta Elton	You will laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--
Augusta Elton	Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet , ` Full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ` And waste its fragrance on the desert air . '
Augusta Elton	"Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me!-- But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman 's tongue ! """
Augusta Elton	The change on Mrs. Elton 's side soon afterwards appeared , and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs. Elton , nor , under Mrs. Elton 's guidance , the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax , and only sharing with others in a general way , in knowing what was felt , what was meditated , what was done .
Augusta Elton	Bates 's gratitude for Mrs. Elton 's attentions to Jane
Augusta Elton	She was quite one of her worthies-- the most amiable , affable , delightful woman -- just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered .
Augusta Elton	Emma 's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do .
Augusta Elton	And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton 's notice and the penury of her conversation , rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real , generous affection .
Augusta Elton	"But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle . "" Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject , before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton , Mrs. Weston ventured this apology for Jane ."
Augusta Elton	"We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to . "" "" You are right , Mrs. Weston , "" said Mr. Knightley warmly , "" Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton ."
Augusta Elton	Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her .
Augusta Elton	"But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton , which nobody else pays her . """
Augusta Elton	"With a faint blush , she presently replied , "" Such attentions as Mrs. Elton 's , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax ."
Augusta Elton	"Mrs. Elton 's invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting . "" "" I should not wonder , "" said Mrs. Weston , "" if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt 's eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton 's civilities for her ."
Augusta Elton	very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change .
Augusta Elton	"Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said , "" Another thing must be taken into consideration too -- Mrs. Elton does not talk _ to _ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _ of _ her . We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other-- a something more early implanted . We can not give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before . We feel things differently . And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to . Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton 's way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness . "" "" I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax , "" said Emma ."
Augusta Elton	""" Yes , "" he replied , "" any body may know how highly I think of her ."
Augusta Elton	""" And yet , "" said Emma , beginning hastily and with an arch look , but soon stopping -- it was better , however , to know the worst at once-- she hurried on--""And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is ."
Augusta Elton	I wonder how she speaks of the Coles-- what she calls them !
Augusta Elton	How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ?
Augusta Elton	She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do for Mr. Cole ? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . Mrs. Weston , your argument weighs most with me . I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax 's mind over Mrs. Elton . I have no faith in Mrs. Elton 's acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding .
Augusta Elton	I can not imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau .
Augusta Elton	"It would be a _ secret _ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate . She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.-- The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name.-- She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , "" Beg her to walk up;""--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging ."
Augusta Elton	"There was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.-- She came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone , "" This is most kind , indeed!--Miss Woodhouse , it is impossible for me to express -- I hope you will believe -- Excuse me for being so entirely without words . "" Emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of Mrs. Elton 's voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand ."
Augusta Elton	Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together .
Augusta Elton	Emma could have wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere ; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body ; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness ,
Augusta Elton	she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm .
Augusta Elton	She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton 's thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits
Augusta Elton	"When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs. Weston , she found herself abruptly addressed with , "" Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit?--(here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane ."
Augusta Elton	"Upon my word , Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!-- Oh ! if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst!""-- And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma , whispered farther , "" We do not say a word of any _ assistance _ that Perry might have ; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh ! no ; Perry shall have all the credit ."
Augusta Elton	Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane 's prospects-- that is , I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--
Augusta Elton	"How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.-- Such a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes , indeed.-- Charming young man!--that is -- so very friendly ; I mean good Mr. Perry!-- such attention to Jane!""--And from her great , her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there , Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane , from the vicarage quarter , which was now graciously overcome.-- After a few whispers , indeed , which placed it beyond a guess , Mrs. Elton , speaking louder , said , "" Yes , here I am , my good friend ; and here I have been so long , that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that I am waiting for my lord and master . He promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you ."
Augusta Elton	for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr. Elton 's time is so engaged .
Augusta Elton	""" Upon my word it is , Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning to night.--There is no end of people 's coming to him , on some pretence or other.--The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion ."
Augusta Elton	"They seem not able to do any thing without him.--`Upon my word , Mr. E. , ' I often say , ` rather you than I.-- I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if I had half so many applicants . '--Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.--However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all . "" And putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma--""A congratulatory visit , you know.--Oh ! yes , quite indispensable . "" Miss Bates looked about her , so happily!-- "" He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley ; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.--Mr"
Augusta Elton	"Emma would not have smiled for the world , and only said , "" Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk . """
Augusta Elton	Weston and Cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way
Augusta Elton	""" Upon my word , my dear , I do not know , for I never heard the subject talked of ."
Augusta Elton	""" But it is proved by the smallness of the school , which I have heard you speak of , as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge ; the only school , and not more than five - and - twenty children . "" "" Ah !"
Augusta Elton	clever creature , that 's very true .
Augusta Elton	I say , Jane , what a perfect character you and I should make , if we could be shaken together .
Augusta Elton	"My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate , however , that _ some _ people may not think _ you _ perfection already.--But hush!-- not a word , if you please . """
Augusta Elton	It seemed an unnecessary caution ; Jane was wanting to give her words , not to Mrs. Elton , but to Miss Woodhouse , as the latter plainly saw .
Augusta Elton	"The wish of distinguishing her , as far as civility permitted , was very evident , though it could not often proceed beyond a look . Mr. Elton made his appearance . His lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity . "" Very pretty , sir , upon my word ; to send me on here , to be an encumbrance to my friends , so long before you vouchsafe to come!-- But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with . You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.-- Here have I been sitting this hour , giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience -- for who can say , you know , how soon it may be wanted ? """
Augusta Elton	Mr. Elton was so hot and tired , that all this wit seemed thrown away .
Augusta Elton	"His civilities to the other ladies must be paid ; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering , and the walk he had had for nothing . """
Augusta Elton	"When I got to Donwell , "" said he , "" Knightley could not be found ."
Augusta Elton	"after the note I sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one . """
Augusta Elton	""" Donwell ! "" cried his wife.--""My dear Mr. E. , you have not been to Donwell!--You"
Augusta Elton	mean the Crown ; you come from the meeting at the Crown .
Augusta Elton	"I can not imagine , "" said Mrs. Elton , ( feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do , ) "" I can not imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world !"
Augusta Elton	The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E. , he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;-- and his servants forgot it .
Augusta Elton	""" "" I met William Larkins , "" continued Mr. Elton , "" as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him.--William"
Augusta Elton	"I have nothing to do with William 's wants , but it really is of very great importance that _ I _ should see Knightley to - day ; and it becomes a matter , therefore , of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose . """
Augusta Elton	In all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr. Elton , if not towards William Larkins .
Augusta Elton	""" Oh ! "" cried Jane , with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure--""there would have been no danger ."
Augusta Elton	"But , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend-- "" "" Oh ! you are too scrupulous , indeed you are , "" cried Emma warmly , and taking her hand . "" You owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even-- "" "" You are very kind , but I know what my manners were to you.--"
Augusta Elton	""" Pray say no more . I feel that all the apologies should be on my side ."
Augusta Elton	Let us forgive each other at once . We must do whatever is to be done quickest , and I think our feelings will lose no time there .
Augusta Elton	I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor ?
Augusta Elton	""" And the next news , I suppose , will be , that we are to lose you-- just as I begin to know you . "" "" Oh !"
Augusta Elton	"The smile was returned as Jane answered , "" You are very right ; it has been thought of ."
Augusta Elton	And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ) , that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled .
Augusta Elton	There must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for .
Augusta Elton	""" Thank you , thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured of.-- Oh !"
Augusta Elton	"if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!-- Good - bye , good - bye . """
Augusta Elton	Mrs. Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all . Emma had feelings , less of curiosity than of pride or propriety , to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects ; and she made a point of Harriet 's going with her , that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible . She could not enter the house again , could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to lace up her boot , without _ recollecting _ .
Augusta Elton	"The visit was of course short ; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it , that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady , and on no account to give one , beyond the nothing - meaning terms of being "" elegantly dressed , and very pleasing . """
Augusta Elton	She did not really like her .
Augusta Elton	She would not be in a hurry to find fault , but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease , but not elegance.-- She was almost sure that for a young woman , a stranger , a bride , there was too much ease . Her person was rather good ; her face not unpretty ; but neither feature , nor air , nor voice , nor manner , were elegant . Emma thought at least it would turn out so .
Augusta Elton	As for Mr. Elton , his manners did not appear -- but no , she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners .
Augusta Elton	"The woman was better off ; she might have the assistance of fine clothes , and the privilege of bashfulness , but the man had only his own good sense to depend on ; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married , the woman he had wanted to marry , and the woman whom he had been expected to marry , she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise , and to be as much affectedly , and as little really easy as could be . "" Well , Miss Woodhouse , "" said Harriet , when they had quitted the house , and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ;"
Augusta Elton	""" Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh , ) what do you think of her?-- Is not she very charming ?"
Augusta Elton	yes -- very -- a very pleasing young woman .
Augusta Elton	""" I think her beautiful , quite beautiful . "" "" Very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown . "" "" I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love . """
Augusta Elton	""" Oh ! no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune ; and she came in his way . """
Augusta Elton	""" I dare say , "" returned Harriet , sighing again , "" I dare say she was very much attached to him . "" "" Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man 's fate to marry the woman who loves him best . Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have . "" "" Yes , "" said Harriet earnestly , "" and well she might , nobody could ever have a better ."
Augusta Elton	And now , Miss Woodhouse , I do not think I shall mind seeing them again .
Augusta Elton	He is just as superior as ever;--but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing .
Augusta Elton	No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery .
Augusta Elton	To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort!-- She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves .
Augusta Elton	Happy creature !
Augusta Elton	"He called her ` Augusta . ' How delightful ! "" When the visit was returned , Emma made up her mind . She could then see more and judge better ."
Augusta Elton	From Harriet 's happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father 's being present to engage Mr. Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady 's conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good . Harriet would have been a better match .
Augusta Elton	If not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set .
Augusta Elton	The rich brother - in - law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance , and his place and his carriages were the pride of him .
Augusta Elton	Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room , the entrance , and all that she could see or imagine .
Augusta Elton	""" Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at Maple Grove ; her sister 's favourite room ."
Augusta Elton	"Mr. Elton was appealed to.--""Was not it astonishingly like?-- She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove . """
Augusta Elton	""" And the staircase -- You know , as I came in , I observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house ."
Augusta Elton	I really could not help exclaiming !
Augusta Elton	I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove .
Augusta Elton	I have spent so many happy months there ! ( with a little sigh of sentiment ) .
Augusta Elton	Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home . Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind .
Augusta Elton	"I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony . """
Augusta Elton	Emma made as slight a reply as she could ; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs. Elton , who only wanted to be talking herself .
Augusta Elton	And it is not merely the house-- the grounds , I assure you , as far as I could observe , are strikingly like .
Augusta Elton	The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way -- just across the lawn ; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind ! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place .
Augusta Elton	"She had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else ; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double - dyed , and therefore only said in reply , "" When you have seen more of this country , I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield ."
Augusta Elton	It is the garden of England , you know .
Augusta Elton	"Many counties , I believe , are called the garden of England , as well as Surry . "" "" No , I fancy not , "" replied Mrs. Elton , with a most satisfied smile ."
Augusta Elton	"I never heard any county but Surry called so . """
Augusta Elton	""" My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest , "" continued Mrs. Elton ; "" and that will be our time for exploring ."
Augusta Elton	While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say .
Augusta Elton	They would hardly come in their chaise , I think , at that season of the year .
Augusta Elton	Indeed , when the time draws on , I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable . When people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring . We explored to King's - Weston twice last summer , in that way , most delightfully , just after their first having the barouche - landau .
Augusta Elton	"You have many parties of that kind here , I suppose , Miss Woodhouse , every summer ? "" "" No ; not immediately here . We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure ."
Augusta Elton	Many a time has Selina said , when she has been going to Bristol , ` I really can not get this girl to move from the house .
Augusta Elton	I absolutely must go in by myself , though I hate being stuck up in the barouche - landau without a companion ; but Augusta , I believe , with her own good - will , would never stir beyond the park paling . '
Augusta Elton	Many a time has she said so ; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion .
Augusta Elton	I think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little . I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse-- ( looking towards Mr. Woodhouse ) , Your father 's state of health must be a great drawback .
Augusta Elton	Let me recommend Bath to you .
Augusta Elton	"I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good . "" "" My father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr. Perry , whose name , I dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now . "" "" Ah !"
Augusta Elton	that 's a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give .
Augusta Elton	And it is so cheerful a place , that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse 's spirits , which , I understand , are sometimes much depressed . And as to its recommendations to _ you _ , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them .
Augusta Elton	It would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place .
Augusta Elton	"A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , Mrs. Partridge , the lady I have always resided with when in Bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with . "" It was as much as Emma could bear , without being impolite ."
Augusta Elton	The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an _ introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs. Elton's -- probably some vulgar , dashing widow , who , with the help of a boarder , just made a shift to live!-- The dignity of Miss Woodhouse , of Hartfield , was sunk indeed !
Augusta Elton	"She restrained herself , however , from any of the reproofs she could have given , and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly ; "" but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father ."
Augusta Elton	I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs. Elton .
Augusta Elton	"Upon these occasions , a lady 's character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer . """
Augusta Elton	A superior performer!--very far from it , I assure you .
Augusta Elton	Consider from how partial a quarter your information came .
Augusta Elton	I am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _ mediocre _ to the last degree . You , Miss Woodhouse , I well know , play delightfully . I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into .
Augusta Elton	""" We can not suppose , "" said Emma , smiling , "" that Mr. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _ very _ musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive ."
Augusta Elton	I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours . Will not it be a good plan ?
Augusta Elton	Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _ me _ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know-- there is a sad story against them , in general .
Augusta Elton	""" "" But you , who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger , surely ?"
Augusta Elton	""" I should hope not ; but really when I look around among my acquaintance , I tremble ."
Augusta Elton	And the same may be said of Mrs. Jeffereys -- Clara Partridge , that was -- and of the two Milmans , now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper ; and of more than I can enumerate .
Augusta Elton	"Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright . I used to be quite angry with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention . I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper . "" "" But every thing of that kind , "" said Emma , "" will soon be in so regular a train-- "" "" Well , "" said Mrs. Elton , laughing , "" we shall see . """
Augusta Elton	Emma , finding her so determined upon neglecting her music , had nothing more to say ; and , after a moment 's pause , Mrs. Elton chose another subject .
Augusta Elton	""" We have been calling at Randalls , "" said she , "" and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be ."
Augusta Elton	I like them extremely .
Augusta Elton	Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature-- quite a first - rate favourite with me already , I assure you .
Augusta Elton	And _ she _ appears so truly good -- there is something so motherly and kind - hearted about her , that it wins upon one directly .
Augusta Elton	"She was your governess , I think ? """
Augusta Elton	Emma was almost too much astonished to answer ; but Mrs. Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on .
Augusta Elton	""" Having understood as much , I was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like !"
Augusta Elton	"But she is really quite the gentlewoman . """
Augusta Elton	""" Mrs. Weston 's manners , "" said Emma , "" were always particularly good ."
Augusta Elton	"Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman . "" "" And who do you think came in while we were there ? "" Emma was quite at a loss . The tone implied some old acquaintance-- and how could she possibly guess ? "" Knightley ! "" continued Mrs. Elton ; "" Knightley himself!--Was not it lucky?--for , not being within when he called the other day , I had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr. E. 's , I had a great curiosity ."
Augusta Elton	` My friend Knightley ' had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend .
Augusta Elton	I like him very much .
Augusta Elton	Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman - like man .
Augusta Elton	""" Insufferable woman ! "" was her immediate exclamation ."
Augusta Elton	""" Worse than I had supposed ."
Augusta Elton	Knightley!--I could not have believed it .
Augusta Elton	Knightley!--never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman !
Augusta Elton	A little upstart , vulgar being , with her Mr. E. , and her _ caro _ _ sposo _ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery .
Augusta Elton	I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady .
Augusta Elton	And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club !
Augusta Elton	And Mrs. Weston!-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman ! Worse and worse .
Augusta Elton	I never met with her equal .
Augusta Elton	""" Well , my dear , "" he deliberately began , "" considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you ."
Augusta Elton	She speaks a little too quick .
Augusta Elton	But I believe I am nice ; I do not like strange voices ; and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor .
Augusta Elton	However , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife . Though I think he had better not have married .
Augusta Elton	I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion ; I said that I hoped I _ should _ in the course of the summer . But I ought to have gone before .
Augusta Elton	""" "" I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir ."
Augusta Elton	"Mr. Elton knows you . """
Augusta Elton	""" But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _ bride _ ? It ought to be no recommendation to _ you _ ."
Augusta Elton	And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies .
Augusta Elton	""" My dear , you do not understand me ."
Augusta Elton	Her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _ her _ . Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton 's offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her .
Augusta Elton	Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed .
Augusta Elton	Her introductions and recommendations must all wait , and every projected party be still only talked of .
Augusta Elton	So she thought at first;--but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off .
Augusta Elton	This was so very well understood between them , that Emma could not but feel some surprise , and a little displeasure , on hearing from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton , as her brother and sister had failed her , that the two parties should unite , and go together ; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it , so it was to be , if she had no objection .
Augusta Elton	Now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton , of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton 's party !
Augusta Elton	And she is a good - natured woman after all .
Augusta Elton	One could not leave her out .
Augusta Elton	It was now the middle of June , and the weather fine ; and Mrs. Elton was growing impatient to name the day , and settle with Mr. Weston as to pigeon - pies and cold lamb , when a lame carriage - horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty .
Augusta Elton	Mrs. Elton 's resources were inadequate to such an attack .
Augusta Elton	""" Is not this most vexations , Knightley ? "" she cried.--""And such weather for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious ."
Augusta Elton	What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done . Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston .
Augusta Elton	She promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it .
Augusta Elton	""" You may depend upon me , "" said she ."
Augusta Elton	""" I certainly will come ."
Augusta Elton	Name your day , and I will come .
Augusta Elton	"You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax ? "" "" I can not name a day , "" said he , "" till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you ."
Augusta Elton	leave all that to me .
Augusta Elton	Only give me a carte - blanche.--I am Lady Patroness , you know .
Augusta Elton	It is my party .
Augusta Elton	I will bring friends with me .
Augusta Elton	""" I hope you will bring Elton , "" said he : "" but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations . "" "" Oh !"
Augusta Elton	now you are looking very sly .
Augusta Elton	But consider -- you need not be afraid of delegating power to _ me _ .
Augusta Elton	I am no young lady on her preferment .
Augusta Elton	Married women , you know , may be safely authorised .
Augusta Elton	It is my party .
Augusta Elton	Leave it all to me .
Augusta Elton	I will invite your guests .
Augusta Elton	""" No,""--he calmly replied,--""there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one is-- "" "" --Mrs . Weston , I suppose , "" interrupted Mrs. Elton , rather mortified . "" No -- Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself . "" "" Ah !"
Augusta Elton	"you are an odd creature ! "" she cried , satisfied to have no one preferred to herself.--""You"
Augusta Elton	are a humourist , and may say what you like .
Augusta Elton	Well , I shall bring Jane with me-- Jane and her aunt.--The rest I leave to you .
Augusta Elton	I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family .
Augusta Elton	I know you are attached to them .
Augusta Elton	""" You certainly will meet them if I can prevail ; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home . """
Augusta Elton	""" That 's quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every day:--but as you like ."
Augusta Elton	I shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm .
Augusta Elton	My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room .
Augusta Elton	The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , I think is best observed by meals within doors .
Augusta Elton	And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?-- Pray be sincere , Knightley .
Augusta Elton	"If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges , or to inspect anything-- "" "" I have not the least wish for it , I thank you ."
Augusta Elton	""" Well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever . "" """
Augusta Elton	I will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body 's assistance .
Augusta Elton	""" "" I wish we had a donkey ."
Augusta Elton	The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me -- and my caro sposo walking by .
Augusta Elton	"I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;--and very long walks , you know -- in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt . """
Augusta Elton	I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible .
Augusta Elton	""" "" That I am sure you would ."
Augusta Elton	Indeed I do you justice , my good friend .
Augusta Elton	Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart .
Augusta Elton	"As I tell Mr. E. , you are a thorough humourist.-- Yes , believe me , Knightley , I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme . You have hit upon the very thing to please me . """
Augusta Elton	He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton , and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma 's , and Harriet 's going there some very fine morning .
Augusta Elton	The invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like Mrs. Elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and Mr. Weston , unasked , promised to get Frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--
Augusta Elton	"She had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush . These were pleasant feelings , and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did , and collect round the strawberry - beds.--The whole party were assembled , excepting Frank Churchill , who was expected every moment from Richmond ; and Mrs. Elton , in all her apparatus of happiness , her large bonnet and her basket , was very ready to lead the way in gathering , accepting , or talking -- strawberries , and only strawberries , could now be thought or spoken of.--""The best fruit in England-- every body 's favourite -- always wholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one 's self -- the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time -- never tired-- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison-- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce --"
Augusta Elton	""" Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy.-- She had some fears of his horse . Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.-- A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question ."
Augusta Elton	Mrs. Elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures .
Augusta Elton	: it was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge , an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling , a lady known at Maple Grove .
Augusta Elton	Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend 's negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.-- Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow 's post.--How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma.--She
Augusta Elton	""" "" Certainly , if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone ? "" "" Yes -- what should hurt me?--I walk fast ."
Augusta Elton	"I shall be at home in twenty minutes . "" "" But it is too far , indeed it is , to be walking quite alone ."
Augusta Elton	""" Thank you , thank you -- but on no account.--I would rather walk.-- And for _ me _ to be afraid of walking alone!--I , who may so soon have to guard others ! "" She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , "" That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now ."
Augusta Elton	"The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already . "" """
Augusta Elton	"I am,""--she answered--""I am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits ."
Augusta Elton	Mine , I confess , are exhausted .
Augusta Elton	"The greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that I am gone when it is necessary . "" Emma had not another word to oppose ."
Augusta Elton	She saw it all ; and entering into her feelings , promoted her quitting the house immediately ,
Augusta Elton	and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend .
Augusta Elton	"And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more I shall like you . "" Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St. Mark 's Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room ."
Augusta Elton	""" "" You are sick of prosperity and indulgence ."
Augusta Elton	"Can not you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ? "" "" _ I _ sick of prosperity and indulgence !"
Augusta Elton	I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged .
Augusta Elton	I am thwarted in every thing material .
Augusta Elton	"I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person . "" "" You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came ."
Augusta Elton	Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well .
Augusta Elton	Another slice of cold meat , another draught of Madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us .
Augusta Elton	""" "" No -- I shall not stir ."
Augusta Elton	I shall sit by you .
Augusta Elton	"You are my best cure . "" "" We are going to Box Hill to - morrow;--you will join us ."
Augusta Elton	You will stay , and go with us ?
Augusta Elton	""" No , certainly not ; I shall go home in the cool of the evening ."
Augusta Elton	""" But you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning ."
Augusta Elton	If I come , I shall be cross .
Augusta Elton	""" Then pray stay at Richmond . "" "" But if I do , I shall be crosser still ."
Augusta Elton	"I can never bear to think of you all there without me . "" "" These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself ."
Augusta Elton	Chuse your own degree of crossness .
Augusta Elton	I shall press you no more .
Augusta Elton	XVII When the ladies returned to the drawing - room after dinner , Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;-- with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself .
Augusta Elton	She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together .
Augusta Elton	Mrs. Elton left them no choice .
Augusta Elton	If Jane repressed her for a little time , she soon began again ; and though much that passed between them was in a half - whisper , especially on Mrs. Elton 's side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects :
Augusta Elton	"The post - office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship , were long under discussion ; and to them succeeded one , which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , and professions of Mrs. Elton 's meditated activity . "" Here is April come ! "" said she , "" I get quite anxious about you ."
Augusta Elton	"my dear , we can not begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing . """
Augusta Elton	""" I not aware ! "" said Jane , shaking her head ; "" dear Mrs. Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ?"
Augusta Elton	""" But you have not seen so much of the world as I have . You do not know how many candidates there always are for the _ first _ situations ."
Augusta Elton	I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove .
Augusta Elton	Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge 's is the one I would most wish to see you in .
Augusta Elton	aye , I know your scruples .
Augusta Elton	You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am .
Augusta Elton	"I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible . """
Augusta Elton	""" Thank you , but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , I do not wish to be giving any body trouble . """
Augusta Elton	""" But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us ."
Augusta Elton	Your inexperience really amuses me !
Augusta Elton	"A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment 's notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly . "" "" Excuse me , ma'am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends ."
Augusta Elton	my dear , human flesh !
Augusta Elton	"You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition . "" "" I did not mean , I was not thinking of the slave - trade , "" replied Jane ; "" governess - trade , I assure you , was all that I had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , I do not know where it lies ."
Augusta Elton	""" Something that would do ! "" repeated Mrs. Elton ."
Augusta Elton	""" Aye , _ that _ may suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life ."
Augusta Elton	""" You are very obliging ; but as to all that , I am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , I think , would only be the greater ; I should suffer more from comparison ."
Augusta Elton	"A gentleman 's family is all that I should condition for . "" "" I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle ."
Augusta Elton	Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is -- I do not know-- if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play;--yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest .
Augusta Elton	""" You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together , "" said Jane , "" they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs. Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer ."
Augusta Elton	""" "" And I am quite serious too , I assure you , "" replied Mrs. Elton gaily , "" in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us ."
Augusta Elton	""" In this style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room ; her vanity had then a change of object , and Emma heard her saying in the same half - whisper to Jane , "" Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest!--Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature he is;--I assure you I like him excessively . I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me ."
Augusta Elton	But this good old Mr. Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner .
Augusta Elton	I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous .
Augusta Elton	I fancy I am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown .
Augusta Elton	How do you like it?--Selina 's choice -- handsome , I think , but I do not know whether it is not over - trimmed ; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed -- quite a horror of finery .
Augusta Elton	I must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me .
Augusta Elton	A bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery . But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery are every thing .
Augusta Elton	I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin .
Augusta Elton	This is precisely what I wanted . Well , pretty good news , is not it ?
Augusta Elton	Have you finished it ?
Augusta Elton	"Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now . I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way . "" Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion ."
Augusta Elton	They were the first entitled , after Mrs. Weston and Emma , to be made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her .
Augusta Elton	XVI Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton , was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage .
Augusta Elton	Dinner - parties and evening - parties were made for him and his lady ; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day .
Augusta Elton	"He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her . "" This is very true , "" said she , "" at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--"
Augusta Elton	Mrs. Elton , as elegant as lace and pearls could make her , he looked at in silence-- wanting only to observe enough for Isabella 's information -- but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl , and he could talk to her . He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys , when it had been just beginning to rain .
Augusta Elton	Miss Bates said a great deal ; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse 's presiding ; Mr. Knightley 's answer was the most distinct .
Augusta Elton	""" "" It is a sort of thing , "" cried Mrs. Elton emphatically , "" which _ I _ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into ."
Augusta Elton	"Though , perhaps , as the _ Chaperon _ of the party-- _ I _ never was in any circle -- exploring parties -- young ladies -- married women-- "" Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband ; and he murmured , in reply , "" Very true , my love , very true ."
Augusta Elton	"Every body knows what is due to _ you _ . "" "" It will not do , "" whispered Frank to Emma ; "" they are most of them affronted ."
Augusta Elton	That will just do for me , you know .
Augusta Elton	"for myself , I protest I must be excused , "" said Mrs. Elton"
Augusta Elton	"; "" _ I _ really can not attempt -- I am not at all fond of the sort of thing ."
Augusta Elton	I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with .
Augusta Elton	I knew who it came from .
Augusta Elton	An abominable puppy!-- You know who I mean ( nodding to her husband ) .
Augusta Elton	These kind of things are very well at Christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer .
Augusta Elton	""" Yes , yes , pray pass _ me _ , "" added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; "" _ I _ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse , or any other young lady ."
Augusta Elton	Jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off .
Augusta Elton	"You , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _ some _ , ) would be entirely guided by _ your _ treatment of her.--This is not pleasant to you , Emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but I must , I will,--I will tell you truths while I can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now . """
Augusta Elton	I remember her telling me at the ball , that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.-- I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss .
Jane Fairfax	Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax ; and from the first .
Jane Fairfax	"Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other , but from the very first ; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration-- but without solicitation , or plea , or privilege , she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence , and about the third time of their meeting , she heard all Mrs. Elton 's knight - errantry on the subject.-- "" Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents . I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well ."
Jane Fairfax	she is absolutely charming !
Jane Fairfax	You will laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--
Jane Fairfax	And her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her .
Jane Fairfax	We must bring her forward .
Jane Fairfax	We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" I can not think there is any danger of it , "" was Emma 's calm answer-- "" and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax 's situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown . "" "" Oh !"
Jane Fairfax	Miss Woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end !
Jane Fairfax	And I think she feels it .
Jane Fairfax	I am sure she does . She is very timid and silent .
Jane Fairfax	One can see that she feels the want of encouragement .
Jane Fairfax	I like her the better for it .
Jane Fairfax	"I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express . "" """
Jane Fairfax	"You appear to feel a great deal -- but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax 's acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than""-- "" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act ."
Jane Fairfax	_ We _ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _ we _ live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient.--I
Jane Fairfax	should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _ more _ than Jane Fairfax to partake of it .
Jane Fairfax	Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be-- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr. Suckling , in income.--However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation .
Jane Fairfax	My acquaintance is so very extensive , that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her , of course , very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us . I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" Poor Jane Fairfax!""--thought Emma.--""You have not deserved this ."
Jane Fairfax	You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax .
Jane Fairfax	The change on Mrs. Elton 's side soon afterwards appeared , and she was left in peace -- neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs. Elton , nor , under Mrs. Elton 's guidance , the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax , and only sharing with others in a general way , in knowing what was felt , what was meditated , what was done .
Jane Fairfax	was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth .
Jane Fairfax	She was quite one of her worthies-- the most amiable , affable , delightful woman -- just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered .
Jane Fairfax	Emma 's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do .
Jane Fairfax	She heard of her walking with the Eltons , sitting with the Eltons , spending a day with the Eltons !
Jane Fairfax	This was astonishing!--She could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer .
Jane Fairfax	""" She is a riddle , quite a riddle ! "" said she.--""To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort !"
Jane Fairfax	Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months ; the Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months ; but now the Campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer , and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there .
Jane Fairfax	Would Jane but go , means were to be found , servants sent , friends contrived -- no travelling difficulty allowed to exist ; but still she had declined it !
Jane Fairfax	""" She must have some motive , more powerful than appears , for refusing this invitation , "" was Emma 's conclusion . "" She must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the Campbells or herself ."
Jane Fairfax	There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere.-- She is _ not _ to be with the _ Dixons _ .
Jane Fairfax	"But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle . "" Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject , before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton , Mrs. Weston ventured this apology for Jane ."
Jane Fairfax	""" We can not suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma -- but it is better than being always at home ."
Jane Fairfax	Her aunt is a good creature , but , as a constant companion , must be very tiresome .
Jane Fairfax	"We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to . "" "" You are right , Mrs. Weston , "" said Mr. Knightley warmly , "" Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton ."
Jane Fairfax	Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her .
Jane Fairfax	"But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton , which nobody else pays her . """
Jane Fairfax	"With a faint blush , she presently replied , "" Such attentions as Mrs. Elton 's , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax ."
Jane Fairfax	"Mrs. Elton 's invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting . "" "" I should not wonder , "" said Mrs. Weston , "" if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt 's eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton 's civilities for her ."
Jane Fairfax	very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change .
Jane Fairfax	"Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said , "" Another thing must be taken into consideration too -- Mrs. Elton does not talk _ to _ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _ of _ her . We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other-- a something more early implanted . We can not give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before . We feel things differently . And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to . Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton 's way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness . "" "" I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax , "" said Emma ."
Jane Fairfax	""" Yes , "" he replied , "" any body may know how highly I think of her ."
Jane Fairfax	"Miss Fairfax , I dare say , would not have me if I were to ask her -- and I am very sure I shall never ask her . """
Jane Fairfax	", soon afterwards said , "" So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ? """
Jane Fairfax	no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body .
Jane Fairfax	"The result of his reverie was , "" No , Emma , I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way , I assure you . """
Jane Fairfax	"And soon afterwards , "" Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman -- but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect ."
Jane Fairfax	She has a fault .
Jane Fairfax	She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife .
Jane Fairfax	She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do for Mr. Cole ? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . Mrs. Weston , your argument weighs most with me . I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax 's mind over Mrs. Elton . I have no faith in Mrs. Elton 's acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding .
Jane Fairfax	I can not imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" Jane Fairfax has feeling , "" said Mr. Knightley--""I do not accuse her of want of feeling ."
Jane Fairfax	Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness .
Jane Fairfax	She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be -- And I love an open temper .
Jane Fairfax	I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond .
Jane Fairfax	""" Well , Mrs. Weston , "" said Emma triumphantly when he left them , "" what do you say now to Mr. Knightley 's marrying Jane Fairfax ?"
Jane Fairfax	""" Why , really , dear Emma , I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _ not _ being in love with her , that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last ."
Jane Fairfax	In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet 's confidence . To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _ one _ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma 's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs. Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates 's , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates 's parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .
Jane Fairfax	"Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement 's becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:-- but Mr. Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for "" such things , "" he observed , "" always got about . """
Jane Fairfax	Miss Fairfax 's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing ; she had drawn back and declined at first , but , on being pressed had yielded ; and , in the course of their drive , Mrs. Weston had , by gentle encouragement , overcome so much of her embarrassment , as to bring her to converse on the important subject .
Jane Fairfax	Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston , must necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement .
Jane Fairfax	Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject .
Jane Fairfax	""" On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months , "" continued Mrs. Weston , "" she was energetic ."
Jane Fairfax	This was one of her expressions .
Jane Fairfax	` I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'-- and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart .
Jane Fairfax	No one , I believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself . ` The consequence , ' said she , ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought .
Jane Fairfax	"It must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement . Her affection must have overpowered her judgment . "" "" Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him ."
Jane Fairfax	""" On your side , my love , it was very innocently done ."
Jane Fairfax	Mrs. Weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ) , this is all to be forgotten .
Jane Fairfax	You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars .
Jane Fairfax	They shew her to the greatest advantage .
Jane Fairfax	"I am sure she is very good-- I hope she will be very happy . It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers . "" Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston . She thought well of Frank in almost every respect ; and , what was more , she loved him very much , and her defence was , therefore , earnest . She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection-- but she had too much to urge for Emma 's attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs. Weston ended with , "" We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come , "" she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for . "" Are you well , my Emma ? "" was Mrs. Weston 's parting question ."
Jane Fairfax	"Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible . "" Mrs. Weston 's communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax ."
Jane Fairfax	She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause . Had she followed Mr. Knightley 's known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now.--Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax 's confidence on this important matter-- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane 's feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill 's .
Jane Fairfax	They never could have been all three together , without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax 's peace in a thousand instances ; and on Box Hill , perhaps , it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more .
Jane Fairfax	also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more ; and Miss Fairfax , it was reasonable to suppose , would soon cease to belong to Highbury .
Jane Fairfax	They were both so truly respectable in their happiness , so disinterested in every sensation ; thought so much of Jane ; so much of every body , and so little of themselves , that every kindly feeling was at work
Jane Fairfax	""" "" Poor girl"
Jane Fairfax	She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause . Had she followed Mr. Knightley 's known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now.--Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax 's confidence on this important matter-- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane 's feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill 's .
Jane Fairfax	Frank 's was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance . But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest .
Jane Fairfax	"You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five , "" had been repeated many times over ."
Jane Fairfax	You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room .
Jane Fairfax	She soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.-- She ought to go -- and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill .
Jane Fairfax	"; it was being in Miss Fairfax 's confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people . Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady 's replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods , "" We can finish this some other time , you know ."
Jane Fairfax	"She was pleased , on taking leave , to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say , "" It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility ."
Jane Fairfax	"It would be a _ secret _ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate . She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.-- The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name.-- She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , "" Beg her to walk up;""--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging ."
Jane Fairfax	She heard Miss Bates 's voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon . The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room . Jane
Jane Fairfax	"had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , "" Well , my dear , I shall _ say _ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough . "" Poor old Mrs. Bates , civil and humble as usual , looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on . "" I am afraid Jane is not very well , "" said she , "" but I do not know ; they _ tell _ me she is well ."
Jane Fairfax	I dare say my daughter will be here presently , Miss Woodhouse .
Jane Fairfax	"I am sure she will be here presently . "" Emma seriously hoped she would . She had a moment 's fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her ."
Jane Fairfax	"But Miss Bates soon came--""Very happy and obliged""--but Emma 's conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner . A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings ."
Jane Fairfax	This does not seem much like joy , indeed , in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be very trying for us to part with her , after having had her so long , and she has a dreadful headache just now , writing all the morning:-- such long letters , you know , to be written to Colonel Campbell , and Mrs. Dixon . ` My dear , ' said I , ` you will blind yourself'-- for tears were in her eyes perpetually .
Jane Fairfax	It is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , I suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , Miss Woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing her tears)--but , poor dear soul ! if you were to see what a headache she has .
Jane Fairfax	She is as low as possible .
Jane Fairfax	To look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation . You will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room-- I want her to lie down upon the bed .
Jane Fairfax	` My dear , ' said I , ` I shall say you are laid down upon the bed : ' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room .
Jane Fairfax	But , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well .
Jane Fairfax	She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her .
Jane Fairfax	Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself .
Jane Fairfax	"She spoke as she felt , with earnest regret and solicitude -- sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for Miss Fairfax 's advantage and comfort as possible . "" It must be a severe trial to them all . She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell 's return . "" "" So very kind ! "" replied Miss Bates ."
Jane Fairfax	""" But you are always kind . "" There was no bearing such an "" always ; "" and to break through her dreadful gratitude , Emma made the direct inquiry of-- "" Where -- may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going ? "" "" To a Mrs. Smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children . Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , Mrs. Suckling 's own family , and Mrs. Bragge 's ; but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove ."
Jane Fairfax	Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove .
Jane Fairfax	""" Mrs. Elton , I suppose , has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes-- "" "" Yes , our good Mrs. Elton ."
Jane Fairfax	She would not take a denial .
Jane Fairfax	She would not let Jane say , ` No ; ' for when Jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at Donwell , ) when Jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell 's return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over again -- and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than I did .
Jane Fairfax	It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take Jane 's answer ; but she positively declared she would _ not _ write any such denial yesterday , as Jane wished her ; she would wait --
Jane Fairfax	, sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go .
Jane Fairfax	"I had not the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside , and told her at once , that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge 's situation , she had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it till it was all settled . "" """
Jane Fairfax	"You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton ? """
Jane Fairfax	""" Yes , all of us ; Mrs. Elton would have us come ."
Jane Fairfax	` You _ must _ _ all _ spend your evening with us , ' said she--`I positively must have you _ all _ come . '
Jane Fairfax	""" No , not Mr. Knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though I thought he would come , because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him off , he did not;--but my mother , and Jane , and I , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had ."
Jane Fairfax	""" "" Miss Fairfax , I suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ? "" "" I dare say she had ."
Jane Fairfax	""" "" Whenever the time may come , it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends -- but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible -- I mean , as to the character and manners of the family . """
Jane Fairfax	Yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it .
Jane Fairfax	Except the Sucklings and Bragges , there is not such another nursery establishment , so liberal and elegant , in all Mrs. Elton 's acquaintance .
Jane Fairfax	Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!-- It will be nothing but pleasure , a life of pleasure.--And
Jane Fairfax	her salary!-- I really can not venture to name her salary to you , Miss Woodhouse .
Jane Fairfax	"Even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane . "" "" Ah !"
Jane Fairfax	""" And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you ?"
Jane Fairfax	""" Very soon , very soon , indeed ; that 's the worst of it . Within a fortnight . Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry ."
Jane Fairfax	My poor mother does not know how to bear it .
Jane Fairfax	So then , I try to put it out of her thoughts , and say , Come ma'am , do not let us think about it any more .
Jane Fairfax	""" Her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not Colonel and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ? """
Jane Fairfax	""" Yes ; Jane says she is sure they will ; but yet , this is such a situation as she can not feel herself justified in declining . I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton , and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it !"
Jane Fairfax	Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea , old John Abdy 's son wanted to speak with him .
Jane Fairfax	Poor old John , I have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty - seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed - ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints-- I must go and see him to - day ; and so will Jane , I am sure ,
Jane Fairfax	if she gets out at all .
Jane Fairfax	And poor John 's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he can not keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr. Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond .
Jane Fairfax	"It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton . "" Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill 's going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence ."
Jane Fairfax	What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject , being the accumulation of the ostler 's own knowledge , and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls , was , that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill-- which messenger , however , had been no more than was expected ; and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines , containing , upon the whole , a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill , and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early ; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly , without waiting at all , and his horse seeming to have got a cold , Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise , and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by , the boy going a good pace , and driving very steady .
Jane Fairfax	"The contrast between Mrs. Churchill 's importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax 's , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman 's destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates 's saying , "" Aye , I see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte ."
Jane Fairfax	"I shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties . '-- And to this day , I do believe , she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter 's . "" Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough ; and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave ."
Jane Fairfax	""" Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it , sir -- or we should not have gone ."
Jane Fairfax	my dear , but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good ; and as to myself , I have been long perfectly convinced , though perhaps I never told you so before , that the sea is very rarely of use to any body .
Jane Fairfax	I am sure it almost killed me once .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" Come , come , "" cried Emma , feeling this to be an unsafe subject , "" I must beg you not to talk of the sea ."
Jane Fairfax	It makes me envious and miserable;-- I who have never seen it !
Jane Fairfax	Poor Perry is bilious , and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country .
Jane Fairfax	I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere .
Jane Fairfax	"But then there is not so clever a man any where . "" "" And Mrs. Perry and the children , how are they ?"
Jane Fairfax	""" Why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole ."
Jane Fairfax	Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy -- except when it has been quite an influenza .
Jane Fairfax	""" That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention ."
Jane Fairfax	Perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November .
Jane Fairfax	""" No , I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _ very _ sickly except-- "" Ah !"
Jane Fairfax	my poor dear child , the truth is , that in London it is always a sickly season .
Jane Fairfax	""" No , indeed--_we _ are not at all in a bad air ."
Jane Fairfax	Our part of London is very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London in general , my dear sir .
Jane Fairfax	I should be unwilling , I own , to live in any other part of the town;-- there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in : but _ we _ are so remarkably airy!--Mr . Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air .
Jane Fairfax	I always regret excessively on dear Emma 's account that she can not be more at Highbury ; but now their daughter is married , I suppose Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all .
Jane Fairfax	"She would be such a delightful companion for Emma . """
Jane Fairfax	"Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added , "" Our little friend Harriet Smith , however , is just such another pretty kind of young person . You will like Harriet ."
Jane Fairfax	""" I am most happy to hear it -- but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma 's age . """
Jane Fairfax	The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments-- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable;--but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at South End , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin .
Jane Fairfax	there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End .
Jane Fairfax	""" And , moreover , if you must go to the sea , it had better not have been to South End ."
Jane Fairfax	""" "" You should have gone to Cromer , my dear , if you went anywhere.-- Perry was a week at Cromer once , and he holds it to be the best of all the sea - bathing places ."
Jane Fairfax	Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax 's situation with Mr. Knightley.-- Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it might have happened at a better time -- and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them half an hour , she found .
Jane Fairfax	In the hope of diverting her father 's thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley 's going to London ; and going so suddenly ; and going on horseback , which she knew would be all very bad ; Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax , and her dependence on the effect was justified ; it supplied a very useful check,-- interested , without disturbing him .
Jane Fairfax	He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax 's going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr. Knightley 's going to London had been an unexpected blow .
Jane Fairfax	""" I am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled ."
Jane Fairfax	Mrs. Elton is very good - natured and agreeable , and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be .
Jane Fairfax	I hope it is a dry situation , and that her health will be taken good care of . It ought to be a first object , as I am sure poor Miss Taylor 's always was with me .
Jane Fairfax	You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us .
Jane Fairfax	"And I hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long . "" The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background . An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill !"
Jane Fairfax	Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account
Jane Fairfax	, she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return . A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle .
Jane Fairfax	The great Mrs. Churchill was no more .
Jane Fairfax	Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried .
Jane Fairfax	Mrs. Churchill , after being disliked at least twenty - five years , was now spoken of with compassionate allowances .
Jane Fairfax	In one point she was fully justified .
Jane Fairfax	"She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill . The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints . """
Jane Fairfax	Poor Mrs. Churchill !
Jane Fairfax	no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper . It was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults , what would Mr. Churchill do without her ?
Jane Fairfax	"Mr. Churchill would never get over it . ""-- Even Mr. Weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said , "" Ah ! poor woman , who would have thought it ! "" and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense , true and steady ."
Jane Fairfax	The character of Mrs. Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed .
Jane Fairfax	Mr. Churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew .
Jane Fairfax	They spoke , therefore , of Mrs. Churchill 's death with mutual forbearance . Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans .
Jane Fairfax	It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet 's opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield .
Jane Fairfax	""" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ; "" and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge 's at the time proposed ."
Jane Fairfax	Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged-- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr. Perry was uneasy about her .
Jane Fairfax	He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it .
Jane Fairfax	Her spirits seemed overcome .
Jane Fairfax	Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:-- confined always to one room;--he could have wished it otherwise-- and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description .
Jane Fairfax	Her care and attention could not be questioned ; they were , in fact , only too great .
Jane Fairfax	He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them . Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful .
Jane Fairfax	To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name-- mentioning that she had Mr. Perry 's decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient .
Jane Fairfax	"The answer was only in this short note : "" Miss Fairfax 's compliments and thanks , but is quite unequal to any exercise . """
Jane Fairfax	When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together-- that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _ her _ .
Jane Fairfax	Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove .
Jane Fairfax	To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name-- mentioning that she had Mr. Perry 's decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient .
Jane Fairfax	In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs. Bates 's , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her-- but it would not do;--Miss
Jane Fairfax	Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in .
Jane Fairfax	""" Indeed , the truth was , that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all-- Mrs. Elton , indeed , could not be denied -- and Mrs. Cole had made such a point -- and Mrs. Perry had said so much -- but , except them , Jane would really see nobody . """
Jane Fairfax	Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons , the Mrs. Perrys , and the Mrs. Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself-- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece 's appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing:-- Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful .
Jane Fairfax	"In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but "" dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing . """
Jane Fairfax	When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together-- that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _ her _ .
Jane Fairfax	""" These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them . Only let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion . "" He went to Highbury the next morning , and satisfied himself on that point ."
Jane Fairfax	Was not she like a daughter , his eldest daughter?--he must tell her ; and Miss Bates being present , it passed , of course , to Mrs. Cole , Mrs. Perry , and Mrs. Elton , immediately afterwards . It was no more than the principals were prepared for ; they had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls , how soon it would be over Highbury ; and were thinking of themselves , as the evening wonder in many a family circle , with great sagacity .
Jane Fairfax	Some might think him , and others might think her , the most in luck . One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell , and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys ; and another might predict disagreements among their servants ; but yet , upon the whole , there was no serious objection raised , except in one habitation , the Vicarage.--There , the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction .
Jane Fairfax	The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs. Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte . Busy as he was , however , the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" I have not been working uninterruptedly , "" he replied , "" I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe ."
Jane Fairfax	"This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come . I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home . """
Jane Fairfax	He contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again .
Jane Fairfax	That she was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again .
Jane Fairfax	At last Jane began , and though the first bars were feebly given , the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to .
Jane Fairfax	I dare say , Miss Fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to Broadwood himself .
Jane Fairfax	Do not you think so ?
Jane Fairfax	""" Jane did not look round . She was not obliged to hear ."
Jane Fairfax	Mrs. Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment .
Jane Fairfax	"Do not distress her . "" He shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy . Soon afterwards he began again , "" How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , Miss Fairfax ."
Jane Fairfax	I dare say they often think of you , and wonder which will be the day , the precise day of the instrument 's coming to hand .
Jane Fairfax	"Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ? "" He paused . She could not but hear ; she could not avoid answering , "" Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell , "" said she , in a voice of forced calmness , "" I can imagine nothing with any confidence ."
Jane Fairfax	What nonsense one talks , Miss Woodhouse , when hard at work , if one talks at all;--your real workmen , I suppose , hold their tongues ; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word -- Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing .
Jane Fairfax	I have the pleasure , madam , ( to Mrs. Bates , ) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present .
Jane Fairfax	""" He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged Miss Fairfax , who was still sitting at it , to play something more . """
Jane Fairfax	"If you are very kind , "" said he , "" it will be one of the waltzes we danced"
Jane Fairfax	"You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time . I believe you were glad we danced no longer ; but I would have given worlds-- all the worlds one ever has to give -- for another half - hour . """
Jane Fairfax	She played .
Jane Fairfax	""" What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _ has _ made one happy!-- If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth . """
Jane Fairfax	"She looked up at him for a moment , coloured deeply , and played something else . He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte , and turning to Emma , said , "" Here is something quite new to me . Do you know it?--Cramer.--"
Jane Fairfax	Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell , was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here . I honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart .
Jane Fairfax	""" Emma wished he would be less pointed , yet could not help being amused ; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile , when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness , there had been a smile of secret delight , she had less scruple in the amusement , and much less compunction with respect to her.--This amiable , upright , perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings ."
Jane Fairfax	"He brought all the music to her , and they looked it over together.-- Emma took the opportunity of whispering , "" You speak too plain ."
Jane Fairfax	She must understand you .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" I hope she does ."
Jane Fairfax	I would have her understand me .
Jane Fairfax	"I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning . "" "" But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea ."
Jane Fairfax	""" I am very glad you did , and that you communicated it to me . I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways ."
Jane Fairfax	Leave shame to her .
Jane Fairfax	If she does wrong , she ought to feel it .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" She is not entirely without it , I think ."
Jane Fairfax	""" "" I do not see much sign of it . She is playing _ Robin _ _ Adair _ at this moment--_his _ favourite . """
Jane Fairfax	I will not open the window here ; it would give you all cold ; but I can go into my mother 's room you know .
Jane Fairfax	"You will find some friends here . """
Jane Fairfax	"So began Miss Bates ; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn , for most resolutely and commandingly did he say , "" How is your niece , Miss Bates?--I"
Jane Fairfax	want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece .
Jane Fairfax	How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no cold last night .
Jane Fairfax	How is she to - day ?
Jane Fairfax	"Tell me how Miss Fairfax is . """
Jane Fairfax	"The listeners were amused ; and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning . But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism . "" So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage , "" resumed Miss Bates . He cut her short with , "" I am going to Kingston . Can I do any thing for you ?"
Jane Fairfax	"Can I do any thing for _ you _ ? """
Jane Fairfax	"I will call another day , and hear the pianoforte . "" "" Well , I am so sorry!--Oh ! Mr. Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?-- Was not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it . "" "" Oh !"
Jane Fairfax	very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes .
Jane Fairfax	And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too . I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England .
Jane Fairfax	Now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but I can not stay to hear it .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" Oh ! Mr. Knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence-- so shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples !"
Jane Fairfax	"He asked me if he could do any thing . . . . "" "" Yes , "" said Jane , "" we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing . "" "" Oh !"
Jane Fairfax	yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr. Knightley spoke loud .
Jane Fairfax	` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ? ' said he ; so I just mentioned . . . .
Jane Fairfax	"Miss Woodhouse , must you be going?--You seem but just come -- so very obliging of you . """
Jane Fairfax	"After waiting a moment , as if to be sure she intended to say no more , he replied , "" If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already . """
Jane Fairfax	What years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him!--Assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for Jane Fairfax 's character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour,-- equality of situation -- I mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one-- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _ her _ regard , must , I think , be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune .
Jane Fairfax	There was too much domestic happiness in his brother 's house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; Isabella was too much like Emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer.--He had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning 's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer . He had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery .
Jane Fairfax	and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!--I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt-- I could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?-- Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature .
Jane Fairfax	""" And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ? "" "" Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs. Weston , is it ?"
Jane Fairfax	Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.-- A most deplorable want of complexion .
Jane Fairfax	Emma would not agree to this , and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax 's complexion .
Jane Fairfax	""" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face . """
Jane Fairfax	"Where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was . "" Well , "" said Emma , "" there is no disputing about taste.--At least you admire her except her complexion ."
Jane Fairfax	"He shook his head and laughed.--""I can not separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Did you see her often at Weymouth ?"
Jane Fairfax	""" I merely asked , whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth . "" "" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a"
Jane Fairfax	Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.-- I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow .
Jane Fairfax	you answer as discreetly as she could do herself .
Jane Fairfax	But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her .
Jane Fairfax	I met her frequently at Weymouth .
Jane Fairfax	"I like them all . "" "" You know Miss Fairfax 's situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ? "" "" Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do . "" "" You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , "" said Mrs. Weston smiling ; "" remember that I am here.--Mr . Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax 's situation in life ."
Jane Fairfax	"I will move a little farther off . "" "" I certainly do forget to think of _ her _ , "" said Emma , "" as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend . """
Jane Fairfax	"We shall know more about them all , in half an hour , from you , than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year . "" "" Yes , Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof . "" "" Certainly -- very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _ I _ had been Miss Campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me ."
Jane Fairfax	How did Miss Campbell appear to like it ?
Jane Fairfax	""" "" It was her very particular friend , you know ."
Jane Fairfax	"It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell ; but she really did not seem to feel it . "" "" So much the better -- or so much the worse:--I do not know which ."
Jane Fairfax	But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling -- there was one person , I think , who must have felt it : Miss Fairfax herself .
Jane Fairfax	"She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction . "" "" As to that -- I do not-- "" "" Oh ! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax 's sensations from you , or from any body else . They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself ."
Jane Fairfax	But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon , one may guess what one chuses .
Jane Fairfax	But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends ."
Jane Fairfax	And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved .
Jane Fairfax	Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question .
Jane Fairfax	"I have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal . "" He perfectly agreed with her : and after walking together so long , and thinking so much alike , Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him , that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting . He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected ."
Jane Fairfax	She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr. Elton 's house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with .
Jane Fairfax	They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure .
Jane Fairfax	""" Is not she looking well ? "" said he , turning his eyes towards Jane ."
Jane Fairfax	""" Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston doat upon her ."
Jane Fairfax	""" I have some hope , "" resumed he , "" of my uncle 's being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her . When the Campbells are returned , we shall meet them in London , and continue there , I trust , till we may carry her northward.--But now , I am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard , Miss Woodhouse?-- Till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation . Do not you pity me ? """
Jane Fairfax	fair.--One can not call her fair .
Jane Fairfax	It is a most uncommon complexion , with her dark eye - lashes and hair-- a most distinguishing complexion !
Jane Fairfax	""" I have always admired her complexion , "" replied Emma , archly ; "" but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?-- When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten ?"
Jane Fairfax	is a complete angel .
Jane Fairfax	Look at her .
Jane Fairfax	Is not she an angel in every gesture ?
Jane Fairfax	Observe the turn of her throat .
Jane Fairfax	Observe her eyes , as she is looking up at my father.-- You will be glad to hear ( inclining his head , and whispering seriously ) that my uncle means to give her all my aunt 's jewels .
Jane Fairfax	Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair ?
Jane Fairfax	"What are they saying about Mr. Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel now?--Has he set up his carriage ? "" Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from Jane 's countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf ."
Jane Fairfax	""" I can never think of it without laughing.--She hears us , she hears us , Miss Woodhouse ."
Jane Fairfax	I see it in her cheek , her smile , her vain attempt to frown .
Jane Fairfax	Look at her .
Jane Fairfax	"Do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye-- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ? """
Jane Fairfax	He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma 's feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley 's high superiority of character .
Jane Fairfax	"You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax ? "" "" I can not name a day , "" said he , "" till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you ."
Jane Fairfax	Well , I shall bring Jane with me-- Jane and her aunt.--The rest I leave to you .
Jane Fairfax	""" That 's quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every day:--but as you like ."
Jane Fairfax	And Jane will have such another .
Jane Fairfax	The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me -- and my caro sposo walking by .
Jane Fairfax	""" Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy.-- She had some fears of his horse . Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.-- A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question ."
Jane Fairfax	Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend 's negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.-- Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow 's post.--How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma.--She
Jane Fairfax	did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal.--
Jane Fairfax	and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need . Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse 's entertainment .
Jane Fairfax	"And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more I shall like you . "" Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St. Mark 's Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room ."
Jane Fairfax	With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill ; others took it very composedly ; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax 's disappearance being explained . That it was time for every body to go , concluded the subject ; and with a short final arrangement for the next day 's scheme , they parted .
Jane Fairfax	, however , Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments ' free observation of the entrance and ground - plot of the house -- and was hardly there , when Jane Fairfax appeared , coming quickly in from the garden , and with a look of escape.-- Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon , there was a start at first ; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of .
Jane Fairfax	Let my father 's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage .
Jane Fairfax	XVII When the ladies returned to the drawing - room after dinner , Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;-- with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself .
Jane Fairfax	If Jane repressed her for a little time , she soon began again ; and though much that passed between them was in a half - whisper , especially on Mrs. Elton 's side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects :
Jane Fairfax	"The post - office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship , were long under discussion ; and to them succeeded one , which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , and professions of Mrs. Elton 's meditated activity . "" Here is April come ! "" said she , "" I get quite anxious about you ."
Jane Fairfax	""" But I have never fixed on June or any other month -- merely looked forward to the summer in general . """
Jane Fairfax	""" But have you really heard of nothing ? "" """
Jane Fairfax	"I have not even made any inquiry ; I do not wish to make any yet . "" """
Jane Fairfax	"my dear , we can not begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing . """
Jane Fairfax	""" I not aware ! "" said Jane , shaking her head ; "" dear Mrs. Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ?"
Jane Fairfax	""" But you have not seen so much of the world as I have . You do not know how many candidates there always are for the _ first _ situations ."
Jane Fairfax	You may imagine how desirable !
Jane Fairfax	Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge 's is the one I would most wish to see you in .
Jane Fairfax	""" Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer , "" said Jane ."
Jane Fairfax	""" I must spend some time with them ; I am sure they will want it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself . But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present . "" "" Trouble !"
Jane Fairfax	aye , I know your scruples .
Jane Fairfax	You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am .
Jane Fairfax	""" Thank you , but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , I do not wish to be giving any body trouble . """
Jane Fairfax	""" But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us ."
Jane Fairfax	Your inexperience really amuses me !
Jane Fairfax	"A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment 's notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly . "" "" Excuse me , ma'am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends ."
Jane Fairfax	When I am quite determined as to the time , I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed .
Jane Fairfax	my dear , human flesh !
Jane Fairfax	"You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition . "" "" I did not mean , I was not thinking of the slave - trade , "" replied Jane ; "" governess - trade , I assure you , was all that I had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , I do not know where it lies ."
Jane Fairfax	But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices , and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do .
Jane Fairfax	""" Aye , _ that _ may suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life ."
Jane Fairfax	""" You are very obliging ; but as to all that , I am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , I think , would only be the greater ; I should suffer more from comparison ."
Jane Fairfax	"A gentleman 's family is all that I should condition for . "" "" I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle ."
Jane Fairfax	Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is -- I do not know-- if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play;--yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest .
Jane Fairfax	""" You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together , "" said Jane , "" they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs. Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer ."
Jane Fairfax	For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am , and as I am .
Jane Fairfax	""" In this style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room ; her vanity had then a change of object , and Emma heard her saying in the same half - whisper to Jane , "" Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest!--Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature he is;--I assure you I like him excessively . I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me ."
Jane Fairfax	They were the first entitled , after Mrs. Weston and Emma , to be made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her .
Jane Fairfax	But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in -- observing , as she proposed it to Harriet , that , as well as she could calculate , they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax .
Jane Fairfax	She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton ; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles , to usher in a letter from her niece .
Jane Fairfax	yes -- Mr. Elton , I understand -- certainly as to dancing-- Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was-- Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of Jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , Jane is so very great a favourite there . Whenever she is with us , Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can .
Jane Fairfax	And so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , ` I know you can not have heard from Jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ; ' and when I immediately said , ` But indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning , ' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized . ` Have you , upon your honour ? ' said she ; ` well , that is quite unexpected .
Jane Fairfax	Do let me hear what she says . '
Jane Fairfax	""" Emma 's politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest-- "" Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately ?"
Jane Fairfax	"I hope she is well ? "" "" Thank you ."
Jane Fairfax	I was reading it to Mrs. Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her-- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says;--but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see-- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half .
Jane Fairfax	Jane often says , when she is here , ` I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish my eyes may last me as well . '
Jane Fairfax	""" All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath ; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax 's handwriting ."
Jane Fairfax	"Ma'am , "" addressing her , "" do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane 's handwriting ? """
Jane Fairfax	"She was pondering , in the meanwhile , upon the possibility , without seeming very rude , of making her escape from Jane Fairfax 's letter , and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse , when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention . "" My mother 's deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all ."
Jane Fairfax	But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me . Jane speaks so distinct !
Jane Fairfax	""" Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon ? "" "" Oh yes ; next week . "" "" Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure ."
Jane Fairfax	I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury , as they can be to see her . Yes , Friday or Saturday ; she can not say which , because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days .
Jane Fairfax	So very good of them to send her the whole way !
Jane Fairfax	Oh yes , Friday or Saturday next . That is what she writes about .
Jane Fairfax	"That is the reason of her writing out of rule , as we call it ; for , in the common course , we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday . "" "" Yes , so I imagined ."
Jane Fairfax	"I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to - day . "" "" So obliging of you ! No , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon . My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months with us at least ."
Jane Fairfax	They had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last October , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , I was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , I declare I do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in Jane 's letter -- wrote in Mr. Dixon 's name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly ,
Jane Fairfax	Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from Mr. Dixon , I mean-- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter 's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon , for which I do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland ; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself .
Jane Fairfax	"Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland , from his account of things . "" At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma 's brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr. Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery , "" You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time ."
Jane Fairfax	Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs. Dixon , you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell .
Jane Fairfax	The very thing that we have always been rather afraid of ; for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us , for months together -- not able to come if any thing was to happen .
Jane Fairfax	They want her ( Mr. and Mrs. Dixon ) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell ; quite depend upon it ; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _ joint _ invitation , Jane says , as you will hear presently ; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention . He is a most charming young man .
Jane Fairfax	Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit-- ( I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we had the history of that day , I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon !
Jane Fairfax	""" But , in spite of all her friends ' urgency , and her own wish of seeing Ireland , Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates ? """
Jane Fairfax	""" Yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and Colonel and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _ wish _ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately . "" """
Jane Fairfax	Mrs. Dixon , I understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with Miss Fairfax .
Jane Fairfax	Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain -- but extremely elegant and amiable .
Jane Fairfax	""" Jane caught a bad cold , poor thing !"
Jane Fairfax	A long time , is not it , for a cold to hang upon her ?
Jane Fairfax	She never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us . Just like her !
Jane Fairfax	so considerate!--But however , she is so far from well , that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home , and try an air that always agrees with her ; and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her-- and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here , than go to Ireland , if she is unwell .
Jane Fairfax	"Nobody could nurse her , as we should do . "" "" It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world ."
Jane Fairfax	""" And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday , and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following-- as you will find from Jane 's letter ."
Jane Fairfax	If it was not for the drawback of her illness -- but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin , and looking very poorly .
Jane Fairfax	I always make a point of reading Jane 's letters through to myself first , before I read them aloud to my mother , you know , for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her .
Jane Fairfax	Jane desired me to do it , so I always do : and so I began to - day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell , than I burst out , quite frightened , with ` Bless me !
Jane Fairfax	poor Jane is ill!'-- which my mother , being on the watch , heard distinctly , and was sadly
Jane Fairfax	If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr. Perry . The expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know . He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .
Jane Fairfax	Well , now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" I am afraid we must be running away , "" said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise--""My father will be expecting us ."
Jane Fairfax	She regained the street -- happy in this , that though much had been forced on her against her will , though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax 's letter , she had been able to escape the letter itself .
Jane Fairfax	Jane Fairfax.--
Jane Fairfax	Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley , she was more conscience - stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been.--Mr
Jane Fairfax	"He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her . "" This is very true , "" said she , "" at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--"
Jane Fairfax	, he was talking to Miss Fairfax .
Jane Fairfax	Mrs. Elton , as elegant as lace and pearls could make her , he looked at in silence-- wanting only to observe enough for Isabella 's information -- but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl , and he could talk to her . He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys , when it had been just beginning to rain .
Jane Fairfax	"It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject , and he said , "" I hope you did not venture far , Miss Fairfax , this morning , or I am sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time ."
Jane Fairfax	I hope you turned directly .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" I went only to the post - office , "" said she , "" and reached home before the rain was much ."
Jane Fairfax	It is my daily errand .
Jane Fairfax	I always fetch the letters when I am here . It saves trouble , and is a something to get me out .
Jane Fairfax	"A walk before breakfast does me good . "" "" Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine . "" "" No , but it did not absolutely rain when I set out . """
Jane Fairfax	"Mr. John Knightley smiled , and replied , "" That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before ."
Jane Fairfax	"When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for . "" There was a little blush , and then this answer , "" I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I can not expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters . "" "" Indifferent !"
Jane Fairfax	"I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation . You have every body dearest to you always at hand , I , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections , a post - office , I think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day . "" "" When I talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years , "" said John Knightley , "" I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings . I consider one as including the other ."
Jane Fairfax	Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle -- but that is not the change I had in view for you .
Jane Fairfax	"As an old friend , you will allow me to hope , Miss Fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have . "" It was kindly said , and very far from giving offence ."
Jane Fairfax	"A pleasant "" thank you "" seemed meant to laugh it off , but a blush , a quivering lip , a tear in the eye , shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh . Her attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse , who being , according to his custom on such occasions , making the circle of his guests , and paying his particular compliments to the ladies , was ending with her -- and with all his mildest urbanity , said , "" I am very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain . Young ladies should take care of themselves.--"
Jane Fairfax	My dear , did you change your stockings ?
Jane Fairfax	""" "" Yes , sir , I did indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me . """
Jane Fairfax	""" My dear Miss Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for.-- I hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well ."
Jane Fairfax	You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure .
Jane Fairfax	By this time , the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton , and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane .
Jane Fairfax	""" My dear Jane , what is this I hear?--Going to the post - office in the rain!--This must not be , I assure you.--You sad girl , how could you do such a thing?--It"
Jane Fairfax	is a sign I was not there to take care of you .
Jane Fairfax	"Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold . """
Jane Fairfax	You really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself.--To the post - office indeed ! Mrs. Weston , did you ever hear the like ?
Jane Fairfax	Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks.-- Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year .
Jane Fairfax	Better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again .
Jane Fairfax	Now do not you feel that you had ?
Jane Fairfax	Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable .
Jane Fairfax	"You look as if you would not do such a thing again . "" "" Oh !"
Jane Fairfax	"she _ shall _ _ not _ do such a thing again , "" eagerly rejoined Mrs. Elton ."
Jane Fairfax	""" We will not allow her to do such a thing again:""-- and nodding significantly--""there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed ."
Jane Fairfax	The man who fetches our letters every morning ( one of our men , I forget his name ) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you . That will obviate all difficulties you know ; and from _ us _ I really think , my dear Jane , you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation .
Jane Fairfax	""" You are extremely kind , "" said Jane ; "" but I can not give up my early walk ."
Jane Fairfax	I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can , I must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before .
Jane Fairfax	""" My dear Jane , say no more about it . The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master . You know , Mrs. Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves ."
Jane Fairfax	But I do flatter myself , my dear Jane , that my influence is not entirely worn out .
Jane Fairfax	"If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . "" "" Excuse me , "" said Jane earnestly , "" I can not by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant ."
Jane Fairfax	"If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama 's . "" "" Oh !"
Jane Fairfax	my dear ; but so much as Patty has
Jane Fairfax	"it is a kindness to employ our men . "" Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered ; but instead of answering , she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley ."
Jane Fairfax	""" The post - office is a wonderful establishment ! "" said she.-- "" The regularity and despatch of it !"
Jane Fairfax	"If you want any farther explanation , "" continued he , smiling , "" they are paid for it ."
Jane Fairfax	Jane 's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma .
Jane Fairfax	She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax 's feelings ; and they followed the other ladies out of the room , arm in arm , with an appearance of good - will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each .
Jane Fairfax	The Eltons walked together ; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill .
Jane Fairfax	Pass Mr. E. , Knightley , Jane , and myself .
Jane Fairfax	Come , Jane , take my other arm .
Jane Fairfax	Jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off .
Jane Fairfax	""" Now , ma'am , "" said Jane to her aunt , "" shall we join Mrs. Elton ? "" "" If you please , my dear ."
Jane Fairfax	"How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance , and rued it all the rest of his life ! "" Miss Fairfax , who had seldom spoken before , except among her own confederates , spoke now ."
Jane Fairfax	"""--She was stopped by a cough ."
Jane Fairfax	"Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen . "" You were speaking , "" said he , gravely ."
Jane Fairfax	She recovered her voice .
Jane Fairfax	""" I was only going to observe , that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women , I can not imagine them to be very frequent ."
Jane Fairfax	A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise-- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards . I would
Jane Fairfax	Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury , and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills were also in town ; and they were only waiting for November .
Jane Fairfax	""" But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax ! "" said Mr. Weston , looking about ."
Jane Fairfax	Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs. Weston 's to receive them .
Jane Fairfax	Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma ; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her.--He was thoughtful .
Jane Fairfax	""" I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane ."
Jane Fairfax	And Jane declares-- Well!--(as soon as she was within the door ) Well !
Jane Fairfax	Nothing wanting . Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!-- Jane , Jane , look!--did you ever see any thing ?
Jane Fairfax	Jane and I quite ready .
Jane Fairfax	Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been.--
Jane Fairfax	There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time .
Jane Fairfax	My dear Jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two , but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely-- and there was a mat to step upon -- I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh !
Jane Fairfax	Does not she , Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?-- Ah !
Jane Fairfax	This is meeting quite in fairy - land!-- Such a transformation!--Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude -- but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look -- how do you like Jane 's hair?--You are a judge.-- She did it all herself .
Jane Fairfax	Quite wonderful how she does her hair!--
Jane Fairfax	"After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look , compliments very quietly and properly taken , Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself-- and it was , "" How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?-- How has Wright done my hair?""--with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness ."
Jane Fairfax	""" At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously , that Emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises , and did not want to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while , till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton 's tones again distinctly forward.--Mr . Elton had just joined them , and his wife was exclaiming , "" Oh ! you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion?-- I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us ."
Jane Fairfax	""" Jane!""--repeated Frank Churchill , with a look of surprize and displeasure.-- "" That is easy -- but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Jane , Jane , my dear Jane , where are you?--Here is your tippet ."
Jane Fairfax	, indeed you must .
Jane Fairfax	Excellent dancing indeed!-- Yes , my dear , I ran home , as I said I should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me.--I
Jane Fairfax	Grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ` Oh ! ' said I , ` I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr. Elton ,
Jane Fairfax	I do not know who will ask her next , perhaps Mr. William Cox .
Jane Fairfax	Jane on one arm , and me on the other!--Stop , stop , let us stand a little back , Mrs. Elton is going ; dear Mrs. Elton , how elegant she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train .
Jane Fairfax	Two steps , Jane , take care of the two steps .
Jane Fairfax	I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style -- Candles everywhere.--I was telling you of your grandmama , Jane,--There was a little disappointment.-- The baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good Mr. Woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again .
Jane Fairfax	Anywhere , so that Jane is not in a draught . Where _ I _ sit is of no consequence .
Jane Fairfax	An unpretending , single - minded , artless girl-- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton .
Jane Fairfax	", he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma . He had been used to think her unjust to Jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement . "" A very pleasant evening , "" he began , as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary , told that he understood , and the papers swept away;--""particularly pleasant . You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music ."
Jane Fairfax	I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one 's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma .
Jane Fairfax	I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother 's , it must have been a real indulgence .
Jane Fairfax	""" An arch look expressed--""I understand you well enough ; "" but she said only , "" Miss Fairfax is reserved . """
Jane Fairfax	""" I always told you she was -- a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence ."
Jane Fairfax	""" You think her diffident . I do not see it . "" "" My dear Emma , "" said he , moving from his chair into one close by her , "" you are not going to tell me , I hope , that you had not a pleasant evening . "" "" Oh !"
Jane Fairfax	I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed .
Jane Fairfax	"She must have found the evening agreeable , Mr. Knightley , because she had Emma . "" "" True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax . "" Emma saw his anxiety , and wishing to appease it , at least for the present , said , and with a sincerity which no one could question-- "" She is a sort of elegant creature that one can not keep one 's eyes from . I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart . """
Jane Fairfax	", he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma . He had been used to think her unjust to Jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement . "" A very pleasant evening , "" he began , as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary , told that he understood , and the papers swept away;--""particularly pleasant . You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music ."
Jane Fairfax	For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole 's note -- no , it can not be more than five-- or at least ten -- for I had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out -- I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork -- Jane was standing in the passage -- were not you , Jane?-- for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough . So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ` Shall I go down instead ?
Jane Fairfax	for I think you have a little cold , and Patty has been washing the kitchen .
Jane Fairfax	my dear , ' said I -- well , and just then came the note .
Jane Fairfax	A Miss Hawkins-- that 's all I know .
Jane Fairfax	"A Miss Hawkins-- "" "" I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago ."
Jane Fairfax	He had just read Elton 's letter as I was shewn in , and handed it to me directly .
Jane Fairfax	that is quite -- I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting .
Jane Fairfax	My dear sir , you really are too bountiful .
Jane Fairfax	My mother desires her very best compliments and regards , and a thousand thanks , and says you really quite oppress her .
Jane Fairfax	my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us .
Jane Fairfax	If ever there were people who , without having great wealth themselves , had every thing they could wish for , I am sure it is us .
Jane Fairfax	Jane , you have never seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him .
Jane Fairfax	""" Jane 's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her ."
Jane Fairfax	""" No -- I have never seen Mr. Elton , "" she replied , starting on this appeal ; "" is he -- is he a tall man ? """
Jane Fairfax	"When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind . "" "" Very true , Miss Woodhouse , so she will . He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry ."
Jane Fairfax	His extreme attention to my mother-- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know -- it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick .
Jane Fairfax	Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf . He fancied bathing might be good for it -- the warm bath-- but she says it did him no lasting benefit .
Jane Fairfax	"I say , sir , "" turning to Mr. Woodhouse , "" I think there are few places with such society as Highbury ."
Jane Fairfax	"I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork-- a roast loin of pork-- "" "" As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her , "" said Emma , "" nothing I suppose can be known ."
Jane Fairfax	""" When I have seen Mr. Elton , "" replied Jane , "" I dare say I shall be interested -- but I believe it requires _ that _ with me ."
Jane Fairfax	Jane , do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley .
Jane Fairfax	"I mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative . "" "" Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all . "" "" Very odd !"
Jane Fairfax	"Mr. Dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ? "" "" Handsome !"
Jane Fairfax	But I gave what I believed the general opinion , when I called him plain .
Jane Fairfax	""" Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away ."
Jane Fairfax	and , Jane , you had better go home directly -- I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already .
Jane Fairfax	Thank you , we do indeed .
Jane Fairfax	"Well , that is so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm.--Mr . Elton , and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning to you . """
Jane Fairfax	"If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning to rain , Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs. Goddard 's , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation . The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the "" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened ! "" which instantly burst forth , had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation ."
Jane Fairfax	dear , Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another .
Jane Fairfax	I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would . She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _ try _ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble!--I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind !
Jane Fairfax	He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane 's age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter 's great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .
Jane Fairfax	It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell 's family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time .
Jane Fairfax	Such was Jane Fairfax 's history .
Jane Fairfax	It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over . The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane 's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents . They continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of Miss Campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn .
Jane Fairfax	This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning .
Jane Fairfax	She had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period . With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever .
Jane Fairfax	"It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- Mr. Frank Churchill -- must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence . Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . But "" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other . """
Jane Fairfax	It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating .
Jane Fairfax	Jane Fairfax was very elegant , remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value for elegance .
Jane Fairfax	Her height was pretty , just such as almost every body would think tall , and nobody could think very tall ; her figure particularly graceful ; her size a most becoming medium , between fat and thin , though a slight appearance of ill - health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two .
Jane Fairfax	In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer . When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself . In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on .
Jane Fairfax	"These were charming feelings -- but not lasting . Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr. Knightley , "" She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome ! """
Jane Fairfax	Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state .
Jane Fairfax	The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane 's offences rose again .
Jane Fairfax	The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother 's ; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton 's activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will . Mr. Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more . He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma .
Jane Fairfax	But while so many were devoting him to Emma , and Emma herself making him over to Harriet , Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax .
Jane Fairfax	He could not understand it ; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least-- symptoms of admiration on his side , which , having once observed , he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish to escape any of Emma 's errors of imagination . _ She _ was not present when the suspicion first arose .
Jane Fairfax	He was dining with the Randalls family , and Jane , at the Eltons ' ; and he had seen a look , more than a single look , at Miss Fairfax , which , from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse , seemed somewhat out of place .
Jane Fairfax	"When he was again in their company , he could not help remembering what he had seen ; nor could he avoid observations which , unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight , "" Myself creating what I saw , "" brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking , of private understanding even , between Frank Churchill and Jane ."
Jane Fairfax	Jane , do n't you remember grandmama 's telling us of it when we got home ? I forget where we had been walking to-- very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls .
Jane Fairfax	I am not like Jane ; I wish I were .
Jane Fairfax	I will answer for it _ she _ never betrayed the least thing in the world .
Jane Fairfax	Where is she?--Oh !
Jane Fairfax	Mr. Knightley 's eyes had preceded Miss Bates 's in a glance at Jane .
Jane Fairfax	From Frank Churchill 's face , where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away , he had involuntarily turned to hers ; but she was indeed behind , and too busy with her shawl .
Jane Fairfax	The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass . Mr. Knightley
Jane Fairfax	suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye-- he seemed watching her intently -- in vain , however , if it were so-- Jane passed between them into the hall , and looked at neither
Jane Fairfax	""" Miss Woodhouse , "" said Frank Churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , "" have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ? It used to stand here ."
Jane Fairfax	"I want to puzzle you again . "" Emma was pleased with the thought ; and producing the box , the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets , which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves ."
Jane Fairfax	"The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the "" poor little boys , "" or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it . Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax ."
Jane Fairfax	She gave a slight glance round the table , and applied herself to it .
Jane Fairfax	Frank was next to Emma , Jane opposite to them -- and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them all ; and it was his object to see as much as he could , with as little apparent observation .
Jane Fairfax	If meant to be immediately mixed with the others , and buried from sight , she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across , for it was not mixed ; and Harriet , eager after every fresh word , and finding out none , directly took it up , and fell to work .
Jane Fairfax	The word was _ blunder _ ; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it , there was a blush on Jane 's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible .
Jane Fairfax	How the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep ! He feared there must be some decided involvement .
Jane Fairfax	"He heard Frank Churchill next say , with a glance towards Jane , "" I will give it to her -- shall I?""--and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth . "" No , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed . "" It was done however ."
Jane Fairfax	This gallant young man , who seemed to love without feeling , and to recommend himself without complaisance , directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax , and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it .
Jane Fairfax	"Jane Fairfax 's perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged . She was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only , "" I did not know that proper names were allowed , "" pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered ."
Jane Fairfax	Her face was averted from those who had made the attack , and turned towards her aunt .
Jane Fairfax	""" Aye , very true , my dear , "" cried the latter , though Jane had not spoken a word--""I was just going to say the same thing ."
Jane Fairfax	My dear sir , you are too obliging .
Jane Fairfax	"We really must wish you good night . """
Jane Fairfax	Jane 's alertness in moving , proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived .
Jane Fairfax	""" Pray , Emma , "" said he , "" may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ?"
Jane Fairfax	""" "" Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ? Oh !"
Jane Fairfax	"yes , perfectly.-- Why do you make a doubt of it ? "" "" Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ? "" "" Never , never ! "" she cried with a most open eagerness--""Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me ."
Jane Fairfax	There is no admiration between them , I do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather of a totally different nature-- it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of nonsense in it -- but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be .
Jane Fairfax	She spoke with a confidence which staggered , with a satisfaction which silenced , Mr. Knightley .
Jane Fairfax	She was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the where s and how s of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers .
Jane Fairfax	The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day ; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity . She must have delighted the Coles -- worthy people , who deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind her that would not soon die away . Perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy . She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax 's feelings to Frank Churchill .
Jane Fairfax	The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax ; and there she had no doubt .
Jane Fairfax	""" Oh ! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax ! "" "" Do n't class us together , Harriet ."
Jane Fairfax	My playing is no more like her 's , than a lamp is like sunshine .
Jane Fairfax	"I think you play quite as well as she does . I am sure I had much rather hear you . Every body last night said how well you played . "" "" Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference ."
Jane Fairfax	The truth is , Harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but Jane Fairfax 's is much beyond it .
Jane Fairfax	""" Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out ."
Jane Fairfax	"but Jane Fairfax has them both , Harriet . """
Jane Fairfax	I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste .
Jane Fairfax	Besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach . The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family .
Jane Fairfax	I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer .
Jane Fairfax	""" She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be . "" "" She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there ."
Jane Fairfax	He sat by her at dinner .
Jane Fairfax	"Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him . "" "" Very likely.--I think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury . "" Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go with her ."
Jane Fairfax	Quite otherwise indeed , if I understood Miss Fairfax 's opinion last night .
Jane Fairfax	""" I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are-- "" "" Very well , I am much obliged to you ."
Jane Fairfax	My mother is delightfully well ; and Jane caught no cold last night .
Jane Fairfax	Jane said so .
Jane Fairfax	And it can not be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ? Only three of us.-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it .
Jane Fairfax	Jane came back delighted yesterday .
Jane Fairfax	Thank ye , the gloves do very well -- only a little too large about the wrist ; but Jane is taking them in .
Jane Fairfax	But I was really quite shocked the other day-- for Mr. Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock .
Jane Fairfax	So I begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same .
Jane Fairfax	And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me --
Jane Fairfax	for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could .
Jane Fairfax	I wanted to keep it from Jane 's knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware .
Jane Fairfax	""" More than an attachment , indeed , "" resumed Mrs. Weston ; "" an engagement-- a positive engagement.--What will you say , Emma -- what will any body say , when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged;--nay , that they have been long engaged ! """
Jane Fairfax	mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation .
Jane Fairfax	What!--engaged to her all the winter-- before either of them came to Highbury ?
Jane Fairfax	Jane actually on the point of going as governess !
Jane Fairfax	"To suffer her to engage herself-- to suffer her even to think of such a measure ! "" "" He knew nothing about it , Emma ."
Jane Fairfax	But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax , I never could , under any blunder , have spoken ill of her ; and as to speaking ill of him , there I must have been safe .
Jane Fairfax	It is not a connexion to gratify ; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that , why should we ?
Jane Fairfax	""" If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax's.--Of such , one may almost say , that ` the world is not their 's , nor the world 's law . '"
Jane Fairfax	Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls , she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton ; the whole system of whose treatment of her , by the bye , has ever filled me with indignation and hatred . I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known.-- ` Jane , ' indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you .
Jane Fairfax	, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever .
Jane Fairfax	"he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here . "" "" And I have not forgotten , "" said Emma , "" how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would ."
Jane Fairfax	"You never wrote a truer line . "" And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax 's sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , "" This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could . He should have respected even unreasonable scruples , had there been such ; but hers were all reasonable . We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment . "" Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party , and grew uncomfortable ."
Jane Fairfax	He has had great faults , faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness ; and I am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves : but still as he is , beyond a doubt , really attached to Miss Fairfax , and will soon , it may be hoped , have the advantage of being constantly with her , I am very ready to believe his character will improve , and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants .
Jane Fairfax	Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley 's marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of
Jane Fairfax	If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful.-- As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account .
Jane Fairfax	Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous.-- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted .
Jane Fairfax	No doubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane 's eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed .
Jane Fairfax	She understood it all ; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings , she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert . But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge !
Jane Fairfax	Did you ever hear any thing so strange ?
Jane Fairfax	he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while .
Jane Fairfax	""" Had you any idea , "" cried Harriet , "" of his being in love with her?--You , perhaps , might.--You ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body 's heart ; but nobody else--"
Jane Fairfax	Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly-- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr. Frank Churchill 's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax . You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly .
Jane Fairfax	Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits-- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _ compassion _ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now , ) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet 's hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right.-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost.-- Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves . Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight.--Emma 's tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet 's , but they were not less .
Jane Fairfax	Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became commonplace , threadbare , stale in the comparison , exciting no surprize , presenting no disparity , affording nothing to be said or thought.--Mr . Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an elevation on her side !
Jane Fairfax	""" Harriet , she found , had never in her life been within side the Vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , Emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with Mr. Elton 's seeing ready wit in her ."
Jane Fairfax	"After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again-- "" I do so wonder , Miss Woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married ! so charming as you are!""-- Emma laughed , and replied , "" My being charming , Harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; I must find other people charming -- one other person at least ."
Jane Fairfax	Fortune I do not want ; employment I do not want ; consequence I do not want : I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband 's house as I am of Hartfield ; and never , never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man 's eyes as I am in my father 's .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" But then , to be an old maid at last , like Miss Bates ! "" "" That is as formidable an image as you could present , Harriet ; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates !"
Jane Fairfax	""" Never mind , Harriet , I shall not be a poor old maid ; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public ! A single woman , with a very narrow income , must be a ridiculous , disagreeable old maid ! the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else ."
Jane Fairfax	And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first ; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind , and sour the temper .
Jane Fairfax	By the bye , _ that _ is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece .
Jane Fairfax	Every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month .
Jane Fairfax	"She understood their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little ; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good - will . In the present instance , it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit ; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice , she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet , as they walked away , "" These are the sights , Harriet , to do one good ."
Jane Fairfax	"The lane made a slight bend ; and when that bend was passed , Mr. Elton was immediately in sight ; and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther , "" Ah !"
Jane Fairfax	Well , ( smiling , ) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important .
Jane Fairfax	This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute . They did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield . To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her . She gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child 's pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them .
Jane Fairfax	Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage . The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner . She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it .
Jane Fairfax	It was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room . For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself .
Jane Fairfax	It could be protracted no longer . She was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance . The lovers were standing together at one of the windows . It had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully . But it would not do ; he had not come to the point . He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious .
Jane Fairfax	It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent , or so indignant ; he was not guided by _ her _ feelings in reprobating the ball , for _ she _ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree .
Jane Fairfax	Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball .
Jane Fairfax	It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of William Larkins .
Jane Fairfax	"Miss Woodhouse , why are you always so right ? """
Jane Fairfax	""" Indeed , I am very sorry to be right in this instance ."
Jane Fairfax	I would much rather have been merry than wise .
Jane Fairfax	""" Yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and I must be off immediately . I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him . "" "" Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates ?"
Jane Fairfax	""" In short , "" said he , "" perhaps , Miss Woodhouse -- I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion""-- He looked at her , as if wanting to read her thoughts ."
Jane Fairfax	She hardly knew what to say .
Jane Fairfax	"It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious , which she did not wish . Forcing herself to speak , therefore , in the hope of putting it by , she calmly said , "" You are quite in the right ; it was most natural to pay your visit , then""-- He was silent ."
Jane Fairfax	She believed he was looking at her ; probably reflecting on what she had said , and trying to understand the manner .
Jane Fairfax	She heard him sigh .
Jane Fairfax	He could not believe her to be encouraging him .
Jane Fairfax	"My regard for Hartfield is most warm""-- He stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed.-- He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ?"
Jane Fairfax	It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax , to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change ; but when they did meet , her composure was odious .
Jane Fairfax	She had been particularly unwell , however , suffering from headache to a degree , which made her aunt declare , that had the ball taken place , she did not think Jane could have attended it ; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill - health .
Jane Fairfax	The less worthy females were to come in the evening , with Miss Bates , Miss Fairfax , and Miss Smith ; but already , at dinner , they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general ; and , while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over , Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour .
Jane Fairfax	The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of Jane Fairfax .
Jane Fairfax	Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting . She listened , and found it well worth listening to .
Jane Fairfax	But Jane , it seems , had a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it .
Jane Fairfax	She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present .
Jane Fairfax	They might chuse to surprize her .
Jane Fairfax	""" I rather wonder that it was never made before . "" "" Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before . "" "" Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument-- which must now be shut up in London , untouched by any body . """
Jane Fairfax	"Jane Fairfax did look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend . In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her . She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte , she felt too much in the secret herself , to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair , and therefore purposely kept at a distance ; but by the others , the subject was almost immediately introduced , and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received , the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of "" my excellent friend Colonel Campbell . """
Jane Fairfax	"How else could they come ? "" "" Very true.--Well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now . And as I looked at her , though I never saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold ."
Jane Fairfax	Poor girl !
Jane Fairfax	He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax 's ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley .
Jane Fairfax	In short , I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax .
Jane Fairfax	"See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to it ? "" "" Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax ! "" exclaimed Emma ."
Jane Fairfax	"And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women ! """
Jane Fairfax	""" Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know . "" "" But the imprudence of such a match ! "" "" I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability ."
Jane Fairfax	He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax-- and is always glad to shew them attention .
Jane Fairfax	Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh ! no , no;--every feeling revolts .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" My dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax-- "" "" Nonsense !"
Jane Fairfax	He does not care about Jane Fairfax .
Jane Fairfax	"He would do any good to her , or her family ; but-- "" "" Well , "" said Mrs. Weston , laughing , "" perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give Jane such a respectable home ."
Jane Fairfax	""" If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion ."
Jane Fairfax	How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey , and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?-- ` So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour ! '
Jane Fairfax	I have heard him speak , and so must you , so very highly of Jane Fairfax !
Jane Fairfax	The interest he takes in her-- his anxiety about her health -- his concern that she should have no happier prospect !
Jane Fairfax	I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice !
Jane Fairfax	I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever . Oh !
Jane Fairfax	""" "" You take up an idea , Mrs. Weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . I see no sign of attachment-- I believe nothing of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax . """
Jane Fairfax	They sang together once more ; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own .
Jane Fairfax	A real injury to the children -- a most mortifying change , and material loss to them all;--a very great deduction from her father 's daily comfort -- and , as to herself , she could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey . A Mrs. Knightley for them all to give way to!--No -- Mr. Knightley must never marry .
Jane Fairfax	Towards the end of Jane 's second song , her voice grew thick .
Jane Fairfax	Miss Bates , in her real anxiety for Jane , could hardly stay even to be grateful , before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing .
Jane Fairfax	If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now , it might augur something .
Jane Fairfax	No ; he was talking to Mrs. Cole-- he was looking on unconcerned ; Jane was asked by somebody else , and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole . Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry ; his interest was yet safe ; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment .
Jane Fairfax	""" I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your 's ."
Jane Fairfax	""" What do you say to Mrs. Dixon ? "" "" Mrs. Dixon ! very true indeed ."
Jane Fairfax	I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon .
Jane Fairfax	She must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman 's scheme than an elderly man 's .
Jane Fairfax	It is Mrs. Dixon , I dare say .
Jane Fairfax	Yes , I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon .
Jane Fairfax	"We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance . "" "" Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I can not help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend ,"
Jane Fairfax	he had the misfortune to fall in love with _ her _ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side
Jane Fairfax	One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland .
Jane Fairfax	Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment .
Jane Fairfax	As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body 's native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ?
Jane Fairfax	Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and I dare say in her 's .
Jane Fairfax	Mr. Dixon 's preference of her music to her friend 's , I can answer for being very decided .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" And then , he saved her life ."
Jane Fairfax	Did you ever hear of that?-- A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard .
Jane Fairfax	He caught her .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" He did ."
Jane Fairfax	I dare say you would ; but I , simple I , saw nothing but the fact , that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her.--It
Jane Fairfax	we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon .
Jane Fairfax	Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells , or they would have been guessed at first .
Jane Fairfax	She would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them .
Jane Fairfax	I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business .
Jane Fairfax	"But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . "" There was no occasion to press the matter farther . The conviction seemed real ; he looked as if he felt it . She said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes . The ladies had not been long in the drawing - room , before the other ladies , in their different divisions , arrived ."
Jane Fairfax	Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend ; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace , she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner , but could most heartily rejoice in that light , cheerful , unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure , in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection . There she sat -- and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding ?
Jane Fairfax	Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax ; but it was most prudent to avoid speech .
Jane Fairfax	""" I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that I can not keep my eyes from her ."
Jane Fairfax	I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her own .
Jane Fairfax	I see nobody else looking like her!-- I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion .
Jane Fairfax	"Yes , I will -- I declare I will -- and you shall see how she takes it;-- whether she colours . """
Jane Fairfax	He was gone immediately ; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of Miss Fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing . Before he could return to his chair , it was taken by Mrs. Weston .
Jane Fairfax	Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here ?
Jane Fairfax	Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh ! no , no;--every feeling revolts .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so . "" "" There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma . I have a very strong notion that it comes from him ."
Jane Fairfax	Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr. Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .
Jane Fairfax	They sang together once more ; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own .
Jane Fairfax	""" "" Yes , "" he replied , and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.-- "" But they would have done better had they given her notice of it ."
Jane Fairfax	""" One more;--they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account , and would only ask for one more . """
Jane Fairfax	Here ceased the concert part of the evening , for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers ; but soon ( within five minutes ) the proposal of dancing-- originating nobody exactly knew where -- was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole , that every thing was rapidly clearing away , to give proper space .
Miss Bates	According to Miss Bates -- it all came from her -- Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly .
Miss Bates	After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates , and Mrs. Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .
Miss Bates	Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect .
Miss Bates	She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness .
Miss Bates	Her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible .
Miss Bates	And yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will .
Miss Bates	It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders .
Miss Bates	She loved every body , was interested in every body 's happiness , quicksighted to every body 's merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature , and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother , and so many good neighbours and friends , and a home that wanted for nothing .
Miss Bates	The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself .
Miss Bates	She was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip .
Miss Bates	Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School -- not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems -- and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity -- but a real , honest , old - fashioned Boarding - school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies .
Miss Bates	Mrs. Goddard 's school was in high repute -- and very deservedly ; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands .
Miss Bates	It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church .
Miss Bates	She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse 's kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside . These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father 's sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston .
Miss Bates	As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty . A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion .
Miss Bates	It would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers .
Miss Bates	She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware .
Miss Bates	With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively , with the real good - will of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did she then do all the honours of the meal , and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters , with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests .
Miss Bates	"Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say : "" Mrs. Bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs ."
Miss Bates	Miss Bates , let Emma help you to a _ little _ bit of tart -- a _ very _ little bit .
Miss Bates	You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here .
Miss Bates	They are not far off . Shall I call upon them ? Or Miss Bates ?
Miss Bates	She is still nearer.-- And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body .
Miss Bates	Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us ?
Miss Bates	""" "" Well -- if you please , "" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating , "" if you think she will be of any use . "" "" You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates , "" said Emma ."
Miss Bates	""" She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing ."
Miss Bates	She will not even listen to your questions .
Miss Bates	I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates .
Miss Bates	""" "" But she is so amusing , so extremely amusing !"
Miss Bates	I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk .
Miss Bates	""" Aye , do , Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us end the matter at once"
Miss Bates	She will enjoy the scheme , I am sure ; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties .
Miss Bates	Fetch Miss Bates .
Miss Bates	She is a standing lesson of how to be happy .
Miss Bates	"I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece . "" "" Oh !"
Miss Bates	Long before he reappeared , attending the short , neat , brisk - moving aunt , and her elegant niece,--Mrs . Weston , like a sweet - tempered woman and a good wife , had examined the passage again , and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before-- indeed very trifling ; and here ended the difficulties of decision .
Miss Bates	Most cordially , when Miss Bates arrived , did she agree that it must . As a counsellor she was not wanted ; but as an approver , ( a much safer character , ) she was truly welcome .
Miss Bates	Her approbation , at once general and minute , warm and incessant , could not but please ; and for another half - hour they were all walking to and fro , between the different rooms , some suggesting , some attending , and all in happy enjoyment of the future .
Miss Bates	"It would be a _ secret _ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate . She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.-- The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name.-- She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , "" Beg her to walk up;""--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging ."
Miss Bates	Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates , Mr. Knightley , as I told you before .
Miss Bates	Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax 's situation with Mr. Knightley.-- Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it might have happened at a better time -- and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them half an hour , she found .
Miss Bates	Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter .
Miss Bates	To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name-- mentioning that she had Mr. Perry 's decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient .
Miss Bates	In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs. Bates 's , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her-- but it would not do;--Miss
Miss Bates	Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried-- but all in vain .
Miss Bates	Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ;
Miss Bates	Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons , the Mrs. Perrys , and the Mrs. Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself-- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece 's appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing:-- Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful .
Miss Bates	There was not a dissentient voice on the subject , either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates , or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit .
Miss Bates	How the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill.--She was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more . In this state Frank Churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , they loud and insolent . By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment . The pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward , and leave his horses to meet him by another road , a mile or two beyond Highbury-- and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates , and to have forgotten to restore them , he had been obliged to stop at her door , and go in for a few minutes : he was therefore later than he had intended ; and being on foot , was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them . The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion .
Miss Bates	They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates .
Miss Bates	There was always sufficient reason for such an attention ; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called on , and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her , as rather negligent in that respect , and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts . She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart , as to her deficiency -- but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time -- tiresome women-- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second - rate and third - rate of Highbury , who were calling on them for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them .
Miss Bates	Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied the drawing - room floor ; and there , in the very moderate - sized apartment , which was every thing to them , the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed ; the quiet neat old lady , who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse , and her more active , talking daughter ,
Miss Bates	""" All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath ; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax 's handwriting ."
Miss Bates	""" You are extremely kind , "" replied Miss Bates , highly gratified ; "" you who are such a judge , and write so beautifully yourself ."
Miss Bates	I am sure there is nobody 's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse 's .
Miss Bates	My mother does not hear ; she is a little deaf you know .
Miss Bates	And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it .
Miss Bates	"She was pondering , in the meanwhile , upon the possibility , without seeming very rude , of making her escape from Jane Fairfax 's letter , and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse , when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention . "" My mother 's deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all ."
Miss Bates	Emma and Harriet went together ; Miss Bates and her niece , with the Eltons ; the gentlemen on horseback .
Miss Bates	The Eltons walked together ; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill .
Miss Bates	Miss Bates said a great deal ; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse 's presiding ; Mr. Knightley 's answer was the most distinct .
Miss Bates	"very well , "" exclaimed Miss Bates , "" then I need not be uneasy ."
Miss Bates	That will just do for me , you know .
Miss Bates	I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth , sha n't I ?
Miss Bates	"( looking round with the most good - humoured dependence on every body 's assent)--Do not you all think I shall ? """
Miss Bates	""" Ah ! ma'am , but there may be a difficulty ."
Miss Bates	"Pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once . """
Miss Bates	Miss Bates , deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner , did not immediately catch her meaning ; but , when it burst on her , it could not anger , though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her .
Miss Bates	Yes , I see what she means , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) and I will try to hold my tongue .
Miss Bates	I must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend .
Miss Bates	""" "" I like your plan , "" cried Mr. Weston ."
Miss Bates	Miss Woodhouse must excuse me .
Miss Bates	I am not one of those who have witty things at every body 's service .
Miss Bates	I do not pretend to be a wit .
Miss Bates	I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue .
Miss Bates	Pass Mr. E. , Knightley , Jane , and myself .
Miss Bates	""" Now , ma'am , "" said Jane to her aunt , "" shall we join Mrs. Elton ? "" "" If you please , my dear ."
Miss Bates	How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates ?
Miss Bates	How could she have been so brutal , so cruel to Miss Bates !
Miss Bates	How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued ! And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude , of concurrence , of common kindness ! Time did not compose her .
Miss Bates	They had stopped at Mrs. Bates 's door to offer the use of their carriage , but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons .
Miss Bates	""" But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax ! "" said Mr. Weston , looking about ."
Miss Bates	"In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.-- "" I will see that there are umbrellas , sir , "" said Frank to his father : "" Miss Bates must not be forgotten : "" and away he went ."
Miss Bates	""" I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane ."
Miss Bates	Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs. Weston 's to receive them .
Miss Bates	"Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma ; but her words , every body 's words , were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates , who came in talking , and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire . As the door opened she was heard , "" So very obliging of you!--No rain at all ."
Miss Bates	I do not care for myself .
Miss Bates	And Jane declares-- Well!--(as soon as she was within the door ) Well !
Miss Bates	Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma ; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her.--He was thoughtful .
Miss Bates	Whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine .
Miss Bates	""" Me!--oh ! no -- I would get you a better partner than myself ."
Miss Bates	"I am no dancer . """
Miss Bates	""" If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance , "" said he , "" I shall have great pleasure , I am sure -- for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert ."
Miss Bates	""" Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- Miss Smith . """
Miss Bates	The move began ; and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment , without interruption , till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon .
Miss Bates	Miss Bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick .
Miss Bates	However , she is very agreeable , and Mrs. Bates too , in a different way .
Miss Bates	"He had time only to say , "" No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls , "" when the door was thrown open , and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room . Full of thanks , and full of news , Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest ."
Miss Bates	my dear sir , how are you this morning ?
Miss Bates	""" But where could _ you _ hear it ? "" cried Miss Bates ."
Miss Bates	"We were always glad to see him at Hartfield . "" "" A new neighbour for us all , Miss Woodhouse ! "" said Miss Bates , joyfully ; "" my mother is so pleased!--she says she can not bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress ."
Miss Bates	""" My father would say ` yes , ' Mr. Knightley ` no ; ' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium ."
Miss Bates	"And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off . "" "" Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse , "" said Miss Bates , "" four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs. Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man -- but'--In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries ."
Miss Bates	I do not pretend to it .
Miss Bates	What is before me , I see .
Miss Bates	At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired -- Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly .
Miss Bates	She knows I would not offend for the world .
Miss Bates	"If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning to rain , Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs. Goddard 's , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation . The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the "" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened ! "" which instantly burst forth , had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation ."
Miss Bates	"If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning to rain , Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs. Goddard 's , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation . The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the "" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened ! "" which instantly burst forth , had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation ."
Miss Bates	Emma and Harriet were going to walk ; he joined them ; and , on returning , they fell in with a larger party , who , like themselves , judged it wisest to take their exercise early , as the weather threatened rain ; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son , Miss Bates and her niece , who had accidentally met .
Miss Bates	The Randalls party agreed to it immediately ; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates , which few persons listened to , she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse 's most obliging invitation .
Miss Bates	""" Why , to own the truth , "" cried Miss Bates , who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes , "" if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days ."
Miss Bates	Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed .
Miss Bates	Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of .
Miss Bates	Mr. Knightley 's eyes had preceded Miss Bates 's in a glance at Jane .
Miss Bates	The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs. Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury;--to Hartfield of course . They were stopping , however , in the first place at Mrs. Bates 's ; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford 's ; and had all but knocked , when Emma caught their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her ; and the agreeableness of yesterday 's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting .
Miss Bates	""" For my companion tells me , "" said she , "" that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning ."
Miss Bates	""" And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope , "" said Frank Churchill , "" to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield-- if you are going home ."
Miss Bates	""" Emma would be "" very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates , & c. , "" and they did at last move out of the shop , with no farther delay from Miss Bates than , "" How do you do , Mrs. Ford ?"
Miss Bates	I beg your pardon . I did not see you before .
Miss Bates	I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town .
Miss Bates	""" What was I talking of ? "" said she , beginning again when they were all in the street ."
Miss Bates	"Emma wondered on what , of all the medley , she would fix . """
Miss Bates	I declare I can not recollect what I was talking of.--Oh !
Miss Bates	my mother 's spectacles .
Miss Bates	Matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter 's marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield .
Miss Bates	"I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two . "" "" Especially when _ one _ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature ! "" said Emma playfully ."
Miss Bates	"Mr. Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body . "" Emma knows I never flatter her , "" said Mr. Knightley , "" but I meant no reflection on any body . Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one ."
Miss Bates	The chances are that she must be a gainer .
Miss Bates	""" "" Well , "" said Emma , willing to let it pass--""you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly ."
Miss Bates	Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen .
Miss Bates	Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day .
Miss Bates	""" But , Mr. Knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am sure she _ will _ miss her more than she thinks for . """
Miss Bates	""" We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor 's advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor 's time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore can not allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married . "" "" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me , "" said Emma , "" and a very considerable one -- that I made the match myself . I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing . "" Mr. Knightley shook his head at her ."
Miss Bates	my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass .
Miss Bates	Ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell 's , I made up my mind on the subject .
Miss Bates	""" "" With a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time , "" said Mr. Knightley , laughing , "" and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing . Invite him to dinner , Emma , and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken , but leave him to chuse his own wife ."
Miss Bates	""" Yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and I must be off immediately . I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him . "" "" Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates ?"
Miss Bates	Miss Bates 's powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours .
Miss Bates	I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates 's being absent .
Miss Bates	She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in . She is a woman that one may , that one _ must _ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight .
Miss Bates	Her father 's comfort was amply secured , Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs. Goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it .
Miss Bates	Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates , and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte -- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand , but a large - sized square pianoforte ; and the substance of the story , the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations on her side , and explanations on Miss Bates 's , was , that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood 's the day before , to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at first , by Miss Bates 's account , Jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it-- but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell .
Miss Bates	""" That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs. Bates 's house . """
Miss Bates	In he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece , made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle , where sat Miss Woodhouse ; and till he could find a seat by her , would not sit at all .
Miss Bates	Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here ?
Miss Bates	You may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , I made my way directly to Miss Bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once .
Miss Bates	she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure .
Miss Bates	` Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many , many thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us , for Mr. Knightley 's carriage had brought , and was to take them home again
Miss Bates	""" Well , "" said Mrs. Weston , smiling , "" you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again . The more I think of it , the more probable it appears ."
Miss Bates	How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey , and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?-- ` So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour ! '
Miss Bates	And then fly off , through half a sentence , to her mother 's old petticoat .
Miss Bates	"` Not that it was such a very old petticoat either -- for still it would last a great while -- and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong . ' "" "" For shame , Emma ! Do not mimic her . You divert me against my conscience . And , upon my word , I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates ."
Miss Bates	She might talk on ; and if he wanted to say any thing himself , he would only talk louder , and drown her voice .
Miss Bates	"And touching Miss Bates , who at that moment passed near--""Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ?"
Miss Bates	Miss Bates , in her real anxiety for Jane , could hardly stay even to be grateful , before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing .
Miss Bates	It was growing late , and Miss Bates became anxious to get home , on her mother 's account .
George Knightley	"We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to . "" "" You are right , Mrs. Weston , "" said Mr. Knightley warmly , "" Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton ."
George Knightley	Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance ; and she was herself struck by his warmth .
George Knightley	""" And yet , "" said Emma , beginning hastily and with an arch look , but soon stopping -- it was better , however , to know the worst at once-- she hurried on--""And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is ."
George Knightley	"The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other . "" Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of getting them together , or some other cause , brought the colour into his face , as he answered , "" Oh ! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand ."
George Knightley	"Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago . """
George Knightley	He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston , and did not herself know what to think .
George Knightley	"In a moment he went on-- "" That will never be , however , I can assure you ."
George Knightley	"Miss Fairfax , I dare say , would not have me if I were to ask her -- and I am very sure I shall never ask her . """
George Knightley	"Emma returned her friend 's pressure with interest ; and was pleased enough to exclaim , "" You are not vain , Mr. Knightley ."
George Knightley	"I will say that for you . "" He seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased"
George Knightley	", soon afterwards said , "" So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ? """
George Knightley	You have scolded me too much for match - making , for me to presume to take such a liberty with you .
George Knightley	no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body .
George Knightley	"You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married . "" Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again ."
George Knightley	"The result of his reverie was , "" No , Emma , I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way , I assure you . """
George Knightley	She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do for Mr. Cole ? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . Mrs. Weston , your argument weighs most with me . I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax 's mind over Mrs. Elton . I have no faith in Mrs. Elton 's acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding .
George Knightley	""" "" Jane Fairfax has feeling , "" said Mr. Knightley--""I do not accuse her of want of feeling ."
George Knightley	Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness .
George Knightley	She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be -- And I love an open temper .
George Knightley	No -- till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head .
George Knightley	I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond .
George Knightley	""" Well , Mrs. Weston , "" said Emma triumphantly when he left them , "" what do you say now to Mr. Knightley 's marrying Jane Fairfax ?"
George Knightley	""" Why , really , dear Emma , I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _ not _ being in love with her , that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last ."
George Knightley	VII Emma 's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day , by hearing that he was gone off to London , merely to have his hair cut . A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast , and he had sent for a chaise and set off , intending to return to dinner , but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut .
George Knightley	There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand ; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve .
George Knightley	It did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday . Vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges .
George Knightley	"His father only called him a coxcomb , and thought it a very good story ; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it , was clear enough , by her passing it over as quickly as possible , and making no other comment than that "" all young people would have their little whims . """
George Knightley	With the exception of this little blot , Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him .
George Knightley	Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether . He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect .
George Knightley	This was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference-- ( for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance .
George Knightley	Mr. Weston , on his side , added a virtue to the account which must have some weight . He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly .
George Knightley	"As Mrs. Weston observed , "" all young people would have their little whims . "" There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry , not so leniently disposed . In general he was judged , throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man-- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr. Knightley ."
George Knightley	"The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , "" Hum ! just the trifling , silly fellow I took him for . """
George Knightley	She had half a mind to resent ; but an instant 's observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass . Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr. and Mrs. Weston 's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune .
George Knightley	"However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr. Knightley too , to take care of her , I can not wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy . """
George Knightley	"With this treatment , Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual . "" He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard ."
George Knightley	He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her .
George Knightley	You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ ten _ years .
George Knightley	"You must promise me not to sit up . "" He did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual ."
George Knightley	XII Till now that she was threatened with its loss , Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _ first _ with Mr. Knightley , first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been.--Long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella .
George Knightley	She had herself been first with him for many years past .
George Knightley	She had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared . In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .
George Knightley	Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly , exclusively , passionately loved by Mr. Knightley . _ She _ could not .
George Knightley	She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _ her _ .
George Knightley	She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.-- How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates ! How directly , how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not
George Knightley	too strongly for the offence -- but far , far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear - sighted goodwill.-- She had no hope , nothing to deserve the name of hope , that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question ; but there was a hope ( at times a slight one , at times much stronger , ) that Harriet might have deceived herself , and be overrating his regard for _ her_.--Wish it she must , for his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself , but his remaining single all his life . Could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father , the same Mr. Knightley to all the world ; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured.--Marriage , in fact , would not do for her .
George Knightley	She would not marry , even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley .
George Knightley	It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- He was expected back every day . The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course .
George Knightley	A little curiosity Emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related .
George Knightley	But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before .
George Knightley	The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been-- that had been -- hard for him to bear . ` I did not make the allowances , ' said she , ` which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits-- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first . ' She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good . She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself .
George Knightley	"I am sure she is very good-- I hope she will be very happy . It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers . "" Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston . She thought well of Frank in almost every respect ; and , what was more , she loved him very much , and her defence was , therefore , earnest . She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection-- but she had too much to urge for Emma 's attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs. Weston ended with , "" We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come , "" she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for . "" Are you well , my Emma ? "" was Mrs. Weston 's parting question ."
George Knightley	She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause . Had she followed Mr. Knightley 's known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now.--Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax 's confidence on this important matter-- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane 's feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill 's .
George Knightley	It reminded her of their first forlorn tete - a - tete , on the evening of Mrs. Weston 's wedding - day ; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then , soon after tea , and dissipated every melancholy fancy .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!-- No longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their's!--How was it to be endured ? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet 's sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in Harriet 's society all that he wanted ; if Harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing Emma 's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ? When it came to such a pitch as this , she was not able to refrain from a start , or a heavy sigh , or even from walking about the room for a few seconds -- and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn , was in the resolution of her own better conduct , and the hope that , however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past , it would yet find her more rational , more acquainted with herself , and leave her less to regret when it were gone .
George Knightley	Fortunately for him , Highbury , including Randalls in the same parish , and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of Mr. Knightley , comprehended many such .
George Knightley	Not unfrequently , through Emma 's persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card - table for him . Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; and by Mr. Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse 's drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away .
George Knightley	They were a family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell -- very creditably , she believed -- she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect . _
George Knightley	"They seem not able to do any thing without him.--`Upon my word , Mr. E. , ' I often say , ` rather you than I.-- I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if I had half so many applicants . '--Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.--However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all . "" And putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma--""A congratulatory visit , you know.--Oh ! yes , quite indispensable . "" Miss Bates looked about her , so happily!-- "" He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley ; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.--Mr"
George Knightley	". E. is Knightley 's right hand . """
George Knightley	Weston and Cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way
George Knightley	"When I got to Donwell , "" said he , "" Knightley could not be found ."
George Knightley	"after the note I sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one . """
George Knightley	""" "" No , no , that 's to - morrow ; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to - day on"
George Knightley	And then not to find him at home !
George Knightley	The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.-- Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone .
George Knightley	"Perhaps to Hartfield , perhaps to the Abbey Mill , perhaps into his woods.-- Miss Woodhouse , this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain it ? """
George Knightley	"I can not imagine , "" said Mrs. Elton , ( feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do , ) "" I can not imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world !"
George Knightley	The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E. , he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;-- and his servants forgot it .
George Knightley	Depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants , who are all , I have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration . And as for Mrs. Hodges , Wright holds her very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt , and never sent it .
George Knightley	""" "" I met William Larkins , "" continued Mr. Elton , "" as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him.--William"
George Knightley	He did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him .
George Knightley	"I have nothing to do with William 's wants , but it really is of very great importance that _ I _ should see Knightley to - day ; and it becomes a matter , therefore , of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose . """
George Knightley	In all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr. Elton , if not towards William Larkins .
George Knightley	She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her . It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit .
George Knightley	Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not .
George Knightley	It was settled so , upon the hill , while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley .
George Knightley	""" Mr. Knightley was there too , was he ? """
George Knightley	""" No , not Mr. Knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though I thought he would come , because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him off , he did not;--but my mother , and Jane , and I , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had ."
George Knightley	"Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence , and were sitting with her father.--Mr . Knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said , "" I would not go away without seeing you , but I have no time to spare , and therefore must now be gone directly ."
George Knightley	I am going to London , to spend a few days with John and Isabella .
George Knightley	""" Yes -- rather -- I have been thinking of it some little time . """
George Knightley	Emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself . Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again . While he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going-- her father began his inquiries .
George Knightley	Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates , Mr. Knightley , as I told you before .
George Knightley	It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour , as if his eyes received the truth from her 's , and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.-- He looked at her with a glow of regard .
George Knightley	She was warmly gratified-- and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;-- whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say-- she might , perhaps , have rather offered it -- but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips-- when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done ,
George Knightley	she could not perceive.--He would have judged better , she thought ,
George Knightley	if he had not stopped.--The intention , however , was indubitable ;
George Knightley	whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more.-- It was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature.-- She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction .
George Knightley	It spoke such perfect amity.--He left them immediately afterwards-- gone in a moment . He always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory , but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance .
George Knightley	Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax 's situation with Mr. Knightley.-- Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it might have happened at a better time -- and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them half an hour , she found .
George Knightley	In the hope of diverting her father 's thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley 's going to London ; and going so suddenly ; and going on horseback , which she knew would be all very bad ; Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax , and her dependence on the effect was justified ; it supplied a very useful check,-- interested , without disturbing him .
George Knightley	He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax 's going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr. Knightley 's going to London had been an unexpected blow .
George Knightley	Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove .
George Knightley	Mrs. Weston 's friends were all made happy by her safety ; and if the satisfaction of her well - doing could be increased to Emma , it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl . She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston . She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her , hereafter , with either of Isabella 's sons ; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best .
George Knightley	It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston , as he grew older-- and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense , the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home ; and Mrs. Weston-- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her ; and it
George Knightley	""" She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me , "" she continued--""like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis ' Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan ."
George Knightley	""" That is , "" replied Mr. Knightley , "" she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all . It will be the only difference ."
George Knightley	""" Poor child ! "" cried Emma ; "" at that rate , what will become of her ? """
George Knightley	She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older . I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma .
George Knightley	It was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me?-- and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner .
George Knightley	"And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen . "" "" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks--`Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor 's leave'--something which , you knew , I did not approve ."
George Knightley	In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one .
George Knightley	""" What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance . "" "" ` Mr. Knightley . '--You always called me , ` Mr. Knightley ; ' and , from habit , it has not so very formal"
George Knightley	I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what .
George Knightley	""" And can not you call me ` George ' now ? "" "" Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but ` Mr. Knightley . ' I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton , by calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise , "" she added presently , laughing and blushing--""I will promise to call you once by your Christian name . I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better , for worse . "" Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith ; but it was too tender a subject.--She"
George Knightley	This , on his side , might merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their friendship were declining .
George Knightley	He might observe that it was so .
George Knightley	The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy .
George Knightley	Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .
George Knightley	""" John does not even mention your friend , "" said Mr. Knightley ."
George Knightley	""" Here is his answer , if you like to see it . "" It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage ."
George Knightley	Emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned .
George Knightley	""" John enters like a brother into my happiness , "" continued Mr. Knightley , "" but he is no complimenter ; and though I well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise . But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes ."
George Knightley	""" "" Ah ! "" he cried , "" I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together ."
George Knightley	""" "" If I understand your brother , he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying ."
George Knightley	As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse 's visits , Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause , resolved first to announce it at home , and then at Randalls.-- But how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself to do it , in such an hour of Mr. Knightley 's absence , or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her , and she must have put it off ; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time , and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced to speak , and to speak cheerfully too . She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself .
George Knightley	She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all-- she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person 's company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston , best in the world . Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it .
George Knightley	Emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston , whose marriages taking them from Hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from Hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?-- He would not deny that he did , she was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him?-- Who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why could not they go on as they had done ?
George Knightley	Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--
George Knightley	To Emma 's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley 's , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion.-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs. Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one--
George Knightley	well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse 's mind.--It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other-- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place . Mrs. Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield ! And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable!-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband 's plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma .
George Knightley	"How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment -- less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than by herself -- but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying--""Those matters will take care of themselves ; the young people will find a way . """
George Knightley	Mrs. Weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world .
George Knightley	If any thing could increase her delight , it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps .
George Knightley	The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread ; and Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it ; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--
George Knightley	"He saw the advantages of the match , and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife ; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing ; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it . "" It is to be a secret , I conclude , "" said he ."
George Knightley	""" These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them . Only let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion . "" He went to Highbury the next morning , and satisfied himself on that point ."
George Knightley	He told her the news .
George Knightley	Was not she like a daughter , his eldest daughter?--he must tell her ; and Miss Bates being present , it passed , of course , to Mrs. Cole , Mrs. Perry , and Mrs. Elton , immediately afterwards . It was no more than the principals were prepared for ; they had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls , how soon it would be over Highbury ; and were thinking of themselves , as the evening wonder in many a family circle , with great sagacity .
George Knightley	Some might think him , and others might think her , the most in luck . One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell , and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys ; and another might predict disagreements among their servants ; but yet , upon the whole , there was no serious objection raised , except in one habitation , the Vicarage.--There , the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction .
George Knightley	"Mr. Elton cared little about it , compared with his wife ; he only hoped "" the young lady 's pride would now be contented ; "" and supposed "" she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ; "" and , on the point of living at Hartfield , could daringly exclaim , "" Rather he than I!""-- But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--""Poor Knightley !"
George Knightley	poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She
George Knightley	was extremely concerned ; for , though very eccentric , he had a thousand good qualities.--
George Knightley	How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love-- not in the least.--Poor
George Knightley	would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him ! But that would be all over now.--
George Knightley	Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _ her _ .
George Knightley	""" I remember once calling you ` George , ' in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago . I did it because I thought it would offend you ; but , as you made no objection , I never did it again ."
George Knightley	""" And can not you call me ` George ' now ? "" "" Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but ` Mr. Knightley . ' I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton , by calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise , "" she added presently , laughing and blushing--""I will promise to call you once by your Christian name . I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better , for worse . "" Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith ; but it was too tender a subject.--She"
George Knightley	The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs. Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte . Busy as he was , however , the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again .
George Knightley	""" This is a pleasure , "" said he , in rather a low voice , "" coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated . You find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think I shall succeed . "" "" What ! "" said Mrs. Weston , "" have not you finished it yet ?"
George Knightley	you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate .
George Knightley	""" "" I have not been working uninterruptedly , "" he replied , "" I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe ."
George Knightley	He contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again .
George Knightley	""" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ , "" said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , "" the person has not chosen ill ."
George Knightley	I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell 's taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _ all _ _ that _ _ party _ would particularly prize .
George Knightley	I dare say , Miss Fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to Broadwood himself .
George Knightley	"Do not distress her . "" He shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy . Soon afterwards he began again , "" How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , Miss Fairfax ."
George Knightley	I dare say they often think of you , and wonder which will be the day , the precise day of the instrument 's coming to hand .
George Knightley	"Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ? "" He paused . She could not but hear ; she could not avoid answering , "" Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell , "" said she , in a voice of forced calmness , "" I can imagine nothing with any confidence ."
George Knightley	I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm .
George Knightley	What nonsense one talks , Miss Woodhouse , when hard at work , if one talks at all;--your real workmen , I suppose , hold their tongues ; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word -- Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing .
George Knightley	I have the pleasure , madam , ( to Mrs. Bates , ) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present .
George Knightley	""" He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged Miss Fairfax , who was still sitting at it , to play something more . """
George Knightley	"If you are very kind , "" said he , "" it will be one of the waltzes we danced"
George Knightley	last night;--let me live them over again
George Knightley	"You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time . I believe you were glad we danced no longer ; but I would have given worlds-- all the worlds one ever has to give -- for another half - hour . """
George Knightley	"She looked up at him for a moment , coloured deeply , and played something else . He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte , and turning to Emma , said , "" Here is something quite new to me . Do you know it?--Cramer.--"
George Knightley	Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell , was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here . I honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart .
George Knightley	""" Emma wished he would be less pointed , yet could not help being amused ; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile , when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness , there had been a smile of secret delight , she had less scruple in the amusement , and much less compunction with respect to her.--This amiable , upright , perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings ."
George Knightley	"He brought all the music to her , and they looked it over together.-- Emma took the opportunity of whispering , "" You speak too plain ."
George Knightley	""" I am very glad you did , and that you communicated it to me . I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways ."
George Knightley	""" "" I do not see much sign of it . She is playing _ Robin _ _ Adair _ at this moment--_his _ favourite . """
George Knightley	Shortly afterwards Miss Bates , passing near the window , descried Mr. Knightley on horse - back not far off .
George Knightley	""" Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible , just to thank him ."
George Knightley	I will not open the window here ; it would give you all cold ; but I can go into my mother 's room you know .
George Knightley	I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here .
George Knightley	She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke , and opening the casement there , immediately called Mr. Knightley 's attention , and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others , as if it had passed within the same apartment .
George Knightley	well , I thank you .
George Knightley	So obliged to you for the carriage last night . We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us .
George Knightley	"So began Miss Bates ; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn , for most resolutely and commandingly did he say , "" How is your niece , Miss Bates?--I"
George Knightley	How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no cold last night .
George Knightley	"Tell me how Miss Fairfax is . """
George Knightley	And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else .
George Knightley	"The listeners were amused ; and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning . But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism . "" So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage , "" resumed Miss Bates . He cut her short with , "" I am going to Kingston . Can I do any thing for you ?"
George Knightley	"dear , Kingston -- are you?--Mrs . Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston . """
George Knightley	"Can I do any thing for _ you _ ? """
George Knightley	""" No , I thank you ."
George Knightley	Who do you think is here?-- Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith ; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte .
George Knightley	Do put up your horse at the Crown , and come in .
George Knightley	""" Well , "" said he , in a deliberating manner , "" for five minutes , perhaps . """
George Knightley	""" No , not now , I thank you ."
George Knightley	I could not stay two minutes .
George Knightley	"I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can . "" "" Oh !"
George Knightley	They will be so very happy to see you .
George Knightley	""" No , no ; your room is full enough ."
George Knightley	"I will call another day , and hear the pianoforte . "" "" Well , I am so sorry!--Oh ! Mr. Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?-- Was not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it . "" "" Oh !"
George Knightley	very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes .
George Knightley	And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too . I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England .
George Knightley	Now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but I can not stay to hear it .
George Knightley	""" "" Oh ! Mr. Knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence-- so shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples !"
George Knightley	""" "" What is the matter now ? "" "" To think of your sending us all your store apples . You said you had a great many , and now you have not one left . We really are so shocked !"
George Knightley	You should not have done it , indeed you should not .
George Knightley	But I thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned .
George Knightley	Well , ( returning to the room , ) I have not been able to succeed .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley can not stop .
George Knightley	He is going to Kingston .
George Knightley	"He asked me if he could do any thing . . . . "" "" Yes , "" said Jane , "" we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing . "" "" Oh !"
George Knightley	yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr. Knightley spoke loud .
George Knightley	` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ? ' said he ; so I just mentioned . . . .
George Knightley	She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on Mr. Perry 's coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery.--There
George Knightley	, with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her.--It was the first intimation of his being returned from London .
George Knightley	She had been thinking of him the moment before , as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.--There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind .
George Knightley	She asked after their mutual friends ; they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only that morning .
George Knightley	He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with her , she found .
George Knightley	""" He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors . ""--She thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully ; and the first possible cause for it , suggested by her fears , was , that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother , and was pained by the manner in which they had been received ."
George Knightley	He was silent .
George Knightley	She thought he was often looking at her , and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give . And this belief produced another dread .
George Knightley	Perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to Harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject .
George Knightley	He must do it all himself .
George Knightley	With him it was most unnatural .
George Knightley	"She considered -- resolved -- and , trying to smile , began-- "" You have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you . "" "" Have I ? "" said he quietly , and looking at her ; "" of what nature ? "" "" Oh ! the best nature in the world -- a wedding . """
George Knightley	"After waiting a moment , as if to be sure she intended to say no more , he replied , "" If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already . """
George Knightley	""" How is it possible ? "" cried Emma , turning her glowing cheeks towards him ; for , while she spoke , it occurred to her that he might have called at Mrs. Goddard 's in his way ."
George Knightley	I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened .
George Knightley	"Emma was quite relieved , and could presently say , with a little more composure , "" _ You _ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it -- but--(with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness . """
George Knightley	"For a moment or two nothing was said , and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest , till she found her arm drawn within his , and pressed against his heart , and heard him thus saying , in a tone of great sensibility , speaking low , "" Time , my dearest Emma , time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your father 's sake -- I know you will not allow yourself-- . """
George Knightley	"Her arm was pressed again , as he added , in a more broken and subdued accent , "" The feelings of the warmest friendship -- Indignation -- Abominable scoundrel!""-- And in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded with , "" He will soon be gone ."
George Knightley	I am sorry for _ her _ .
George Knightley	"Emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied , "" You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right.-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion ."
George Knightley	My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier .
George Knightley	""" "" Emma ! "" cried he , looking eagerly at her , "" are you , indeed?""-- but checking himself--""No , no , I understand you -- forgive me -- I am pleased that you can say even so much.--He"
George Knightley	and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!--I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt-- I could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?-- Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature .
George Knightley	""" "" Mr. Knightley , "" said Emma , trying to be lively , but really confused-- "" I am in a very extraordinary situation ."
George Knightley	I can not let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.-- But I never have .
George Knightley	He listened in perfect silence . She wished him to speak , but he
George Knightley	.
George Knightley	She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion .
George Knightley	She went on , however .
George Knightley	She had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought .
George Knightley	"At last , and tolerably in his usual tone , he said , "" I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose , however , that I may have underrated him ."
George Knightley	"My acquaintance with him has been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has a chance.--I have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well . "" "" I have no doubt of their being happy together , "" said Emma ; "" I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached ."
George Knightley	""" "" He is a most fortunate man ! "" returned Mr. Knightley , with energy ."
George Knightley	What years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him!--Assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for Jane Fairfax 's character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour,-- equality of situation -- I mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one-- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _ her _ regard , must , I think , be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune .
George Knightley	""" You speak as if you envied him . "" "" And I do envy him , Emma ."
George Knightley	"In one respect he is the object of my envy . "" Emma could say no more ."
George Knightley	"They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet , and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject , if possible . She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr. Knightley startled her , by saying , "" You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity.--You are wise -- but _ I _ can not be wise ."
George Knightley	Emma , I must tell you what you will not ask , though I may wish it unsaid the next moment .
George Knightley	""" Thank you , "" said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed ."
George Knightley	He was wishing to confide in her-- perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would , she would listen .
George Knightley	She might assist his resolution , or reconcile him to it ; she might give just praise to Harriet , or , by representing to him his own independence , relieve him from that state of indecision , which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.--They
George Knightley	had reached the house .
George Knightley	""" You are going in , I suppose ? "" said he ."
George Knightley	""" No,""--replied Emma -- quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke--""I should like to take another turn ."
George Knightley	"Mr. Perry is not gone . "" And , after proceeding a few steps , she added-- "" I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr. Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me.--I will"
George Knightley	I will tell you exactly what I think .
George Knightley	""" As a friend!""--repeated Mr. Knightley.--""Emma , that I fear is a word -- No , I have no wish -- Stay , yes , why should I hesitate?-- I have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma , I accept your offer-- Extraordinary as it may seem , I accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend.--Tell me , then , have I no chance of ever succeeding ? """
George Knightley	He stopped in his earnestness to look the question , and the expression of his eyes overpowered her .
George Knightley	""" My dearest Emma , "" said he , "" for dearest you will always be , whatever the event of this hour 's conversation , my dearest , most beloved Emma -- tell me at once ."
George Knightley	"Say ` No , ' if it is to be said . ""-- She could really say nothing.--""You are silent , "" he cried , with great animation ; "" absolutely silent !"
George Knightley	"at present I ask no more . """
George Knightley	"I can not make speeches , Emma : "" he soon resumed ; and in a tone of such sincere , decided , intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing.--""If I loved you less , I might be able to talk about it more ."
George Knightley	But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them .
George Knightley	God knows , I have been a very indifferent lover.-- But you understand me.--Yes
George Knightley	, you see , you understand my feelings-- and will return them if you can .
George Knightley	At present , I ask only to hear , once to hear your voice .
George Knightley	""" While he spoke , Emma 's mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word-- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet 's hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet 's secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not.--It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two-- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not . She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain ."
George Knightley	He _ had _ despaired at one period ; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence , as for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn , her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to , might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency ; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it , and seek no farther explanation .
George Knightley	Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material.-- Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his .
George Knightley	He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence .
George Knightley	He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it .
George Knightley	He had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill 's engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings .
George Knightley	The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill , of her having a heart completely disengaged from him , had given birth to the hope , that , in time , he might gain her affection himself;--but it had been no present hope -- he had only , in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment , aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.-- The affection , which he had been asking to be allowed to create , if he could , was already his!--Within half an hour , he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind , to something so like perfect happiness , that it could bear no other name . _
George Knightley	, there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma , and jealous of Frank Churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other .
George Knightley	It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away . He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted , encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be indifferent.-- But he had gone to a wrong place .
George Knightley	There was too much domestic happiness in his brother 's house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; Isabella was too much like Emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer.--He had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning 's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer . He had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery .
George Knightley	He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him . Frank Churchill 's character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .
George Knightley	"Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman . "" "" And who do you think came in while we were there ? "" Emma was quite at a loss . The tone implied some old acquaintance-- and how could she possibly guess ? "" Knightley ! "" continued Mrs. Elton ; "" Knightley himself!--Was not it lucky?--for , not being within when he called the other day , I had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr. E. 's , I had a great curiosity ."
George Knightley	` My friend Knightley ' had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend .
George Knightley	Knightley is quite the gentleman .
George Knightley	I like him very much .
George Knightley	Knightley!--I could not have believed it .
George Knightley	Knightley!--never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman !
George Knightley	Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman !
George Knightley	I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady .
George Knightley	This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure .
George Knightley	It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying . The impertinence of the Eltons , which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening , had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of Harriet 's infatuation.-- From Harriet 's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she had strong hopes .
George Knightley	She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational , Frank Churchill not too much in love , and Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her , how very happy a summer must be before her !
George Knightley	This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and of Harriet 's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.-- He dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself .
George Knightley	""" I do not know what your opinion may be , Mrs. Weston , "" said Mr. Knightley , "" of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith , but I think it a bad thing ."
George Knightley	"Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so ? """
George Knightley	""" I think they will neither of them do the other any good . "" """
George Knightley	You surprize me !
George Knightley	Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good . I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good !
George Knightley	This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma , Mr. Knightley .
George Knightley	""" "" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle . "" "" Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject . We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with . Mr. Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith . She is not the superior young woman which Emma 's friend ought to be . But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself ."
George Knightley	"She means it , I know . """
George Knightley	I have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule . The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now . But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma .
George Knightley	"She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding . Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate , I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not . "" """
George Knightley	"I dare say , "" replied Mrs. Weston , smiling , "" that I thought so _ then_;--but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma 's omitting to do any thing I wished ."
George Knightley	""" There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _ that_,""--said Mr. Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done ."
George Knightley	""" But I , "" he soon added , "" who have had no such charm thrown over my senses , must still see , hear , and remember ."
George Knightley	""" "" I should have been sorry , Mr. Knightley , to be dependent on _ your _ recommendation , had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse 's family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body . I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held . "" "" Yes , "" said he , smiling . "" You are better placed _ here _ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess . But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield ."
George Knightley	You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise ; but you were receiving a very good education from _ her _ , on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will , and doing as you were bid ; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife , I should certainly have named Miss Taylor .
George Knightley	""" Thank you . There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr. Weston . "" "" Why , to own the truth , I am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne ."
George Knightley	Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort , or his son may plague him .
George Knightley	""" "" I hope not _ that_.--It is not likely . No , Mr. Knightley , do not foretell vexation from that quarter . "" """
George Knightley	Not I , indeed .
George Knightley	I only name possibilities .
George Knightley	I do not pretend to Emma 's genius for foretelling and guessing .
George Knightley	I hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a Weston in merit , and a Churchill in fortune.--But Harriet Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith .
George Knightley	I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have .
George Knightley	And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _ she _ can not gain by the acquaintance .
George Knightley	I am much mistaken if Emma 's doctrines give any strength of mind , or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.--They only give a little polish .
George Knightley	""" "" I either depend more upon Emma 's good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I can not lament the acquaintance ."
George Knightley	you would rather talk of her person than her mind , would you ?
George Knightley	"Very well ; I shall not attempt to deny Emma 's being pretty . "" "" Pretty !"
George Knightley	Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether -- face and figure ?
George Knightley	"But I am a partial old friend . "" "" Such an eye!--the true hazle eye -- and so brilliant !"
George Knightley	One hears sometimes of a child being ` the picture of health ; ' now , Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown - up health .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley , is not she ?
George Knightley	""" "" I have not a fault to find with her person , "" he replied . """
George Knightley	I think her all you describe .
George Knightley	I love to look at her ; and I will add this praise , that I do not think her personally vain .
George Knightley	Mrs. Weston , I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith , or my dread of its doing them both harm .
George Knightley	""" "" And I , Mr. Knightley , am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm ."
George Knightley	"With all dear Emma 's little faults , she is an excellent creature . Where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ? No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times . "" "" Very well ; I will not plague you any more ."
George Knightley	Emma shall be an angel , and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella . John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children .
George Knightley	I am sure of having their opinions with me .
George Knightley	""" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma 's mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith 's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you ."
George Knightley	Pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it can not be expected that Emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself . It has been so many years my province to give advice , that you can not be surprized , Mr. Knightley , at this little remains of office .
George Knightley	""" "" Not at all , "" cried he ; "" I am much obliged to you for it ."
George Knightley	It is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to .
George Knightley	""" "" Be satisfied , "" said he , "" I will not raise any outcry ."
George Knightley	I will keep my ill - humour to myself . I have a very sincere interest in Emma .
George Knightley	Isabella does not seem more my sister ; has never excited a greater interest ; perhaps hardly so great .
George Knightley	"I wonder what will become of her ! "" "" So do I , "" said Mrs. Weston gently , "" very much . "" "" She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all . But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for ."
George Knightley	"I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good . But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home . "" "" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present , "" said Mrs. Weston , "" as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I can not wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse 's account ."
George Knightley	I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma , though I mean no slight to the state
George Knightley	", I assure you . "" Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr. Weston 's on the subject , as much as possible ."
George Knightley	"There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma 's destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to "" What does Weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ? "" convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield ."
George Knightley	It was an alarming change ; and Emma was thinking of it one morning , as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her , when Mr. Knightley came in , and distressing thoughts were put by .
George Knightley	"After the first chat of pleasure he was silent ; and then , in a graver tone , began with , "" I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news ."
George Knightley	""" Good or bad ? "" said she , quickly , looking up in his face ."
George Knightley	good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance .
George Knightley	""" I am afraid , "" said he , composing his features , "" I am very much afraid , my dear Emma , that you will not smile when you hear it . """
George Knightley	but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too .
George Knightley	""" There is one subject , "" he replied , "" I hope but one , on which we do not think alike . """
George Knightley	He paused a moment , again smiling , with his eyes fixed on her face .
George Knightley	cried he .
George Knightley	""" You have , I believe , and know the whole ."
George Knightley	""" You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is ."
George Knightley	""" It is so , indeed , "" continued Mr. Knightley ; "" I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left me not half an hour ago . "" She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement . "" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were the same . But in time they will . Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject ."
George Knightley	""" You mistake me , you quite mistake me , "" she replied , exerting herself ."
George Knightley	It seems an impossibility!--You can not mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin .
George Knightley	You can not mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet .
George Knightley	"You only mean , that he intends it . "" """
George Knightley	"I mean that he has done it , "" answered Mr. Knightley , with smiling but determined decision , "" and been accepted ."
George Knightley	I never was more surprized -- but it does not make me unhappy , I assure you.--How
George Knightley	They called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as I understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain.--She
George Knightley	He came down by yesterday 's coach , and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast , to report his proceedings , first on my affairs , and then on his own . This is all that I can relate of the how , where , and when .
George Knightley	""" He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply ."
George Knightley	She must wait a moment , or he would think her mad .
George Knightley	"Her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added , "" Emma , my love , you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy ; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected ."
George Knightley	His situation is an evil -- but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend ; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more .
George Knightley	His rank in society I would alter if I could , which is saying a great deal I assure you , Emma.--You laugh at me about William Larkins ; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin .
George Knightley	""" He wanted her to look up and smile ; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly -- she did -- cheerfully answering , "" You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match ."
George Knightley	""" You ought to know your friend best , "" replied Mr. Knightley ; "" but I should say she was a good - tempered , soft - hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her ."
George Knightley	"Emma could not help laughing as she answered , "" Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But , Mr. Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _ accepted _ him . I could suppose she might in time -- but can she already?-- Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him?--It was not Harriet 's hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox . "" The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was , at this moment , so strong to Emma 's feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet 's side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , "" No , I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin , "" that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature ."
George Knightley	""" Do you dare say this ? "" cried Mr. Knightley ."
George Knightley	""" Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of?-- What do you deserve ?"
George Knightley	I always deserve the best treatment , because I never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer .
George Knightley	Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are ?
George Knightley	""" I am quite sure , "" he replied , speaking very distinctly , "" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so ."
George Knightley	He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do .
George Knightley	Could I mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to Mrs. Goddard ?
George Knightley	I assured him that I could not .
George Knightley	""" "" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before . "" "" I hope so -- for at that time I was a fool . "" "" And I am changed also ; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet 's good qualities ."
George Knightley	I have taken some pains for your sake , and for Robert Martin 's sake , ( whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever , ) to get acquainted with her .
George Knightley	I have often talked to her a good deal .
George Knightley	You must have seen that I did .
George Knightley	Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin 's cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.-- Much of this , I have no doubt , she may thank you for .
George Knightley	High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would soon be over .
George Knightley	She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty .
George Knightley	""" I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning ."
George Knightley	"I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you -- and to give you joy in person . "" He thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness ."
George Knightley	""" The shame , "" he answered , "" is all mine , or ought to be . But is it possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late ."
George Knightley	"Early , I know , you had none . """
George Knightley	""" I never had the smallest , I assure you . "" "" That appears quite wonderful ."
George Knightley	""" I have some hope , "" resumed he , "" of my uncle 's being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her . When the Campbells are returned , we shall meet them in London , and continue there , I trust , till we may carry her northward.--But now , I am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard , Miss Woodhouse?-- Till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation . Do not you pity me ? """
George Knightley	"Emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried , "" Ah ! by the bye , "" then sinking his voice , and looking demure for the moment--""I hope Mr. Knightley is well ? "" He paused.--She coloured and laughed.--""I know you saw my letter , and think you may remember my wish in your favour . Let me return your congratulations.-- I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He is a man whom I can not presume to praise . """
George Knightley	"Emma was delighted , and only wanted him to go on in the same style ; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane , and his next words were , "" Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness ! such delicacy!-- and yet without being actually"
George Knightley	""" I have always admired her complexion , "" replied Emma , archly ; "" but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?-- When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten ?"
George Knightley	""" Oh ! no -- what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare-- "" But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that Emma could not help saying , "" I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time , you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.-- I am sure it was a consolation to you . "" "" Oh !"
George Knightley	no , no , no -- how can you suspect me of such a thing ?
George Knightley	I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation .
George Knightley	"I think there is a little likeness between us . "" He bowed ."
George Knightley	""" True , true , "" he answered , warmly ."
George Knightley	Observe her eyes , as she is looking up at my father.-- You will be glad to hear ( inclining his head , and whispering seriously ) that my uncle means to give her all my aunt 's jewels .
George Knightley	They are to be new set . I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head .
George Knightley	""" "" Very beautiful , indeed , "" replied Emma ; and she spoke so kindly , that he gratefully burst out , "" How delighted I am to see you again ! and to see you in such excellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world ."
George Knightley	"Do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye-- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ? """
George Knightley	"Jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice , "" How you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me!-- They _ will _ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them ! """
George Knightley	He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma 's feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley 's high superiority of character .
George Knightley	""" Is not this most vexations , Knightley ? "" she cried.--""And such weather for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious ."
George Knightley	What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done . Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston .
George Knightley	""" You had better explore to Donwell , "" replied Mr. Knightley . "" That may be done without horses ."
George Knightley	Come , and eat my strawberries .
George Knightley	"They are ripening fast . "" If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously , he was obliged to proceed so , for his proposal was caught at with delight ; and the "" Oh ! I should like it of all things , "" was not plainer in words than manner ."
George Knightley	She promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it .
George Knightley	""" You may depend upon me , "" said she ."
George Knightley	""" No,""--he calmly replied,--""there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one is-- "" "" --Mrs . Weston , I suppose , "" interrupted Mrs. Elton , rather mortified . "" No -- Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself . "" "" Ah !"
George Knightley	I know you are attached to them .
George Knightley	""" You certainly will meet them if I can prevail ; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home . """
George Knightley	""" That 's quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every day:--but as you like ."
George Knightley	It is to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley ; quite a simple thing .
George Knightley	Nothing can be more simple , you see .
George Knightley	There is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party . We are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors -- a table spread in the shade , you know .
George Knightley	"Is not that your idea ? "" "" Not quite ."
George Knightley	When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house .
George Knightley	""" Well -- as you please ; only do n't have a great set out ."
George Knightley	And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?-- Pray be sincere , Knightley .
George Knightley	"If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges , or to inspect anything-- "" "" I have not the least wish for it , I thank you ."
George Knightley	"I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;--and very long walks , you know -- in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt . """
George Knightley	Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it .
George Knightley	I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible .
George Knightley	""" "" That I am sure you would ."
George Knightley	Indeed I do you justice , my good friend .
George Knightley	Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart .
George Knightley	"As I tell Mr. E. , you are a thorough humourist.-- Yes , believe me , Knightley , I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme . You have hit upon the very thing to please me . """
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade .
George Knightley	He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse , as well as Emma , to join the party ; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill .
George Knightley	Mr. Woodhouse must not , under the specious pretence of a morning drive , and an hour or two spent at Donwell , be tempted away to his misery .
George Knightley	He was invited on good faith .
George Knightley	No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity . He did consent .
George Knightley	He had not been at Donwell for two years .
George Knightley	""" Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens ."
George Knightley	He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton , and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma 's , and Harriet 's going there some very fine morning .
George Knightley	"He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them-- very kind and sensible -- much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining out . """
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body 's most ready concurrence .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come . In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast , that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration ; and at last Donwell was settled for one day , and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing exactly right .
George Knightley	Under a bright mid - day sun , at almost Midsummer , Mr. Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage , with one window down , to partake of this al - fresco party ; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey , especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning , he was happily placed , quite at his ease , ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved , and advise every body to come and sit down , and not to heat themselves.--
George Knightley	Mrs. Weston , who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired , and sit all the time with him , remained , when all the others were invited or persuaded out , his patient listener and sympathiser .
George Knightley	"Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens-- all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent . ""--The pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear ."
George Knightley	In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete - a - tete ; but she was glad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion , and turned from her with little ceremony .
George Knightley	"He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture , etc . and Emma received a smile which seemed to say , "" These are my own concerns ."
George Knightley	. Woodhouse , who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined even by him , stirred no more ;
George Knightley	and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need . Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse 's entertainment .
George Knightley	Books of engravings , drawers of medals , cameos , corals , shells , and every other family collection within his cabinets , had been prepared for his old friend , to while away the morning ; and the kindness had perfectly answered .
George Knightley	Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused .
George Knightley	Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him , and now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child , than in a total want of taste for what he saw , for he was slow , constant , and methodical.--Before this second looking over was begun
George Knightley	, however , Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments ' free observation of the entrance and ground - plot of the house -- and was hardly there , when Jane Fairfax appeared , coming quickly in from the garden , and with a look of escape.-- Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon , there was a start at first ; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of .
George Knightley	""" Will you be so kind , "" said she , "" when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home?--I am going this moment.--My"
George Knightley	is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly.--I
George Knightley	have said
George Knightley	Till they all come in I shall not be missed ; and when they do , will you have the goodness to say that I am gone ?
George Knightley	Let my father 's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage .
George Knightley	""" Thank you , thank you -- but on no account.--I would rather walk.-- And for _ me _ to be afraid of walking alone!--I , who may so soon have to guard others ! "" She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , "" That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now ."
George Knightley	The heat was excessive ; he had never suffered any thing like it -- almost wished he had staid at home -- nothing killed him like heat -- he could bear any degree of cold , etc . , but heat was intolerable -- and he sat down , at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse 's fire , looking very deplorable .
George Knightley	I am serious , Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy -- I am sick of England-- and would leave it to - morrow , if I could .
George Knightley	You are quite mistaken .
George Knightley	"You are my best cure . "" "" We are going to Box Hill to - morrow;--you will join us ."
George Knightley	With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill ; others took it very composedly ; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax 's disappearance being explained . That it was time for every body to go , concluded the subject ; and with a short final arrangement for the next day 's scheme , they parted .
George Knightley	Isabella then went to Emma ; but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away ; and they were still discussing the point , when Mr. Knightley , who had left the room immediately after his brother 's first report of the snow ,
George Knightley	came back again , and told them that he had been out of doors to examine , and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home , whenever they liked it , either now or an hour hence .
George Knightley	"He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus-- "" Your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ? """
George Knightley	"minutes more , and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over . The carriage came : and Mr. Woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for . """
George Knightley	Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tete - a - tete drive .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her , but Emma could not quarrel with herself .
George Knightley	He was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven .
George Knightley	"It was Garrick 's , you know . "" "" Aye , very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it ."
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas -- though you know it is longer since they were with him , than with us .
George Knightley	""" "" It would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield . "" Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley 's claims on his brother , or any body 's claims on Isabella , except his own ."
George Knightley	"I think their father is too rough with them very often . "" "" He appears rough to you , "" said Emma , "" because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough . He wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father ."
George Knightley	"The children are all fond of him . "" "" And then their uncle comes in , and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way ! """
George Knightley	Mr. Frank Churchill did not come .
George Knightley	"For the present , he could not be spared , to his "" very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period . """
George Knightley	Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression .
George Knightley	For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that Frank 's coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner .
George Knightley	These feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while Mrs. Weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself .
George Knightley	Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr. Frank Churchill 's not coming , except as a disappointment at Randalls . The acquaintance at present had no charm for her .
George Knightley	She wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston 's disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship .
George Knightley	She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more , ) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away .
George Knightley	She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt , of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry ; the pleasure of looking at somebody new ; the gala - day to Highbury entire , which the sight of him would have made ; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again , found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley ; and , to her great amusement , perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion , and making use of Mrs. Weston 's arguments against herself .
George Knightley	""" The Churchills are very likely in fault , "" said Mr. Knightley , coolly ; "" but I dare say he might come if he would ."
George Knightley	""" "" I do not know why you should say so ."
George Knightley	He wishes exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him .
George Knightley	""" "" I can not believe that he has not the power of coming , if he made a point of it ."
George Knightley	"What has Mr. Frank Churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ? "" "" I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions , and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure , from living with those who have always set him the example of it . It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too ."
George Knightley	If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between September and January .
George Knightley	""" That 's easily said , and easily felt by you , who have always been your own master ."
George Knightley	You are the worst judge in the world , Mr. Knightley , of the difficulties of dependence .
George Knightley	You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage .
George Knightley	We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe , and with Mrs. Churchill 's temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do .
George Knightley	He may , at times , be able to do a great deal more than he can at others .
George Knightley	It is Frank Churchill 's duty to pay this attention to his father .
George Knightley	He knows it to be so , by his promises and messages ; but if he wished to do it , it might be done .
George Knightley	A man who felt rightly would say at once , simply and resolutely , to Mrs. Churchill-- ` Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience ; but I must go and see my father immediately .
George Knightley	I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion .
George Knightley	Such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use!--Nobody but you , Mr. Knightley , would imagine it possible .
George Knightley	But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own .
George Knightley	"Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable ? """
George Knightley	They would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims .
George Knightley	If he would act in this sort of manner , on principle , consistently , regularly , their little minds would bend to his .
George Knightley	You are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , I think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones . I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr. Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill 's situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect .
George Knightley	The Churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through .
George Knightley	To him who has , it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence , and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought . He may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it .
George Knightley	I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life .
George Knightley	He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father .
George Knightley	Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly , though in his own son ; but he is very likely to have a more yielding , complying , mild disposition than would suit your notions of man 's perfection .
George Knightley	He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father 's having any right to complain .
George Knightley	"He may be very ` aimable , ' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him . "" "" You seem determined to think ill of him ."
George Knightley	""" Me!--not at all , "" replied Mr. Knightley , rather displeased ; "" I do not want to think ill of him ."
George Knightley	I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but I hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners .
George Knightley	""" Well , if he have nothing else to recommend him , he will be a treasure at Highbury ."
George Knightley	We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain . Can not you imagine , Mr. Knightley , what a _ sensation _ his coming will produce ?
George Knightley	There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury ; but one interest-- one object of curiosity ; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill ; we shall think and speak of nobody else .
George Knightley	""" You will excuse my being so much over - powered ."
George Knightley	If I find him conversable , I shall be glad of his acquaintance ; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb , he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts .
George Knightley	""" My idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable ."
George Knightley	To you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him .
George Knightley	""" And mine , "" said Mr. Knightley warmly , "" is , that if he turn out any thing like it , he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing ! What !"
George Knightley	"My dear Emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point . "" "" I will say no more about him , "" cried Emma , "" you turn every thing to evil . We are both prejudiced ; you against , I for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here ."
George Knightley	"My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour . "" "" He is a person I never think of from one month 's end to another , "" said Mr. Knightley , with a degree of vexation , which made Emma immediately talk of something else , though she could not comprehend why he should be angry ."
George Knightley	To take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another . VOLUME II
George Knightley	Besides the Eltons , it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; so far it was all of course-- and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction , and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet 's begging to be allowed to decline it .
George Knightley	Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley , she was more conscience - stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been.--Mr
George Knightley	John Knightley came ; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day .
George Knightley	He might be able to join them in the evening , but certainly not to dinner .
George Knightley	The day came , the party were punctually assembled , and Mr. John Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable .
George Knightley	Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner
George Knightley	, he was talking to Miss Fairfax .
George Knightley	Mrs. Elton , as elegant as lace and pearls could make her , he looked at in silence-- wanting only to observe enough for Isabella 's information -- but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl , and he could talk to her . He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys , when it had been just beginning to rain .
George Knightley	"It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject , and he said , "" I hope you did not venture far , Miss Fairfax , this morning , or I am sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time ."
George Knightley	I hope you turned directly .
George Knightley	"Mr. John Knightley smiled , and replied , "" That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before ."
George Knightley	"When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for . "" There was a little blush , and then this answer , "" I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I can not expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters . "" "" Indifferent !"
George Knightley	Oh ! no -- I never conceived you could become indifferent .
George Knightley	"Letters are no matter of indifference ; they are generally a very positive curse . "" "" You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship . "" "" I have often thought them the worst of the two , "" replied he coolly ."
George Knightley	""" Business , you know , may bring money , but friendship hardly ever does ."
George Knightley	you are not serious now .
George Knightley	I know Mr. John Knightley too well-- I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body .
George Knightley	"I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation . You have every body dearest to you always at hand , I , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections , a post - office , I think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day . "" "" When I talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years , "" said John Knightley , "" I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings . I consider one as including the other ."
George Knightley	Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle -- but that is not the change I had in view for you .
George Knightley	"As an old friend , you will allow me to hope , Miss Fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have . "" It was kindly said , and very far from giving offence ."
George Knightley	I shall speak to Mr. E.
George Knightley	"If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . "" "" Excuse me , "" said Jane earnestly , "" I can not by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant ."
George Knightley	"it is a kindness to employ our men . "" Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered ; but instead of answering , she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley ."
George Knightley	So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost !
George Knightley	"If you want any farther explanation , "" continued he , smiling , "" they are paid for it ."
George Knightley	""" I have heard it asserted , "" said John Knightley , "" that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough ."
George Knightley	But for that reason , I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get . Isabella and Emma , I think , do write very much alike .
George Knightley	I have not always known their writing apart .
George Knightley	""" "" Yes , "" said his brother hesitatingly , "" there is a likeness ."
George Knightley	""" I do not admire it , "" said Mr. Knightley ."
George Knightley	They vindicated him against the base aspersion .
George Knightley	"I have a note of his.-- Do not you remember , Mrs. Weston , employing him to write for you one day ? "" "" He chose to say he was employed""-- "" Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley . """
George Knightley	"when a gallant young man , like Mr. Frank Churchill , "" said Mr. Knightley dryly , "" writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best ."
George Knightley	For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present . She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard 's , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days . While she was gone , Mr. Knightley called , and sat some time with Mr. Woodhouse and Emma , till Mr. Woodhouse , who had previously made up his mind to walk out , was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it , and was induced by the entreaties of both , though against the scruples of his own civility , to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley , who had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other .
George Knightley	""" Well , I believe , if you will excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing , I shall take Emma 's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour ."
George Knightley	As the sun is out , I believe I had better take my three turns while I can .
George Knightley	I treat you without ceremony , Mr. Knightley . We invalids think we are privileged people .
George Knightley	""" My dear sir , do not make a stranger of me . "" "" I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter ."
George Knightley	Emma will be happy to entertain you .
George Knightley	"And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk . "" "" You can not do better , sir . "" "" I would ask for the pleasure of your company , Mr. Knightley , but I am a very slow walker , and my pace would be tedious to you ; and , besides , you have another long walk before you , to Donwell Abbey . "" "" Thank you , sir , thank you ; I am going this moment myself ; and I think the sooner _ you _ go the better ."
George Knightley	"I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you . "" Mr. Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr. Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat . He began speaking of Harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before ."
George Knightley	""" I can not rate her beauty as you do , "" said he ; "" but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition . Her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman ."
George Knightley	""" "" I am glad you think so ; and the good hands , I hope , may not be wanting . "" "" Come , "" said he , "" you are anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you that you have improved her ."
George Knightley	"You have cured her of her school - girl 's giggle ; she really does you credit . "" "" Thank you ."
George Knightley	I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may .
George Knightley	_ You _ do not often overpower me with it .
George Knightley	""" You are expecting her again , you say , this morning ? "" "" Almost every moment ."
George Knightley	""" Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would . """
George Knightley	"He presently added , with a smile , "" I do not pretend to fix on times or places , but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage . "" "" Indeed !"
George Knightley	"of what sort ? "" "" A very serious sort , I assure you ; "" still smiling . "" Very serious !"
George Knightley	I can think of but one thing -- Who is in love with her ?
George Knightley	"Who makes you their confidant ? """
George Knightley	Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton 's having dropt a hint .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr. Elton looked up to him .
George Knightley	""" I have reason to think , "" he replied , "" that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert Martin is the man ."
George Knightley	He came to the Abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it .
George Knightley	He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , I believe , considers me as one of his best friends . He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether I thought her too young : in short , whether I approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _ your _ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him .
George Knightley	I was very much pleased with all that he said .
George Knightley	I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin .
George Knightley	He told me every thing ; his circumstances and plans , and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage .
George Knightley	I had no hesitation in advising him to marry . He proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , I was convinced he could not do better .
George Knightley	I praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy .
George Knightley	If he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , I dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had . This happened the night before last .
George Knightley	""" Pray , Mr. Knightley , "" said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , "" how do you know that Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday ?"
George Knightley	""" Certainly , "" replied he , surprized , "" I do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred . Was not she the whole day with you ? "" "" Come , "" said she , "" I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me . He did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused ."
George Knightley	"This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said , "" Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her . What is the foolish girl about ? """
George Knightley	"madness , if it is so ; but I hope you are mistaken . """
George Knightley	""" "" Not Harriet 's equal ! "" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , "" No , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation ."
George Knightley	She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all . My only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him . I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse . But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well .
George Knightley	The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have I now ) that there would be a general cry - out upon her extreme good luck .
George Knightley	"Even _ your _ satisfaction I made sure of . It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend 's leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well . I remember saying to myself , ` Even Emma , with all her partiality for Harriet , will think this a good match . ' "" "" I can not help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing ."
George Knightley	What ! think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more , ) a good match for my intimate friend !
George Knightley	Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own !
George Knightley	I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings .
George Knightley	I assure you mine are very different . I must think your statement by no means fair .
George Knightley	You are not just to Harriet 's claims .
George Knightley	"They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves is much above his.--It would be a degradation . "" "" A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer ! "" "" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense . She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely"
George Knightley	be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman 's daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen 's daughters , no one , I apprehend ,
George Knightley	""" "" Whoever might be her parents , "" said Mr. Knightley , "" whoever may have had the charge of her , it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society ."
George Knightley	Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it . She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer .
George Knightley	I know him well . He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion .
George Knightley	And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know .
George Knightley	You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet .
George Knightley	Harriet 's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice . Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess .
George Knightley	""" Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too ."
George Knightley	""" "" To be sure ! "" cried she playfully ."
George Knightley	""" I know _ that _ is the feeling of you all ."
George Knightley	I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment .
George Knightley	""" "" I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy , "" said Mr. Knightley presently , "" though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet ."
George Knightley	You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her .
George Knightley	Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives .
George Knightley	""" We think so very differently on this point , Mr. Knightley , that there can be no use in canvassing it ."
George Knightley	But as to my _ letting _ her marry Robert Martin , it is impossible ; she has refused him , and so decidedly , I think , as must prevent any second application .
George Knightley	She must abide by the evil of having refused him , whatever it may be ; and as to the refusal itself , I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little ; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do .
George Knightley	I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him . He was the brother of her friends , and he took pains to please her ; and altogether , having seen nobody better ( that must have been his great assistant ) she might not , while she was at Abbey - Mill , find him disagreeable .
George Knightley	Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone .
George Knightley	She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable .
George Knightley	Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence , with only one attempt on Emma 's side to talk of the weather , but he made no answer .
George Knightley	He was thinking .
George Knightley	The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words .
George Knightley	""" Robert Martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so ; and I hope it will not be long before he does ."
George Knightley	"Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain . "" Emma laughed and disclaimed ."
George Knightley	"He continued , "" Depend upon it , Elton will not do ."
George Knightley	Elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of Highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match . He knows the value of a good income as well as any body .
George Knightley	Elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally .
George Knightley	He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet 's .
George Knightley	He knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away .
George Knightley	I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with , who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece .
George Knightley	""" "" I am very much obliged to you , "" said Emma , laughing again ."
George Knightley	""" If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton 's marrying Harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself ."
George Knightley	""" Good morning to you,""--said he , rising and walking off abruptly ."
George Knightley	He was very much vexed .
George Knightley	He felt the disappointment of the young man , and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it , by the sanction he had given ; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair , was provoking him exceedingly .
George Knightley	She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary 's wrong , as Mr. Knightley .
George Knightley	He walked off in more complete self - approbation than he left for her .
George Knightley	when Harriet appeared , and in very good spirits , and without having any such reason to give for her long absence , she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind , and convinced her , that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would ,
George Knightley	He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton ; but when she considered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of Mr. Knightley 's pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about .
George Knightley	He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton .
George Knightley	Harriet 's cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of Mr. Martin , but to talk of Mr. Elton . Miss Nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight .
George Knightley	Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard 's to attend a sick child , and Miss Nash had seen him , and he had told Miss Nash , that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park , he had met Mr. Elton , and found to his great surprize , that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to London , and not meaning to return till the morrow , though it was the whist - club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ;
George Knightley	Mr. Elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _ very _ _ particular _ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious .
George Knightley	Mr. Perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must
George Knightley	he told him so ; and Mr. Elton only looked very conscious and smiling , and rode off in great spirits .
George Knightley	"Miss Nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about Mr. Elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , "" that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness . """
George Knightley	Miss Bates said a great deal ; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse 's presiding ; Mr. Knightley 's answer was the most distinct .
George Knightley	"Though , perhaps , as the _ Chaperon _ of the party-- _ I _ never was in any circle -- exploring parties -- young ladies -- married women-- "" Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband ; and he murmured , in reply , "" Very true , my love , very true ."
George Knightley	Yes , I see what she means , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) and I will try to hold my tongue .
George Knightley	"Harriet.--It did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally ; some looked very stupid about it , and Mr. Knightley gravely said , "" This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else . _ Perfection _ should not have come quite so soon ."
George Knightley	Pass Mr. E. , Knightley , Jane , and myself .
George Knightley	""" Yes , yes , pray pass _ me _ , "" added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; "" _ I _ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse , or any other young lady ."
George Knightley	Jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off .
George Knightley	"That 's one of the ladies in the Irish car party , not at all like her.-- Well , I declare-- "" They walked off , followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley ."
George Knightley	While waiting for the carriage , she found Mr. Knightley by her side .
George Knightley	"He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said , "" Emma , I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but I must still use it . I can not see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance ."
George Knightley	"How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character , age , and situation?-- Emma , I had not thought it possible . "" Emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off ."
George Knightley	""" Oh ! "" cried Emma , "" I know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her ."
George Knightley	If Emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr. Knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty . A very few days brought the party from London , and she had no
George Knightley	, than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was!-- that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley , and was now forming all her views of happiness .
George Knightley	She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!-- It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr. Elton!-- The stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed .
George Knightley	The strength , resolution , and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys , commanded his fullest dependence . While either of them protected him and his , Hartfield was safe.-- But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November .
George Knightley	The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day -- and Mr. Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce - beer , and he wanted to put it down ;
George Knightley	"But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment . "" "" I do remember it , "" cried Emma ; "" I perfectly remember it.-- Talking about spruce - beer.--Oh ! yes -- Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr. Elton 's seeming resolved to learn to like it too ."
George Knightley	I perfectly remember it.--Stop ; Mr. Knightley was standing just here , was not he ?
George Knightley	I have an idea he was standing just here .
George Knightley	III Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr. Knightley , who had been of the party , and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side
George Knightley	", he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma . He had been used to think her unjust to Jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement . "" A very pleasant evening , "" he began , as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary , told that he understood , and the papers swept away;--""particularly pleasant . You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music ."
George Knightley	I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one 's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma .
George Knightley	I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother 's , it must have been a real indulgence .
George Knightley	""" No , "" said Mr. Knightley , nearly at the same time ; "" you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension ."
George Knightley	I think you understand me , therefore .
George Knightley	""" An arch look expressed--""I understand you well enough ; "" but she said only , "" Miss Fairfax is reserved . """
George Knightley	""" I always told you she was -- a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence ."
George Knightley	""" You think her diffident . I do not see it . "" "" My dear Emma , "" said he , moving from his chair into one close by her , "" you are not going to tell me , I hope , that you had not a pleasant evening . "" "" Oh !"
George Knightley	""" "" I am disappointed , "" was his only answer ."
George Knightley	"She must have found the evening agreeable , Mr. Knightley , because she had Emma . "" "" True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax . "" Emma saw his anxiety , and wishing to appease it , at least for the present , said , and with a sincerity which no one could question-- "" She is a sort of elegant creature that one can not keep one 's eyes from . I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart . """
George Knightley	"Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , Mr. Woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the Bates 's , said-- "" It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined !"
George Knightley	"There will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like . "" "" That 's right , my dear , very right . I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way . They must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , I do not consider it unwholesome . "" "" Emma , "" said Mr. Knightley presently , "" I have a piece of news for you . You like news -- and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you . "" "" News !"
George Knightley	"What is it?--why do you smile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls ? """
George Knightley	"He had time only to say , "" No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls , "" when the door was thrown open , and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room . Full of thanks , and full of news , Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest ."
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment , and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him .
George Knightley	my dear sir , how are you this morning ?
George Knightley	My dear Miss Woodhouse-- I come quite over - powered .
George Knightley	You are too bountiful !
George Knightley	Have you heard the news ?
George Knightley	""" There is my news:--I thought it would interest you"
George Knightley	", "" said Mr. Knightley , with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them ."
George Knightley	""" But where could _ you _ hear it ? "" cried Miss Bates ."
George Knightley	""" Where could you possibly hear it , Mr. Knightley ?"
George Knightley	For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole 's note -- no , it can not be more than five-- or at least ten -- for I had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out -- I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork -- Jane was standing in the passage -- were not you , Jane?-- for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough . So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ` Shall I go down instead ?
George Knightley	But , Mr. Knightley , how could you possibly have heard it ?
George Knightley	for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me .
George Knightley	My dear sir , you really are too bountiful .
George Knightley	My mother desires her very best compliments and regards , and a thousand thanks , and says you really quite oppress her .
George Knightley	"Well , Mr. Knightley , and so you actually saw the letter ; well-- "" "" It was short -- merely to announce -- but cheerful , exulting , of course . ""-- Here was a sly glance at Emma ."
George Knightley	""" He had been so fortunate as to-- I forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them ."
George Knightley	The information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins . By his style , I should imagine it just settled .
George Knightley	""" My father would say ` yes , ' Mr. Knightley ` no ; ' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium ."
George Knightley	Good morning to you , my dear sir .
George Knightley	"It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- Mr. Frank Churchill -- must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence . Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . But "" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other . """
George Knightley	"These were charming feelings -- but not lasting . Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr. Knightley , "" She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome ! """
George Knightley	The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother 's ; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton 's activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will . Mr. Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more . He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma .
George Knightley	That Emma was his object appeared indisputable .
George Knightley	Every thing declared it ; his own attentions , his father 's hints , his mother - in - law 's guarded silence ; it was all in unison ; words , conduct , discretion , and indiscretion , told the same story .
George Knightley	But while so many were devoting him to Emma , and Emma herself making him over to Harriet , Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax .
George Knightley	He could not understand it ; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least-- symptoms of admiration on his side , which , having once observed , he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish to escape any of Emma 's errors of imagination . _ She _ was not present when the suspicion first arose .
George Knightley	He was dining with the Randalls family , and Jane , at the Eltons ' ; and he had seen a look , more than a single look , at Miss Fairfax , which , from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse , seemed somewhat out of place .
George Knightley	"When he was again in their company , he could not help remembering what he had seen ; nor could he avoid observations which , unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight , "" Myself creating what I saw , "" brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking , of private understanding even , between Frank Churchill and Jane ."
George Knightley	He had walked up one day after dinner , as he very often did , to spend his evening at Hartfield .
George Knightley	Emma and Harriet were going to walk ; he joined them ; and , on returning , they fell in with a larger party , who , like themselves , judged it wisest to take their exercise early , as the weather threatened rain ; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son , Miss Bates and her niece , who had accidentally met .
George Knightley	""" By the bye , "" said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently , "" what became of Mr. Perry 's plan of setting up his carriage ? """
George Knightley	Is Perry going to set up his carriage , Frank ?
George Knightley	"You had it from himself , had you ? """
George Knightley	""" No , sir , "" replied his son , laughing , "" I seem to have had it from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston 's having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream . I am a great dreamer ."
George Knightley	""" "" It is odd though , "" observed his father , "" that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe ."
George Knightley	Well , Frank , your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent .
George Knightley	""" Why , to own the truth , "" cried Miss Bates , who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes , "" if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days ."
George Knightley	Jane , do n't you remember grandmama 's telling us of it when we got home ? I forget where we had been walking to-- very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls .
George Knightley	Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of .
George Knightley	At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware .
George Knightley	I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not .
George Knightley	I am not like Jane ; I wish I were .
George Knightley	I will answer for it _ she _ never betrayed the least thing in the world .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley 's eyes had preceded Miss Bates 's in a glance at Jane .
George Knightley	The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass . Mr. Knightley
George Knightley	The dream must be borne with , and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield , and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use , instead of the small - sized Pembroke , on which two of his daily meals had , for forty years been crowded . Tea passed pleasantly , and nobody seemed in a hurry to move .
George Knightley	Frank was next to Emma , Jane opposite to them -- and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them all ; and it was his object to see as much as he could , with as little apparent observation .
George Knightley	She was sitting by Mr. Knightley , and turned to him for help .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream ; but how it could all be , was beyond his comprehension .
George Knightley	How the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep ! He feared there must be some decided involvement .
George Knightley	Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn . These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick .
George Knightley	With great indignation did he continue to observe him ; with great alarm and distrust , to observe also his two blinded companions .
George Knightley	He saw a short word prepared for Emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure .
George Knightley	"He saw that Emma had soon made it out , and found it highly entertaining , though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure ; for she said , "" Nonsense ! for shame ! """
George Knightley	"He heard Frank Churchill next say , with a glance towards Jane , "" I will give it to her -- shall I?""--and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth . "" No , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed . "" It was done however ."
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley 's excessive curiosity to know what this word might be , made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it , and it was not long before he saw it to be _ Dixon _ .
George Knightley	"Jane Fairfax 's perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged . She was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only , "" I did not know that proper names were allowed , "" pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered ."
George Knightley	She was immediately up , and wanting to quit the table ; but so many were also moving , that she could not get away ; and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept away by her unexamined . She was afterwards looking for her shawl -- Frank Churchill was looking also -- it was growing dusk , and the room was in confusion ; and how they parted , Mr. Knightley could not tell .
George Knightley	He remained at Hartfield after all the rest , his thoughts full of what he had seen ; so full , that when the candles came to assist his observations , he must -- yes , he certainly must , as a friend-- an anxious friend -- give Emma some hint , ask her some question .
George Knightley	He could not see her in a situation of such danger , without trying to preserve her . It was his duty .
George Knightley	""" Pray , Emma , "" said he , "" may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ?"
George Knightley	"I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other . "" Emma was extremely confused . She could not endure to give him the true explanation ; for though her suspicions were by no means removed , she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them . "" Oh !"
George Knightley	""" she cried in evident embarrassment , "" it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves . "" "" The joke , "" he replied gravely , "" seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill . "" He had hoped she would speak again , but she did not ."
George Knightley	He sat a little while in doubt .
George Knightley	A variety of evils crossed his mind .
George Knightley	Emma 's confusion , and the acknowledged intimacy , seemed to declare her affection engaged . Yet he would speak .
George Knightley	He owed it to her , to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference , rather than her welfare ; to encounter any thing , rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause .
George Knightley	""" My dear Emma , "" said he at last , with earnest kindness , "" do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ?"
George Knightley	And how could it possibly come into your head ?
George Knightley	She spoke with a confidence which staggered , with a satisfaction which silenced , Mr. Knightley .
George Knightley	She was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the where s and how s of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers .
George Knightley	He found he could not be useful , and his feelings were too much irritated for talking .
George Knightley	That he might not be irritated into an absolute fever , by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse 's tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year , he soon afterwards took a hasty leave , and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey .
George Knightley	The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from Donwell -- some of Mr. Knightley 's most liberal supply .
George Knightley	He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- I believe there is two of them .
George Knightley	But I was really quite shocked the other day-- for Mr. Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock .
George Knightley	` I am sure you must be , ' said he , ` and I will send you another supply
George Knightley	; for I have a great many more than I can ever use .
George Knightley	William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year .
George Knightley	I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing .
George Knightley	So I begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same .
George Knightley	And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me --
George Knightley	for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could .
George Knightley	I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world !
George Knightley	He would be so very . . . .
George Knightley	he have seen the heart , he would have cared very little for the lungs ; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil , without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either , he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry , and talked on with much self - contentment , totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return .
George Knightley	As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them , Emma 's fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy . Her father -- and Harriet .
George Knightley	She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father.--She even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .
George Knightley	While he lived , it must be only an engagement ; but she flattered herself , that if divested of the danger of drawing her away , it might become an increase of comfort to him.-- How to do her best by Harriet , was of more difficult decision;-- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain ; how to make her any possible atonement ; how to appear least her enemy?-- On these subjects , her perplexity and distress were very great-- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.-- She could only resolve at last , that she would still avoid a meeting with her , and communicate all that need be told by letter ; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury , and -- indulging in one scheme more-- nearly resolve , that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet ; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.-- She did not think it in Harriet 's nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety , by the streets , the shops , and the children.-- At any rate , it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself , from whom every thing was due ; a separation for the present ; an averting of the evil day , when they must all be together again .
George Knightley	She rose early , and wrote her letter to Harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that Mr. Knightley , in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before .
George Knightley	He had not left her long , by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else , when a letter was brought her from Randalls -- a very thick letter;--she guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity of reading it.-- She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill ; she wanted no explanations , she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself-- and as for understanding any thing he wrote , she was sure she was incapable of it.--It must be waded through , however .
George Knightley	Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.-- I spoke ; circumstances were in my favour ; the late event had softened away his pride , and he was , earlier than I could have anticipated , wholly reconciled and complying ; and could say at last , poor man !
George Knightley	with a deep sigh , that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake?--No ; do not pity me till I reached Highbury , and saw how ill I had made her . Do not pity me till I saw her wan , sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone.--I was not disappointed ; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey .
George Knightley	It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast . I wanted them to put off the wedding .
George Knightley	"' Tis a sad business . "" "" Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I can not possibly"
George Knightley	As soon as she came to her own name , it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself , by the natural return of her former regard for the writer , and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at
George Knightley	She never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong
George Knightley	, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever .
George Knightley	She thought so well of the letter , that when Mr. Knightley came again , she desired him to read it .
George Knightley	She was sure of Mrs. Weston 's wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr. Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct .
George Knightley	""" I shall be very glad to look it over , "" said he ; "" but it seems long ."
George Knightley	"I will take it home with me at night . "" But that would not do ."
George Knightley	Mr. Weston was to call in the evening , and she must return it by him .
George Knightley	""" I would rather be talking to you , "" he replied ; "" but as it seems a matter of justice , it shall be done . """
George Knightley	"He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , "" Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman 's letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference . "" He proceeded a little farther , reading to himself ; and then , with a smile , observed , "" Humph !"
George Knightley	"He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , "" Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman 's letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference . "" He proceeded a little farther , reading to himself ; and then , with a smile , observed , "" Humph !"
George Knightley	But it is his way .
George Knightley	"We will not be severe . "" "" It will be natural for me , "" he added shortly afterwards , "" to speak my opinion aloud as I read ."
George Knightley	By doing it , I shall feel that I am near you .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity .
George Knightley	""" He trifles here , "" said he , "" as to the temptation ."
George Knightley	""" He trifles here , "" said he , "" as to the temptation ."
George Knightley	He knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to have formed the engagement.--`His father 's disposition:'-- he is unjust , however , to his father .
George Knightley	Mr. Weston 's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions ; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.--Very true
George Knightley	"he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here . "" "" And I have not forgotten , "" said Emma , "" how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would ."
George Knightley	You pass it over very handsomely-- but you were perfectly right .
George Knightley	""" I was not quite impartial in my judgment , Emma:--but yet , I think-- had _ you _ not been in the case -- I should still have distrusted him ."
George Knightley	""" I was not quite impartial in my judgment , Emma:--but yet , I think-- had _ you _ not been in the case -- I should still have distrusted him ."
George Knightley	""" When he came to Miss Woodhouse , he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud -- all that related to her , with a smile ; a look ; a shake of the head ; a word or two of assent , or disapprobation ; or merely of love , as the subject required ; concluding , however , seriously , and , after steady reflection , thus-- "" Very bad -- though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous game ."
George Knightley	Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.-- No judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his own wishes , and regardless of little besides his own convenience.-- Fancying you to have fathomed his secret . Natural enough!-- his own mind full of intrigue , that he should suspect it in others.--Mystery ; Finesse -- how they pervert the understanding !
George Knightley	My Emma , does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other ?
George Knightley	"He did so , but very soon stopt again to say , "" the pianoforte ! Ah !"
George Knightley	After this , he made some progress without any pause .
George Knightley	Frank Churchill 's confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing .
George Knightley	""" I perfectly agree with you , sir,""--was then his remark ."
George Knightley	""" You did behave very shamefully ."
George Knightley	"You never wrote a truer line . "" And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax 's sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , "" This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could . He should have respected even unreasonable scruples , had there been such ; but hers were all reasonable . We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment . "" Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party , and grew uncomfortable ."
George Knightley	She was deeply ashamed , and a little afraid of his next look .
George Knightley	""" There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends , the Eltons , "" was his next observation.--""His feelings are natural.-- What ! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each-- she dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well , he must be a most extraordinary--"
George Knightley	""" There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends , the Eltons , "" was his next observation.--""His feelings are natural.-- What ! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each-- she dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well , he must be a most extraordinary--"
George Knightley	""" Nay , nay , read on.--You will find how very much he suffers . """
George Knightley	""" I hope he does , "" replied Mr. Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter ."
George Knightley	""" I hope he does , "" replied Mr. Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter ."
George Knightley	` Smallridge!'--What does this mean ?
George Knightley	""" She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge 's children-- a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's -- a neighbour of Maple Grove ; and , by the bye , I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment ?"
George Knightley	""" Say nothing , my dear Emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of Mrs. Elton . Only one page more ."
George Knightley	""" Say nothing , my dear Emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of Mrs. Elton . Only one page more ."
George Knightley	I shall soon have done .
George Knightley	What a letter the man writes !
George Knightley	""" "" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him . "" "" Well , there _ is _ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill.--Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her ."
George Knightley	""" "" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him . "" "" Well , there _ is _ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill.--Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her ."
George Knightley	I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker , with his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve .
George Knightley	I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker , with his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve .
George Knightley	' Come , he knows himself there .

George Knightley	That was your name for him , was it ?

George Knightley	He has had great faults , faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness ; and I am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves : but still as he is , beyond a doubt , really attached to Miss Fairfax , and will soon , it may be hoped , have the advantage of being constantly with her , I am very ready to believe his character will improve , and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants .

George Knightley	And now , let me talk to you of something else .
George Knightley	I have another person 's interest at present so much at heart , that I can not think any longer about Frank Churchill .
George Knightley	Ever since I left you this morning , Emma , my mind has been hard at work on one subject .
George Knightley	"The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father . Emma 's answer was ready at the first word . "" While her dear father lived , any change of condition must be impossible for her ."
George Knightley	The impossibility of her quitting her father , Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to .
George Knightley	He had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father 's comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded .
George Knightley	Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No , he felt that it ought not to be attempted .
George Knightley	But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as her father 's happiness in other words his life -- required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise .
George Knightley	But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as her father 's happiness in other words his life -- required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise .
George Knightley	She was sensible of all the affection it evinced . She felt that , in quitting Donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with .
George Knightley	She promised to think of it , and advised him to think of it more ; but he was fully convinced , that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject .
George Knightley	He had given it , he could assure her , very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning , to have his thoughts to himself .
George Knightley	""""
George Knightley	Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley 's marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of
George Knightley	This proposal of his , this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield-- the more she contemplated it , the more pleasing it became .
George Knightley	His evils seemed to lessen , her own advantages to increase , their mutual good to outweigh every drawback .
George Knightley	In time , of course , Mr. Knightley would be forgotten , that is , supplanted ; but this could not be expected to happen very early .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;-- not like Mr. Elton .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley , always so kind , so feeling , so truly considerate for every body , would never deserve to be less worshipped than now ; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet , that she could be in love with more than _ three _ men in one year .
George Knightley	"Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , "" Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith . ""--She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet 's imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments ."
George Knightley	"Are you speaking of -- Mr. Knightley ? "" "" To be sure I am . I never could have an idea of any body else-- and so I thought you knew . When we talked about him , it was as clear as possible ."
George Knightley	( with some elevation ) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance-- of Mr. Knightley 's coming and asking me to dance , when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me ; and when there was no other partner in the room .
George Knightley	"if I should be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to-- if Mr. Knightley should really -- if _ he _ does not mind the disparity , I hope , dear Miss Woodhouse , you will not set yourself against it , and try to put difficulties in the way . But you are too good for that , I am sure . "" Harriet was standing at one of the windows ."
George Knightley	"Emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said , "" Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley 's returning your affection ? "" "" Yes , "" replied Harriet modestly , but not fearfully--""I must say that I have . "" Emma 's eyes were instantly withdrawn ; and she sat silently meditating , in a fixed attitude , for a few minutes ."
George Knightley	Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley , than with Frank Churchill ?
George Knightley	It darted through her , with the speed of an arrow , that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself !
George Knightley	Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits-- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _ compassion _ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now , ) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet 's hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right.-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost.-- Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves . Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight.--Emma 's tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet 's , but they were not less .
George Knightley	Harriet 's detail.--Methodical , or well arranged , or very well delivered , it could not be expected to be ; but it contained , when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration , a substance to sink her spirit-- especially with the corroborating circumstances , which her own memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley 's most improved opinion of Harriet .
George Knightley	Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation . From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse 's encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it . When they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her . Emma knew it to have been very much the case .
George Knightley	She had often observed the change , to almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him-- and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet . He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings.--
George Knightley	She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet 's memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma .
George Knightley	Circumstances that might swell to half an hour 's relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush . )
George Knightley	He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged.-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming:-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _ her _ .
George Knightley	""" Might he not?--Is not it possible , that when enquiring , as you thought , into the state of your affections , he might be alluding to Mr. Martin-- he might have Mr. Martin 's interest in view ?"
George Knightley	""" Mr. Martin ! No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin ."
George Knightley	I hope I know better now , than to care for Mr. Martin , or to be suspected of it .
George Knightley	"But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . "" The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech , the many bitter feelings , made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma 's side , to enable her to say on reply , "" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . "" Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father 's footsteps . He was coming through the hall . Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him ."
George Knightley	How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her , as every feeling declared him now to be ?
George Knightley	When had his influence , such influence begun?-- When had he succeeded to that place in her affection , which Frank Churchill had once , for a short period , occupied?--She
George Knightley	; she compared the two -- compared them , as they had always stood in her estimation , from the time of the latter 's becoming known to her-- and as they must at any time have been compared by her , had it-- oh ! had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear . She saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all ! This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection .
George Knightley	to take place , on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning ; for his attachment , she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet's;--and even were this not the case , he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became commonplace , threadbare , stale in the comparison , exciting no surprize , presenting no disparity , affording nothing to be said or thought.--Mr . Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an elevation on her side !
George Knightley	It was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion , to foresee the smiles , the sneers , the merriment it would prompt at his expense ; the mortification and disdain of his brother , the thousand inconveniences to himself.--Could it be?--No
George Knightley	; it was impossible .
George Knightley	How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!-- But Harriet was less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly.-- Her inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little felt.-- She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton 's being to stoop in marrying her , than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.-- Alas !
George Knightley	By the bye , _ that _ is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece .
George Knightley	This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute . They did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield . To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her . She gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child 's pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them .
George Knightley	""" Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event ."
George Knightley	Frank Churchill came back again ; and if he kept his father 's dinner waiting , it was not known at Hartfield ; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse , to betray any imperfection which could be concealed .
George Knightley	He came back , had had his hair cut , and laughed at himself with a very good grace , but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done .
George Knightley	"He had no reason to wish his hair longer , to conceal any confusion of face ; no reason to wish the money unspent , to improve his spirits . He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever ; and , after seeing him , Emma thus moralised to herself:-- "" I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way ."
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley , he is _ not _ a trifling , silly young man .
George Knightley	If he were , he would have done this differently . He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it .
George Knightley	There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.--No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly .
George Knightley	""" With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; of judging of his general manners , and by inference , of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be , who were now seeing them together for the first time ."
George Knightley	She meant to be very happy , in spite of the scene being laid at Mr. Cole 's ; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr. Elton , even in the days of his favour , none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole .
George Knightley	She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole 's door ; and was pleased to see that it was Mr. Knightley 's ; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses , having little spare money and a great deal of health , activity , and independence , was too apt , in Emma 's opinion , to get about as he could , and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey . She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart , for he stopped to hand her out .
George Knightley	""" This is coming as you should do , "" said she ; "" like a gentleman.-- I am quite glad to see you . "" He thanked her , observing , "" How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment !"
George Knightley	"if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.-- You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner . """
George Knightley	""" "" Nonsensical girl ! "" was his reply , but not at all in anger ."
George Knightley	Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr. Knightley .
George Knightley	When the Westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , the strongest of admiration were for her , from both husband and wife ; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and , as she firmly believed , not without some dexterity on his side . The party was rather large , as it included one other family , a proper unobjectionable country family , whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part of Mr. Cox 's family , the lawyer of Highbury .
George Knightley	Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting . She listened , and found it well worth listening to .
George Knightley	That very dear part of Emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply .
George Knightley	Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates , and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte -- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand , but a large - sized square pianoforte ; and the substance of the story , the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations on her side , and explanations on Miss Bates 's , was , that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood 's the day before , to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at first , by Miss Bates 's account , Jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it-- but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell .
George Knightley	""" One can suppose nothing else , "" added Mrs. Cole , "" and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt ."
George Knightley	She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present .
George Knightley	Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her ; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell , and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made ; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way , and still listen to Mrs. Cole .
George Knightley	""" I declare , I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!--It"
George Knightley	always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument .
George Knightley	and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with.--I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought-- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We
George Knightley	""" Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence ; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole 's , turned to Frank Churchill ."
George Knightley	""" Why do you smile ? "" said she ."
George Knightley	""" What do you say to Mrs. Dixon ? "" "" Mrs. Dixon ! very true indeed ."
George Knightley	"We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance . "" "" Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I can not help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend ,"
George Knightley	One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland .
George Knightley	As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body 's native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ?
George Knightley	Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and I dare say in her 's .
George Knightley	I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are .
George Knightley	Did you ever hear of that?-- A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard .
George Knightley	"I do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries . "" The conversation was here interrupted . They were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses , and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others ; but when the table was again safely covered , when every corner dish was placed exactly right , and occupation and ease were generally restored , Emma said , "" The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me ."
George Knightley	I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business .
George Knightley	""" Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced ."
George Knightley	Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely .
George Knightley	"But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . "" There was no occasion to press the matter farther . The conviction seemed real ; he looked as if he felt it . She said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes . The ladies had not been long in the drawing - room , before the other ladies , in their different divisions , arrived ."
George Knightley	She was his object , and every body must perceive it .
George Knightley	"She introduced him to her friend , Miss Smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other . "" He had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naivete ."
George Knightley	""" And she , "" Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton . "" Emma restrained her indignation , and only turned from her in silence ."
George Knightley	Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax ; but it was most prudent to avoid speech .
George Knightley	He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining - room-- hated sitting long -- was always the first to move when he could-- that his father , Mr. Knightley , Mr. Cox , and Mr. Cole , were left very busy over parish business -- that as long as he had staid , however , it had been pleasant enough , as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike , sensible men ; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether -- thought it so abundant in agreeable families-- that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much . She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire-- the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as Enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and
George Knightley	that even when days were fixed , and invitations accepted , it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going ; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person ; and that , though he had his separate engagements , it was not without difficulty , without considerable address _ at _ _ times _ , that he could get away , or introduce an acquaintance for a night .
George Knightley	His importance at Enscombe was very evident .
George Knightley	He did not boast , but it naturally betrayed itself , that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing , and on her laughing and noticing it , he owned that he believed ( excepting one or two points ) he could _ with _ _ time _ persuade her to any thing .
George Knightley	One of those points on which his influence failed , he then mentioned .
George Knightley	He had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it .
George Knightley	_ Now _ , he said , he was beginning to have no longer the same wish .
George Knightley	The unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father .
George Knightley	""" I have made a most wretched discovery , "" said he , after a short pause.-- "" I have been here a week to - morrow -- half my time ."
George Knightley	I never knew days fly so fast .
George Knightley	A week to - morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself . But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston , and others!-- I hate the recollection .
George Knightley	""" Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut ."
George Knightley	""" No , "" said he , smiling , "" that is no subject of regret at all ."
George Knightley	"I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen . "" The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to Mr. Cole . When Mr. Cole had moved away , and her attention could be restored as before , she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax , who was sitting exactly opposite ."
George Knightley	My dear Emma , I am longing to talk to you .
George Knightley	I have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and I must tell them while the idea is fresh .
George Knightley	"How else could they come ? "" "" Very true.--Well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now . And as I looked at her , though I never saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold ."
George Knightley	I could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room , and I could get at him , I spoke to him about the carriage .
George Knightley	You may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , I made my way directly to Miss Bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once .
George Knightley	And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all .
George Knightley	I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them .
George Knightley	I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent .
George Knightley	He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax 's ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley .
George Knightley	I know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray .
George Knightley	""" Well , "" said Mrs. Weston , smiling , "" you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again . The more I think of it , the more probable it appears ."
George Knightley	In short , I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax .
George Knightley	"See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to it ? "" "" Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax ! "" exclaimed Emma ."
George Knightley	""" Dear Mrs. Weston , how could you think of such a thing?--Mr . Knightley!--Mr . Knightley must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--"
George Knightley	no , no , Henry must have Donwell .
George Knightley	I can not at all consent to Mr. Knightley 's marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely .
George Knightley	"I am amazed that you should think of such a thing . "" "" My dear Emma , I have told you what led me to think of it ."
George Knightley	"I do not want the match -- I do not want to injure dear little Henry-- but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry 's account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ? "" "" Yes , I would ."
George Knightley	I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.-- Mr. Knightley marry!--No , I have never had such an idea , and I can not adopt it now .
George Knightley	""" Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know . "" "" But the imprudence of such a match ! "" "" I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability ."
George Knightley	His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses .
George Knightley	He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax-- and is always glad to shew them attention .
George Knightley	My dear Mrs. Weston , do not take to match - making .
George Knightley	For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing .
George Knightley	""" "" Imprudent , if you please -- but not mad . Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable . "" "" But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry ."
George Knightley	I am sure he has not the least idea of it .
George Knightley	Do not put it into his head .
George Knightley	Why should he marry?-- He is as happy as possible by himself ; with his farm , and his sheep , and his library , and all the parish to manage ; and he is extremely fond of his brother 's children .
George Knightley	He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart .
George Knightley	""" "" My dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax-- "" "" Nonsense !"
George Knightley	He does not care about Jane Fairfax .
George Knightley	In the way of love , I am sure he does not .
George Knightley	"He would do any good to her , or her family ; but-- "" "" Well , "" said Mrs. Weston , laughing , "" perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give Jane such a respectable home ."
George Knightley	""" If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion ."
George Knightley	How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey , and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?-- ` So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour ! '
George Knightley	"` Not that it was such a very old petticoat either -- for still it would last a great while -- and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong . ' "" "" For shame , Emma ! Do not mimic her . You divert me against my conscience . And , upon my word , I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates ."
George Knightley	Little things do not irritate him .
George Knightley	She might talk on ; and if he wanted to say any thing himself , he would only talk louder , and drown her voice .
George Knightley	But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does .
George Knightley	I have heard him speak , and so must you , so very highly of Jane Fairfax !
George Knightley	The interest he takes in her-- his anxiety about her health -- his concern that she should have no happier prospect !
George Knightley	I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice !
George Knightley	I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever . Oh !
George Knightley	and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody-- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr. Knightley ?
George Knightley	I can not help suspecting him .
George Knightley	"I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love . "" "" Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love ."
George Knightley	But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do .
George Knightley	Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously .
George Knightley	""" "" I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him . """
George Knightley	""" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so . "" "" There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma . I have a very strong notion that it comes from him ."
George Knightley	I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner .
George Knightley	""" "" You take up an idea , Mrs. Weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . I see no sign of attachment-- I believe nothing of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax . """
George Knightley	They combated the point some time longer in the same way ; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend ; for Mrs. Weston was the most used of the two to yield ; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over , and the instrument in preparation;-- and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it .
George Knightley	Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr. Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .
George Knightley	But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half Emma 's mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs. Weston 's suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions .
George Knightley	Her objections to Mr. Knightley 's marrying did not in the least subside .
George Knightley	A real injury to the children -- a most mortifying change , and material loss to them all;--a very great deduction from her father 's daily comfort -- and , as to herself , she could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey . A Mrs. Knightley for them all to give way to!--No -- Mr. Knightley must never marry .
George Knightley	Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell .
George Knightley	Presently Mr. Knightley looked back , and came and sat down by her .
George Knightley	They talked at first only of the performance . His admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for Mrs. Weston , it would not have struck her .
George Knightley	As a sort of touchstone , however , she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece ; and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short , she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own .
George Knightley	""" I often feel concern , "" said she , "" that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions . It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose ."
George Knightley	""" Quite out of the question , quite out of the question , "" he replied;-- "" but you must often wish it , I am sure . """
George Knightley	And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step .
George Knightley	""" "" Yes , "" he replied , and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.-- "" But they would have done better had they given her notice of it ."
George Knightley	I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell .
George Knightley	""" From that moment , Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument . But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a little longer doubtful ."
George Knightley	"The strength of the song falls on the second . "" Mr. Knightley grew angry ."
George Knightley	""" That fellow , "" said he , indignantly , "" thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice ."
George Knightley	While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off , Emma found time , in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste , to look about , and see what became of Mr. Knightley .
George Knightley	This would be a trial . He was no dancer in general .
George Knightley	If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now , it might augur something .
George Knightley	No ; he was talking to Mrs. Cole-- he was looking on unconcerned ; Jane was asked by somebody else , and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole . Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry ; his interest was yet safe ; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment .
Mr. Woodhouse	It did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday . Vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges .
Mr. Woodhouse	"His father only called him a coxcomb , and thought it a very good story ; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it , was clear enough , by her passing it over as quickly as possible , and making no other comment than that "" all young people would have their little whims . """
Mr. Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether . He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect .
Mr. Woodhouse	Nothing should tempt _ her _ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father 's known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish .
Mr. Woodhouse	"Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and Mrs. Weston 's accounting for it with "" I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out , "" was not quite sufficient ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that "" of course it must be declined , "" she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful . She owned that , considering every thing , she was not absolutely without inclination for the party . The Coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it-- so much consideration for her father . "" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company . """
Mr. Woodhouse	Upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly Mrs. Goddard , if not Mrs. Bates , might be depended on for bearing him company-- Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter 's going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him .
Mr. Woodhouse	As for _ his _ going , Emma did not wish him to think it possible , the hours would be too late , and the party too numerous .
Mr. Woodhouse	He was soon pretty well resigned .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I am not fond of dinner - visiting , "" said he--""I never was ."
Mr. Woodhouse	I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it . I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to .
Mr. Woodhouse	"However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr. Knightley too , to take care of her , I can not wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy . """
Mr. Woodhouse	But the idea of any thing to be done in a _ moment _ , was increasing , not lessening , Mr. Woodhouse 's agitation .
Mr. Woodhouse	"With this treatment , Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual . "" He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard ."
Mr. Woodhouse	""" You will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible ."
Mr. Woodhouse	You will say that I am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _ compliments _ , of course .
Mr. Woodhouse	But you will do every thing right . I need not tell you what is to be done .
Mr. Woodhouse	We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday . I shall have no fears for you with him .
Mr. Woodhouse	We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely .
Mr. Woodhouse	"You will not like staying late . You will get very tired when tea is over . "" "" But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ? """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Oh ! no , my love ; but you will soon be tired ."
Mr. Woodhouse	", "" said Mr. Woodhouse ."
Mr. Woodhouse	My dear Emma , we must consider this .
Mr. Woodhouse	I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish .
Mr. Woodhouse	"You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends . "" "" Oh yes , papa ."
Mr. Woodhouse	I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston , but on your account .
Mr. Woodhouse	I am only afraid of your sitting up for me .
Mr. Woodhouse	I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard .
Mr. Woodhouse	She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort .
Mr. Woodhouse	The weather added what it could of gloom . A cold stormy rain set in , and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs , which the wind was despoiling , and the length of the day , which only made such cruel sights the longer visible . The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse , and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter 's side , and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before .
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way .
Mr. Woodhouse	He liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at Hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked .
Mr. Woodhouse	He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms .
Mr. Woodhouse	Fortunately for him , Highbury , including Randalls in the same parish , and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of Mr. Knightley , comprehended many such .
Mr. Woodhouse	Not unfrequently , through Emma 's persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card - table for him . Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; and by Mr. Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse 's drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away .
Mr. Woodhouse	After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates , and Mrs. Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .
Mr. Woodhouse	She was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip .
Mr. Woodhouse	She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse 's kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside . These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father 's sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston .
Mr. Woodhouse	Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare . He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat .
Mr. Woodhouse	"Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say : "" Mrs. Bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs ."
Mr. Woodhouse	I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you .
Mr. Woodhouse	I do not advise the custard .
Mr. Woodhouse	"I do not think it could disagree with you . "" Emma allowed her father to talk -- but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy ."
Mr. Woodhouse	Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury , and longed to dance again ; and the last half - hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls , was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject .
Mr. Woodhouse	Emma said it would be awkward ; Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper ; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health
Mr. Woodhouse	It made him so very unhappy , indeed , that it could not be persevered in .
Mr. Woodhouse	"no , "" said he ; "" it would be the extreme of imprudence ."
Mr. Woodhouse	I could not bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong .
Mr. Woodhouse	"I do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing ! """
Mr. Woodhouse	Yes ; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Sir , "" said Mr. Woodhouse , rather warmly , "" you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill . But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father 's house . "" "" From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"Dancing with open windows!--I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs. Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it . "" """
Mr. Woodhouse	Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister 's side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable.-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse 's carriage.--It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square .
Mr. Woodhouse	"They seem not able to do any thing without him.--`Upon my word , Mr. E. , ' I often say , ` rather you than I.-- I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if I had half so many applicants . '--Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.--However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all . "" And putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma--""A congratulatory visit , you know.--Oh ! yes , quite indispensable . "" Miss Bates looked about her , so happily!-- "" He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley ; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.--Mr"
Mr. Woodhouse	In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings ; but one complete dinner engagement , and out of the house too , there was no avoiding , though at Christmas . Mr. Weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party .
Mr. Woodhouse	How they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter 's carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also .
Mr. Woodhouse	Harriet , Mr. Elton , and Mr. Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr. Woodhouse 's habits and inclination being consulted in every thing .
Mr. Woodhouse	The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house .
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it .
Mr. Woodhouse	Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour .
Mr. Woodhouse	The preparing and the going abroad in such weather , with the sacrifice of his children after dinner , were evils , were disagreeables at least , which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like ; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase ; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day 's party , which it might very possibly have done , for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence ."
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women , and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them , as you are where these children are concerned , we might always think alike . """
Mr. Woodhouse	I was sixteen years old when you were born .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" A material difference then , "" she replied--""and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one - and - twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ?"
Mr. Woodhouse	Come , my dear Emma , let us be friends , and say no more about it . Tell your aunt , little Emma , that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances , and that if she were not wrong before , she is now .
Mr. Woodhouse	The plan of a drain , the change of a fence , the felling of a tree , and the destination of every acre for wheat , turnips , or spring corn , was entered into with as much equality of interest by John , as his cooler manners rendered possible ; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about , his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness .
Mr. Woodhouse	"My dear Emma , suppose we all have a little gruel . "" Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;--and two basins only were ordered ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"After a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection , "" It was an awkward business , my dear , your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"He will be so pleased to see my little ones . "" "" I hope he will be here to - morrow , for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"I should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path . . . . The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps . I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion . "" Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;-- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen . "" "" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks--`Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor 's leave'--something which , you knew , I did not approve ."
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Emma , my dear Emma-- "" "" Oh ! "" she cried with more thorough gaiety , "" if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion ."
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" Ah ! "" he cried , "" I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together ."
Mr. Woodhouse	As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse 's visits , Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause , resolved first to announce it at home , and then at Randalls.-- But how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself to do it , in such an hour of Mr. Knightley 's absence , or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her , and she must have put it off ; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time , and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced to speak , and to speak cheerfully too . She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself .
Mr. Woodhouse	well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse 's mind.--It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other-- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place . Mrs. Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield ! And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable!-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband 's plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma .
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse told me of it .
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life .
Mr. Woodhouse	"But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse 's giving a gentle sigh , and saying , "" Ah , poor Miss Taylor !"
Mr. Woodhouse	There was no recovering Miss Taylor -- nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse .
Mr. Woodhouse	The compliments of his neighbours were over ; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event ; and the wedding - cake , which had been a great distress to him , was all eat up .
Mr. Woodhouse	His own stomach could bear nothing rich , and he could never believe other people to be different from himself .
Mr. Woodhouse	What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding - cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body 's eating it .
Mr. Woodhouse	He had been at the pains of consulting Mr. Perry , the apothecary , on the subject
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse 's life ; and upon being applied to , he could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination ) that wedding - cake might certainly disagree with many -- perhaps with most people , unless taken moderately .
Mr. Woodhouse	With such an opinion , in confirmation of his own , Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair ; but still the cake was eaten ; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone .
Mr. Woodhouse	There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston 's wedding - cake in their hands : but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it .
Mr. Woodhouse	And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning . They were all three walking about together for an hour or two-- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield , and afterwards in Highbury . He was delighted with every thing ; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse 's ear ; and when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village , and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed .
Mr. Woodhouse	Emma watched and decided , that with such feelings as were now shewn , it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been acting a part , or making a parade of insincere professions ; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him justice .
Mr. Woodhouse	Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again . It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ) , as well as Miss Smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent-- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and Harriet not much otherwise , Emma would not interfere with .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" I should have been sorry , Mr. Knightley , to be dependent on _ your _ recommendation , had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse 's family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body . I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held . "" "" Yes , "" said he , smiling . "" You are better placed _ here _ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess . But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good . But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home . "" "" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present , "" said Mrs. Weston , "" as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I can not wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse 's account ."
Mr. Woodhouse	. Weston was alone in the drawing - room:-- but hardly had they been told of the baby , and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for coming , which he asked for , when a glimpse was caught through the blind , of two figures passing near the window .
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared . Mr. Weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation .
Mr. Woodhouse	"She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention . She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse : "" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow . "" Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer ."
Mr. Woodhouse	Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son - in - law , who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I admired your resolution very much , sir , "" said he , "" in venturing out in such weather , for of course you saw there would be snow very soon ."
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Mr. Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house . "" What is to be done , my dear Emma?--what is to be done ? "" was Mr. Woodhouse 's first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time ."
Mr. Woodhouse	To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little .
Mr. Woodhouse	His eldest daughter 's alarm was equal to his own .
Mr. Woodhouse	The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Indeed ! "" replied he ."
Mr. Woodhouse	To Isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father 's account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls .
Mr. Woodhouse	"He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus-- "" Your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ? """
Mr. Woodhouse	"minutes more , and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over . The carriage came : and Mr. Woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for . """
Mr. Woodhouse	He was afraid they should have a very bad drive .
Mr. Woodhouse	He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it .
Mr. Woodhouse	And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind . He did not know what they had best do .
Mr. Woodhouse	Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tete - a - tete drive .
Mr. Woodhouse	If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed!--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse ! who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near !
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Never , madam , "" cried he , affronted in his turn : "" never , I assure you . _"
Mr. Woodhouse	I _ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl ; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled .
Mr. Woodhouse	I wish her extremely well : and , no doubt , there are men who might not object to --
Mr. Woodhouse	Every body has their level : but as for myself , I am not , I think , quite so much at a loss .
Mr. Woodhouse	"I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!-- No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received-- "" "" Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it . I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend ."
Mr. Woodhouse	In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance .
Mr. Woodhouse	"But , as it is , the disappointment is single , and , I trust , will not be lasting . I have no thoughts of matrimony at present . "" He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace . If there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment . Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma"
Mr. Woodhouse	then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night .
Mr. Woodhouse	There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of-- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr. John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .
Mr. Woodhouse	Miss Nash , head - teacher at Mrs. Goddard 's , had written out at least three hundred ; and Harriet , who had taken the first hint of it from her , hoped , with Miss Woodhouse 's help , to get a great many more .
Mr. Woodhouse	"Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls , and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in . "" So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them !"
Mr. Woodhouse	"but he hoped he should in time . "" And it always ended in "" Kitty , a fair but frozen maid . """
Mr. Woodhouse	His good friend Perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter .
Mr. Woodhouse	It was by no means his daughter 's wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition .
Mr. Woodhouse	"He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse""--he stopt a moment--""or Miss Smith could inspire him . """
Mr. Woodhouse	My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth !
Mr. Woodhouse	Another view of man , my second brings , Behold him there , the monarch of the seas !
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Knightley , I wish you had the benefit of this ; I think this would convince you .
Mr. Woodhouse	For once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" What can it be , Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be ?"
Mr. Woodhouse	Do try to find it out , Miss Woodhouse .
Mr. Woodhouse	Do you think it is a good one ?
Mr. Woodhouse	"Miss Woodhouse , do you think we shall ever find it out ? "" "" Mermaids and sharks !"
Mr. Woodhouse	My dear Harriet , what are you thinking of ?
Mr. Woodhouse	My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth !
Mr. Woodhouse	Another view of man , my second brings ;
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" Dear Miss Woodhouse!""--and "" Dear Miss Woodhouse , "" was all that Harriet , with many tender embraces could articulate at first ; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation , it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw , felt , anticipated , and remembered just as she ought ."
Mr. Woodhouse	Miss Woodhouse , what a pity that I must not write this beautiful
Mr. Woodhouse	"Do as you please . "" Mr. Woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of "" Well , my dears , how does your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh ? "" "" Yes , papa ; we have something to read you , something quite fresh ."
Mr. Woodhouse	She read it to him , just as he liked to have any thing read , slowly and distinctly , and two or three times over , with explanations of every part as she proceeded -- and he was very much pleased , and , as she had foreseen , especially struck with the complimentary conclusion .
Mr. Woodhouse	It is such a pretty charade , my dear , that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written
Mr. Woodhouse	"Emma only nodded , and smiled.--After a little thinking , and a very tender sigh , he added , "" Ah !"
Mr. Woodhouse	If I had but her memory !
Mr. Woodhouse	But I can remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention ; I can only recollect the first stanza ; and there are several .
Mr. Woodhouse	Kitty , a fair but frozen maid , Kindled a flame I yet deplore , The hood - wink'd boy I called to aid , Though of his near approach afraid , So fatal to my suit before . And that is all that I can recollect of it -- but it is very clever all the way through . But I think , my dear , you said you had got it .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Yes , papa , it is written out in our second page ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"It was Garrick 's , you know . "" "" Aye , very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it ."
Mr. Woodhouse	The name makes me think of poor Isabella ; for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama .
Mr. Woodhouse	I hope we shall have her here next week .
Mr. Woodhouse	Have you thought , my dear , where you shall put her -- and what room there will be for the children ?
Mr. Woodhouse	yes -- she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual , you know .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" I do not know , my dear -- but it is so long since she was here!--not since last Easter , and then only for a few days.--Mr . John Knightley 's being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly taken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here ! """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" She will not be surprized , papa , at least ."
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Yes , my dear , if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she is coming for only one week ."
Mr. Woodhouse	and we ought to be thankful , papa , that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country , that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" It would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield . "" Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley 's claims on his brother , or any body 's claims on Isabella , except his own ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"He sat musing a little while , and then said , "" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does . I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . She and the children might stay very well ."
Mr. Woodhouse	papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish , and I do not think you ever will .
Mr. Woodhouse	Isabella can not bear to stay behind her husband .
Mr. Woodhouse	Unwelcome as it was , Mr. Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter 's attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them .
Mr. Woodhouse	I am sure she will be pleased with the children . We are very proud of the children , are not we , papa ?
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" Aye , I wonder which she will ."
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" I dare say they are , sir ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"I think their father is too rough with them very often . "" "" He appears rough to you , "" said Emma , "" because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough . He wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father ."
Mr. Woodhouse	""" But they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"It is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other . "" "" Well , I can not understand it . "" "" That is the case with us all , papa ."
Mr. Woodhouse	His ostensible reason , however , was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse 's party could be made up in the evening without him , or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield .
Mr. Woodhouse	They will come and stand by my chair , and say , ` Grandpapa , can you give me a bit of string ? ' and once Henry asked me for a knife , but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" In this style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room ; her vanity had then a change of object , and Emma heard her saying in the same half - whisper to Jane , "" Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest!--Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature he is;--I assure you I like him excessively . I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me ."
Mr. Woodhouse	But this good old Mr. Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner .
Mr. Woodhouse	I fancy I am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown .
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , as he would have been sorry to see him before .
Mr. Woodhouse	It was well that he took every body 's joy for granted , or he might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly delighted .
Mr. Woodhouse	After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes , Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness , and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself , with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him . The persons to be invited , required little thought .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" She would rather not be in his company more than she could help ."
Mr. Woodhouse	She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable .
Mr. Woodhouse	"He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her . "" This is very true , "" said she , "" at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--"
Mr. Woodhouse	The two eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring , and their papa now proposed bringing them , and staying one whole day at Hartfield -- which one day would be the very day of this party.--His professional engagements did not allow of his being put off , but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so .
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear-- and here would be a ninth -- and Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty - eight hours without falling in with a dinner - party .
Mr. Woodhouse	She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself , by representing that though he certainly would make them nine , yet he always said so little , that the increase of noise would be very immaterial . She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself , to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother .
Mr. Woodhouse	The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma .
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease ; and the seeing him so , with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate , removed the chief of even Emma 's vexation .
Mr. Woodhouse	"A pleasant "" thank you "" seemed meant to laugh it off , but a blush , a quivering lip , a tear in the eye , shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh . Her attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse , who being , according to his custom on such occasions , making the circle of his guests , and paying his particular compliments to the ladies , was ending with her -- and with all his mildest urbanity , said , "" I am very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain . Young ladies should take care of themselves.--"
Mr. Woodhouse	My dear , did you change your stockings ?
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" Yes , sir , I did indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" My dear Miss Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for.-- I hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well ."
Mr. Woodhouse	They are some of my very old friends .
Mr. Woodhouse	I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour .
Mr. Woodhouse	You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure .
Mr. Woodhouse	"My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield . "" The kind - hearted , polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty , and made every fair lady welcome and easy ."
Mr. Woodhouse	By this time , the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton , and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" My dear Jane , what is this I hear?--Going to the post - office in the rain!--This must not be , I assure you.--You sad girl , how could you do such a thing?--It"
Mr. Woodhouse	is a sign I was not there to take care of you .
Mr. Woodhouse	"Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold . """
Mr. Woodhouse	do not tell _ me _ .
Mr. Woodhouse	"You and I must positively exert our authority . "" "" My advice , "" said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively , "" I certainly do feel tempted to give ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"she _ shall _ _ not _ do such a thing again , "" eagerly rejoined Mrs. Elton ."
Mr. Woodhouse	I shall speak to Mr. E.
Mr. Woodhouse	The man who fetches our letters every morning ( one of our men , I forget his name ) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you . That will obviate all difficulties you know ; and from _ us _ I really think , my dear Jane , you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" My dear Jane , say no more about it . The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master . You know , Mrs. Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves ."
Mr. Woodhouse	But I do flatter myself , my dear Jane , that my influence is not entirely worn out .
Mr. Woodhouse	"If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . "" "" Excuse me , "" said Jane earnestly , "" I can not by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant ."
Mr. Woodhouse	my dear ; but so much as Patty has
Mr. Woodhouse	I know what you mean -- but Emma 's hand is the strongest .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Isabella and Emma both write beautifully , "" said Mr. Woodhouse ; "" and always did ."
Mr. Woodhouse	". Elton , before she could be spoken to , was ready ; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining - parlour , was saying-- "" Must I go first ?"
Mr. Woodhouse	"I really am ashamed of always leading the way . """
Mr. Woodhouse	For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present . She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard 's , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days . While she was gone , Mr. Knightley called , and sat some time with Mr. Woodhouse and Emma , till Mr. Woodhouse , who had previously made up his mind to walk out , was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it , and was induced by the entreaties of both , though against the scruples of his own civility , to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose .
Mr. Woodhouse	"And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk . "" "" You can not do better , sir . "" "" I would ask for the pleasure of your company , Mr. Knightley , but I am a very slow walker , and my pace would be tedious to you ; and , besides , you have another long walk before you , to Donwell Abbey . "" "" Thank you , sir , thank you ; I am going this moment myself ; and I think the sooner _ you _ go the better ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you . "" Mr. Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr. Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat . He began speaking of Harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"You have cured her of her school - girl 's giggle ; she really does you credit . "" "" Thank you ."
Mr. Woodhouse	_ You _ do not often overpower me with it .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" You are expecting her again , you say , this morning ? "" "" Almost every moment ."
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man , but I can not admit him to be Harriet 's equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her . By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples .
Mr. Woodhouse	"Even _ your _ satisfaction I made sure of . It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend 's leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well . I remember saying to myself , ` Even Emma , with all her partiality for Harriet , will think this a good match . ' "" "" I can not help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing ."
Mr. Woodhouse	Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed . Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour - boarder at Mrs. Goddard 's all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other , ) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master 's son .
Mr. Woodhouse	The misfortune of Harriet 's cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella 's coming , and of Emma 's being to follow ,
Mr. Woodhouse	had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs. Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma .
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing - room .
Mr. Woodhouse	To be sitting long after dinner , was a confinement that he could not endure .
Mr. Woodhouse	Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him ; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable .
Mr. Woodhouse	"While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying , "" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"The introduction must be unpleasant , whenever it takes place ; and the sooner it could be over , the better . "" "" Yes ; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays . Even if this family , the Braithwaites , are put off , I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us ."
Mr. Woodhouse	I can not bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves .
Mr. Woodhouse	In short , I can feel no dependence on his coming , and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine .
Mr. Woodhouse	But Mr. Woodhouse -- how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to consent?--he , who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event . When first sounded on the subject , he was so miserable , that they were almost hopeless.--A second allusion , indeed , gave less pain.-- He began to think it was to be , and that he could not prevent it-- a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation .
Mr. Woodhouse	Still , however , he was not happy .
Mr. Woodhouse	Nay , he appeared so much otherwise , that his daughter 's courage failed . She could not bear to see him suffering , to know him fancying himself neglected ; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys , that when once the event were over , his distress would be soon over too , she hesitated -- she could not proceed .
Mr. Woodhouse	In this state of suspense they were befriended , not by any sudden illumination of Mr. Woodhouse 's mind , or any wonderful change of his nervous system , but by the operation of the same system in another way.-- Mrs. Weston 's poultry - house was robbed one night of all her turkeys-- evidently by the ingenuity of man . Other poultry - yards in the neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _ housebreaking _ to Mr. Woodhouse 's fears.--He was very uneasy ; and but for the sense of his son - in - law 's protection , would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life .
Mr. Woodhouse	The strength , resolution , and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys , commanded his fullest dependence . While either of them protected him and his , Hartfield was safe.-- But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November .
Mr. Woodhouse	XVII Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield . The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and Mr. Woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella;--which poor Isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness .
Mr. Woodhouse	"The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with Mr. Elton 's best compliments , "" that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense-- and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them . "" Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr . Elton 's absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired ."
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms , and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude .
Mr. Woodhouse	", he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma . He had been used to think her unjust to Jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement . "" A very pleasant evening , "" he began , as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary , told that he understood , and the papers swept away;--""particularly pleasant . You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , Mr. Woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the Bates 's , said-- "" It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined !"
Mr. Woodhouse	and I have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon-- Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate -- Hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork -- I think we had better send the leg-- do not you think so , my dear ?
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" My dear papa , I sent the whole hind - quarter ."
Mr. Woodhouse	I knew you would wish it .
Mr. Woodhouse	"There will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like . "" "" That 's right , my dear , very right . I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way . They must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , I do not consider it unwholesome . "" "" Emma , "" said Mr. Knightley presently , "" I have a piece of news for you . You like news -- and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you . "" "" News !"
Mr. Woodhouse	My dear Miss Woodhouse-- I come quite over - powered .
Mr. Woodhouse	"When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind . "" "" Very true , Miss Woodhouse , so she will . He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry ."
Mr. Woodhouse	Miss Hawkins,--I dare say , an excellent young woman .
Mr. Woodhouse	His extreme attention to my mother-- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know -- it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick .
Mr. Woodhouse	Colonel Campbell , you know , is quite our angel .
Mr. Woodhouse	-- I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry .
Mr. Woodhouse	"I say , sir , "" turning to Mr. Woodhouse , "" I think there are few places with such society as Highbury ."
Mr. Woodhouse	Jane , do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley .
Mr. Woodhouse	"I mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative . "" "" Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all . "" "" Very odd !"
Mr. Woodhouse	"I told you he was plain . "" "" My dear , you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself-- "" "" Oh ! as for me , my judgment is worth nothing . Where I have a regard , I always think a person well - looking ."
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse was resigned .
Mr. Woodhouse	The time of year lightened the evil to him .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" It is very pretty , "" said Mr. Woodhouse ."
Mr. Woodhouse	Just as your drawings always are , my dear .
Mr. Woodhouse	I do not know any body who draws so well as you do .
Mr. Woodhouse	The only thing I do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" But , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"Look at the tree . "" "" But it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" You , sir , may say any thing , "" cried Mr. Elton , "" but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of Miss Smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit !"
Mr. Woodhouse	especially for her father 's being given a moment 's uneasiness about it
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas .
Mr. Woodhouse	"The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton 's absenting himself . It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them,-- "" Ah !"
Mr. Woodhouse	Not that I had any doubt before-- I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple .
Mr. Woodhouse	I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome . We have apple - dumplings , however , very often .
Mr. Woodhouse	Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming , and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could
Mr. Woodhouse	he have seen the heart , he would have cared very little for the lungs ; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil , without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either , he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry , and talked on with much self - contentment , totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I have the greatest pleasure , my dear Emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed . I know what thorough justice you will do it , and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.--I think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again ; but I will not delay you by a long preface.--We"
Mr. Woodhouse	"This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday , but it was an ungenial morning ; and though you will never own being affected by weather , I think every body feels a north - east wind.-- I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning , but had the comfort of hearing last night , by Mr. Perry , that it had not made him ill . "" Yours ever , "" A. W. "" [ To Mrs. Weston . ] WINDSOR - JULY ."
Mr. Woodhouse	I hope she is right.--In one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL .
Mr. Woodhouse	What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her !
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I can not agree with you , papa ; you know I can not ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"Mr. Weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ? "" "" A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own ?"
Mr. Woodhouse	It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her .
Mr. Woodhouse	Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it .
Mr. Woodhouse	I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see . Whenever
Mr. Woodhouse	goes over to see his daughter
Mr. Woodhouse	, you know , she will be hearing of us .
Mr. Woodhouse	"He will be able to tell her how we all are . """
Mr. Woodhouse	Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own .
Mr. Woodhouse	The backgammon - table was placed ; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary .
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella 's husband . He lived about a mile from Highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London . He had returned to a late dinner , after some days ' absence , and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square .
Mr. Woodhouse	It was a happy circumstance , and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time .
Mr. Woodhouse	"Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner , which always did him good ; and his many inquiries after "" poor Isabella "" and her children were answered most satisfactorily ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"When this was over , Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed , "" It is very kind of you , Mr. Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk . "" "" Not at all , sir ."
Mr. Woodhouse	It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" But you must have found it very damp and dirty ."
Mr. Woodhouse	"I wish you may not catch cold . "" "" Dirty , sir !"
Mr. Woodhouse	Look at my shoes .
Mr. Woodhouse	"Not a speck on them . "" "" Well !"
Mr. Woodhouse	that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" By the bye -- I have not wished you joy ."
Mr. Woodhouse	Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well .
Mr. Woodhouse	""""
Mr. Woodhouse	"I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two . "" "" Especially when _ one _ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature ! "" said Emma playfully ."
Mr. Woodhouse	""" That is what you have in your head , I know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by . "" """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" Dear Emma bears every thing so well , "" said her father ."
Mr. Woodhouse	""" We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor 's advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor 's time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore can not allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married . "" "" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me , "" said Emma , "" and a very considerable one -- that I made the match myself . I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing . "" Mr. Knightley shook his head at her ."
Mr. Woodhouse	my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass .
Mr. Woodhouse	If I had not promoted Mr. Weston 's visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him ."
Mr. Woodhouse	But if you want to shew him any attention , my dear , ask him to come and dine with us some day .
Mr. Woodhouse	That will be a much better thing .
Mr. Woodhouse	I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" "" With a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time , "" said Mr. Knightley , laughing , "" and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing . Invite him to dinner , Emma , and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken , but leave him to chuse his own wife ."
Mr. Woodhouse	He had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father 's comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded .
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No , he felt that it ought not to be attempted .
Mr. Woodhouse	He had given it , he could assure her , very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning , to have his thoughts to himself .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I am sure William Larkins will not like it ."
Mr. Woodhouse	You must get his consent before you ask mine .
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage . The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner . She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it .
Mr. Woodhouse	It was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room . For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself .
Mr. Woodhouse	yes , I must be there ; I could not refuse ; and I will keep as much awake as I can ; but I would rather be at home , looking over William Larkins 's week 's account ;
Mr. Woodhouse	He thought principally of Mrs. Churchill 's illness , and wanted to know how she was treated ; and as for the ball , it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed ; but they would all be safer at home .
Mr. Woodhouse	Mr. Woodhouse soon followed ; and the necessity of exertion made him composed .
Mr. Woodhouse	""" This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing 's being dull and insipid about the house!-- I must be in love ; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not -- for a few weeks at least ."
Anna Weston	It did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday . Vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges .
Anna Weston	"His father only called him a coxcomb , and thought it a very good story ; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it , was clear enough , by her passing it over as quickly as possible , and making no other comment than that "" all young people would have their little whims . """
Anna Weston	With the exception of this little blot , Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him .
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether . He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect .
Anna Weston	This was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference-- ( for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance .
Anna Weston	Mr. Weston , on his side , added a virtue to the account which must have some weight . He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly .
Anna Weston	"As Mrs. Weston observed , "" all young people would have their little whims . "" There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry , not so leniently disposed . In general he was judged , throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man-- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr. Knightley ."
Anna Weston	She had half a mind to resent ; but an instant 's observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass . Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr. and Mrs. Weston 's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune .
Anna Weston	. This lesson , she very much feared , they would receive only from herself ; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley , none of Mr. Weston .
Anna Weston	"Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and Mrs. Weston 's accounting for it with "" I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out , "" was not quite sufficient ."
Anna Weston	"Then turning to Mrs. Weston , with a look of gentle reproach--""Ah !"
Anna Weston	"Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me . """
Anna Weston	""" Well , sir , "" cried Mr. Weston , "" as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment , if you wish it . """
Anna Weston	Mr. Weston must be quiet , and every thing deliberately arranged .
Anna Weston	""" But , my dear sir , "" cried Mr. Weston , "" if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party ."
Anna Weston	You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ ten _ years .
Anna Weston	""" No , upon no account in the world , Mr. Weston ; I am much obliged to you for reminding me ."
Anna Weston	I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston , but on your account .
Anna Weston	Frank 's was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance . But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest .
Anna Weston	"Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment , and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance ; and the interesting employment had followed , of reckoning up exactly who there would be , and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple . """
Anna Weston	A word was put in for a second young Cox ; and at last , Mr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included , and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out , it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten , and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of .
Anna Weston	Emma said it would be awkward ; Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper ; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health
Anna Weston	So you would all .
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing .
Anna Weston	"I do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing ! """
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge .
Anna Weston	She knew the importance of it , and said every thing in her power to do it away .
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied . This is what we all feel .
Anna Weston	""" It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr. and Mrs. Weston do not ."
Anna Weston	"Dancing with open windows!--I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs. Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it . "" """
Anna Weston	"If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done . "" "" But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited-- "" "" Oh ! "" interrupted Emma , "" there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over ."
Anna Weston	"I do not know her , even by sight . "" "" I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs. Weston 's care ."
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole .
Anna Weston	` If _ Miss _ _ Taylor _ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir . '
Anna Weston	"I hope whenever poor Isabella 's little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry . "" "" My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment , "" said Frank Churchill , "" examining the capabilities of the house . I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . I was desired to say so from both ."
Anna Weston	"It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . They can do nothing satisfactorily without you . "" Emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown ."
Anna Weston	"There were Mr. and Mrs. Weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect . "" Emma , "" said she , "" this paper is worse than I expected ."
Anna Weston	the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined .
Anna Weston	""" "" My dear , you are too particular , "" said her husband ."
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage ; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper .
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper ; merely sandwiches , & c. , set out in the little room ; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion .
Anna Weston	A private dance , without sitting down to supper , was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women ; and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again .
Anna Weston	"She then took another line of expediency , and looking into the doubtful room , observed , "" I do not think it _ is _ so very small ."
Anna Weston	"And Mr. Weston at the same time , walking briskly with long steps through the passage , was calling out , "" You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear ."
Anna Weston	""" "" I wish , "" said Mrs. Weston , "" one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best ."
Anna Weston	You want your neighbours ' opinions . I do not wonder at you .
Anna Weston	""" "" Well -- if you please , "" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating , "" if you think she will be of any use . "" "" You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates , "" said Emma ."
Anna Weston	""" Here Mr. Weston joined them , and on hearing what was proposed , gave it his decided approbation ."
Anna Weston	I beg your pardon , sir .
Anna Weston	Long before he reappeared , attending the short , neat , brisk - moving aunt , and her elegant niece,--Mrs . Weston , like a sweet - tempered woman and a good wife , had examined the passage again , and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before-- indeed very trifling ; and here ended the difficulties of decision .
Anna Weston	All the minor arrangements of table and chair , lights and music , tea and supper , made themselves ; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Stokes.-- Every body invited , was certainly to come ; Frank had already written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight , which could not possibly be refused .
Anna Weston	"The party did not break up without Emma 's being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening , nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife , "" He has asked her , my dear ."
Anna Weston	"I knew he would ! """
Anna Weston	present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well .
Anna Weston	I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology , and is not offended .
Anna Weston	You see how delightfully she writes .
Anna Weston	she is a sweet creature !
Anna Weston	You would have doated on her , had you gone.--But not a word more .
Anna Weston	"Let us be discreet-- quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines-- I forget the poem at this moment : "" For when a lady 's in the case , "" You know all other things give place . "" Now I say , my dear , in _ our _ case , for _ lady _ , read----mum ! a word to the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits , an't I ? But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My _ representation , you see , has quite appeased her ."
Anna Weston	"When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs. Weston , she found herself abruptly addressed with , "" Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit?--(here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane ."
Anna Weston	XII Mr. Knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of Mr. Woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella 's first day .
Anna Weston	Emma 's sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation .
Anna Weston	_ She _ certainly had not been in the wrong , and _ he _ would never own that he had .
Anna Weston	Concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to Hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt 's arms .
Anna Weston	The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest .
Anna Weston	We are so very airy !
Anna Weston	I should be unwilling , I own , to live in any other part of the town;-- there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in : but _ we _ are so remarkably airy!--Mr . Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air .
Anna Weston	my dear , as Perry says , where health is at stake , nothing else should be considered ; and if one is to travel , there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all , better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air .
Anna Weston	"I should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path . . . . The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps . I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion . "" Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;-- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it ."
Anna Weston	I hope it is a dry situation , and that her health will be taken good care of . It ought to be a first object , as I am sure poor Miss Taylor 's always was with me .
Anna Weston	You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us .
Anna Weston	Nature gave you understanding:-- Miss Taylor gave you principles .
Anna Weston	"And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen . "" "" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks--`Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor 's leave'--something which , you knew , I did not approve ."
Anna Weston	""" This is a pleasure , "" said he , in rather a low voice , "" coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated . You find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think I shall succeed . "" "" What ! "" said Mrs. Weston , "" have not you finished it yet ?"
Anna Weston	"This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come . I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home . """
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston had been delighted before , and was delighted again ; Emma joined her in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of the
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment .
Anna Weston	""" He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged Miss Fairfax , who was still sitting at it , to play something more . """
Anna Weston	I will not open the window here ; it would give you all cold ; but I can go into my mother 's room you know .
Anna Weston	So obliged to you for the carriage last night . We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us .
Anna Weston	"The listeners were amused ; and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning . But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism . "" So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage , "" resumed Miss Bates . He cut her short with , "" I am going to Kingston . Can I do any thing for you ?"
Anna Weston	"dear , Kingston -- are you?--Mrs . Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston . """
Anna Weston	""" Mrs. Cole has servants to send ."
Anna Weston	""" And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful ; so many friends ! """
Anna Weston	Emma found it really time to be at home ; the visit had already lasted long ; and on examining watches , so much of the morning was perceived to be gone , that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also , could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates , before they set off for Randalls .
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best .
Anna Weston	She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother 's unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home . They lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston , and Miss Churchill of Enscombe .
Anna Weston	Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .
Anna Weston	The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr. Weston 's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear .
Anna Weston	For a few days , every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received .
Anna Weston	""" I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston ?"
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma 's losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour 's ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr. Weston 's disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor , ' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .
Anna Weston	There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston 's wedding - cake in their hands : but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it .
Anna Weston	He came with Mrs. Weston , to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially .
Anna Weston	"He had been sitting with her , it appeared , most companionably at home , till her usual hour of exercise ; and on being desired to chuse their walk , immediately fixed on Highbury.--""He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same ."
Anna Weston	"Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction . ""-- Highbury , with Mrs. Weston , stood for Hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him . They walked thither directly ."
Anna Weston	She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs. Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend .
Anna Weston	""" And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ? "" "" Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs. Weston , is it ?"
Anna Weston	"I like them all . "" "" You know Miss Fairfax 's situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ? "" "" Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do . "" "" You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , "" said Mrs. Weston smiling ; "" remember that I am here.--Mr . Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax 's situation in life ."
Anna Weston	"I will move a little farther off . "" "" I certainly do forget to think of _ her _ , "" said Emma , "" as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend . """
Anna Weston	The man must be a blockhead who wanted more . Mrs. Weston laughed , and said he did not know what he was talking about .
Anna Weston	He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends .
Anna Weston	Could I mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to Mrs. Goddard ?
Anna Weston	Then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day .
Anna Weston	"When Mr. Weston joined the party , however , and when the baby was fetched , there was no longer a want of subject or animation-- or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say , "" I have to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs. Weston 's letters . I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon . I hope you do not retract what you then said ."
Anna Weston	""" Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston doat upon her ."
Anna Weston	"I should certainly have called at Hartfield , had you failed to come . "" The others had been talking of the child , Mrs. Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant 's appearing not quite well ."
Anna Weston	""" Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy.-- She had some fears of his horse . Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.-- A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question ."
Anna Weston	Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared . Mr. Weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation .
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa .
Anna Weston	"and she had difficulty in behaving with temper . He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance , "" Would not she give him her support?--would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard 's till it were certain that Miss Smith 's disorder had no infection ?"
Anna Weston	"I am sure of your kind support and aid . "" Emma saw Mrs. Weston 's surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose ."
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son - in - law , who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly .
Anna Weston	""" I admired your resolution very much , sir , "" said he , "" in venturing out in such weather , for of course you saw there would be snow very soon ."
Anna Weston	I admired your spirit ; and I dare say we shall get home very well .
Anna Weston	""" Mr. Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away ."
Anna Weston	As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty .
Anna Weston	""" Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan ."
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston could only approve .
Anna Weston	"minutes more , and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over . The carriage came : and Mr. Woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for . """
Anna Weston	She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston 's good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense .
Anna Weston	I have thought only of you .
Anna Weston	Every thing that I have said or done , for many weeks past , has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself .
Anna Weston	You can not really , seriously , doubt it .
Anna Weston	No!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me .
Anna Weston	As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings-- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared , ) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent .
Anna Weston	Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought seriously of her ?
Anna Weston	She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together .
Anna Weston	"John Knightley looked at him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and said , "" I could not have believed it even of _ him _ . "" Mr. Weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room . He gave her a letter , it was from Frank , and to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it . "" Read it , read it , "" said he , "" it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma . "" The two ladies looked over it together ; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time , in a voice a little subdued , but very audible to every body ."
Anna Weston	"Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now . I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way . "" Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion ."
Anna Weston	Her looks and words had nothing to restrain them .
Anna Weston	She was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy . Her congratulations were warm and open ; but Emma could not speak so fluently .
Anna Weston	Mr. Weston , however , too eager to be very observant , too communicative to want others to talk , was very well satisfied with what she did say , and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already .
Anna Weston	They were the first entitled , after Mrs. Weston and Emma , to be made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her .
Anna Weston	"On his side were the inquiries,--""Was she a horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?-- Pleasant walks?--Had they a large neighbourhood?--Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough?--There"
Anna Weston	He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor 's merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse 's character , than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor 's .
Anna Weston	And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person .
Anna Weston	Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley , she was more conscience - stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been.--Mr
Anna Weston	You really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself.--To the post - office indeed ! Mrs. Weston , did you ever hear the like ?
Anna Weston	"You and I must positively exert our authority . "" "" My advice , "" said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively , "" I certainly do feel tempted to give ."
Anna Weston	The spring I always think requires more than common care .
Anna Weston	Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable .
Anna Weston	""" You are extremely kind , "" said Jane ; "" but I can not give up my early walk ."
Anna Weston	""" My dear Jane , say no more about it . The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master . You know , Mrs. Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves ."
Anna Weston	"If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . "" "" Excuse me , "" said Jane earnestly , "" I can not by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant ."
Anna Weston	"And so does poor Mrs. Weston""--with half a sigh and half a smile at her ."
Anna Weston	""" I never saw any gentleman 's handwriting""--Emma began , looking also at Mrs. Weston ; but stopped , on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending to some one else -- and the pause gave her time to reflect , "" Now , how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ?"
Anna Weston	""" Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--""Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman 's hands I ever saw ."
Anna Weston	"Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce ? """
Anna Weston	"I have a note of his.-- Do not you remember , Mrs. Weston , employing him to write for you one day ? "" "" He chose to say he was employed""-- "" Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley . """
Anna Weston	"I have a note of his.-- Do not you remember , Mrs. Weston , employing him to write for you one day ? "" "" He chose to say he was employed""-- "" Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley . """
Anna Weston	XIV Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs. Weston 's drawing - room;--Mr
Anna Weston	Mr. Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself . She could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour 's uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each .
Anna Weston	This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day 's visit might not afford , which certainly did not belong to the present half - hour ; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston , her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful to Emma , and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton 's oddities , or of any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost
Anna Weston	had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs. Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma .
Anna Weston	"Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of "" Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!""-- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs. Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners ."
Anna Weston	"She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words "" my son , "" and "" Frank , "" and "" my son , "" repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward ."
Anna Weston	He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her . She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations . With such sensations , Mr. Elton 's civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--
Anna Weston	"for when happily released from Mr. Elton , and seated by Mr. Weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her , "" We want only two more to be just the right number ."
Anna Weston	""" He has been wanting to come to us , "" continued Mr. Weston , "" ever since September : every letter has been full of it ; but he can not command his own time ."
Anna Weston	But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January .
Anna Weston	""" "" What a very great pleasure it will be to you !"
Anna Weston	"and Mrs. Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him , that she must be almost as happy as yourself . "" "" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off ."
Anna Weston	She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do .
Anna Weston	I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January , as I am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at Hartfield , that she can not calculate on their effects , as I have been long in the practice of doing .
Anna Weston	""" "" I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case , "" replied Emma ; "" but am disposed to side with you , Mr. Weston ."
Anna Weston	If you think he will come , I shall think so too ; for you know Enscombe .
Anna Weston	""" Yes -- I have some right to that knowledge ; though I have never been at the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But"
Anna Weston	""" Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs. Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy-- yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.-- Mrs. Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : "" for I can not depend upon his coming ."
Anna Weston	I can not be so sanguine as Mr. Weston .
Anna Weston	I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing .
Anna Weston	Mr. Weston , I dare say , has been
Anna Weston	telling you exactly how the matter stands ?
Anna Weston	""" Yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of Mrs. Churchill , which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world . """
Anna Weston	""" My Emma ! "" replied Mrs. Weston , smiling , "" what is the certainty of caprice ? """
Anna Weston	"Then turning to Isabella , who had not been attending before--""You must know , my dear Mrs. Knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks . It depends entirely upon his aunt 's spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper ."
Anna Weston	Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe , and is a very odd - tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends upon her being willing to spare him .
Anna Weston	""" Oh , Mrs. Churchill ; every body knows Mrs. Churchill , "" replied Isabella : "" and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion ."
Anna Weston	What a blessing , that she never had any children !
Anna Weston	"Poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them ! """
Anna Weston	Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston . She should then have heard more : Mrs. Weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge .
Anna Weston	"While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying , "" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain ."
Anna Weston	I can not bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves .
Anna Weston	They are jealous even of his regard for his father .
Anna Weston	In short , I can feel no dependence on his coming , and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine .
Anna Weston	""" "" He ought to come , "" said Emma ."
Anna Weston	""" If he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man 's not having it in his power to do as much as that ."
Anna Weston	""" One ought to be at Enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do , "" replied Mrs. Weston ."
Anna Weston	""" One ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but Enscombe , I believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _ she _ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her . "" "" But she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite . Now , according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _ him _ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all . "" "" My dearest Emma , do not pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a bad one , or to lay down rules for it : you must let it go its own way . I have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _ when _ it will be . """
Anna Weston	"Emma listened , and then coolly said , "" I shall not be satisfied , unless he comes . """
Anna Weston	""" He may have a great deal of influence on some points , "" continued Mrs. Weston , "" and on others , very little : and among those , on which she is beyond his reach , it is but too likely , may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us . """
Anna Weston	In this state of suspense they were befriended , not by any sudden illumination of Mr. Woodhouse 's mind , or any wonderful change of his nervous system , but by the operation of the same system in another way.-- Mrs. Weston 's poultry - house was robbed one night of all her turkeys-- evidently by the ingenuity of man . Other poultry - yards in the neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _ housebreaking _ to Mr. Woodhouse 's fears.--He was very uneasy ; and but for the sense of his son - in - law 's protection , would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life .
Anna Weston	"It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude . "" And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ? "" said Mr. Weston ."
Anna Weston	and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _ him _ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon.-- Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way , Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed . Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .
Anna Weston	The anxious cares , the incessant attentions of Mrs. Weston , were not thrown away .
Anna Weston	When she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but Mr. Elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by
Anna Weston	"kind - hearted , gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say , "" Do not you dance , Mr. Elton ? "" to which his prompt reply was , "" Most readily , Mrs. Weston , if you will dance with me ."
Anna Weston	""" Me!--oh ! no -- I would get you a better partner than myself ."
Anna Weston	"I am no dancer . """
Anna Weston	You will excuse me .
Anna Weston	Any thing else I should be most happy to do , at your command -- but my dancing days are over .
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston said no more ; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat .
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet .
Anna Weston	She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage , though every thing has been done -- One door nailed up -- Quantities of matting --
Anna Weston	"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted,""--observed Mrs. Weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover.--""The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes ."
Anna Weston	"It is the fault of her face that she has them not . "" "" Do you think so ? "" replied he ."
Anna Weston	""" I can not agree with you ."
Anna Weston	Emma and Harriet were going to walk ; he joined them ; and , on returning , they fell in with a larger party , who , like themselves , judged it wisest to take their exercise early , as the weather threatened rain ; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son , Miss Bates and her niece , who had accidentally met .
Anna Weston	""" By the bye , "" said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently , "" what became of Mr. Perry 's plan of setting up his carriage ? """
Anna Weston	"Mrs. Weston looked surprized , and said , "" I did not know that he ever had any such plan . "" "" Nay , I had it from you ."
Anna Weston	You wrote me word of it three months ago .
Anna Weston	""" Me ! impossible ! "" "" Indeed you did ."
Anna Weston	I remember it perfectly .
Anna Weston	You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon .
Anna Weston	You must remember it now ?
Anna Weston	""" Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment . "" "" Never !"
Anna Weston	really , never!--Bless me !
Anna Weston	how could it be?--Then I must have dreamt it -- but I was completely persuaded --
Anna Weston	"Miss Smith , you walk as if you were tired . You will not be sorry to find yourself at home . """
Anna Weston	""" What is this?--What is this ? "" cried Mr. Weston , "" about Perry and a carriage ?"
Anna Weston	I am glad he can afford it .
Anna Weston	""" No , sir , "" replied his son , laughing , "" I seem to have had it from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston 's having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream . I am a great dreamer ."
Anna Weston	I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away-- and when I have gone through my particular friends , then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry .
Anna Weston	""" "" It is odd though , "" observed his father , "" that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe ."
Anna Weston	Perry 's setting up his carriage ! and his wife 's persuading him to it , out of care for his health-- just what will happen , I have no doubt , some time or other ; only a little premature .
Anna Weston	"Emma , you are a great dreamer , I think ? """
Anna Weston	She had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance , and was beyond the reach of Mr. Weston 's hint .
Anna Weston	"The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the "" poor little boys , "" or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it . Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax ."
Anna Weston	My dear sir , you are too obliging .
Anna Weston	you amuse me excessively .
Anna Weston	I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do-- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do .
Anna Weston	There is no admiration between them , I do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather of a totally different nature-- it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of nonsense in it -- but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be .
Anna Weston	That is , I _ presume _ it to be so on her side , and I can _ answer _ for its being so on his .
Anna Weston	"I will answer for the gentleman 's indifference . """
Anna Weston	The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs. Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury;--to Hartfield of course . They were stopping , however , in the first place at Mrs. Bates 's ; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford 's ; and had all but knocked , when Emma caught their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her ; and the agreeableness of yesterday 's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting .
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses , in order to hear the new instrument .
Anna Weston	""" For my companion tells me , "" said she , "" that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning ."
Anna Weston	I was not aware of it myself .
Anna Weston	I did not know that I had fixed a day , but as he says I did , I am going now .
Anna Weston	""" And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope , "" said Frank Churchill , "" to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield-- if you are going home ."
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston was disappointed .
Anna Weston	""" I thought you meant to go with me ."
Anna Weston	But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument .
Anna Weston	I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston .
Anna Weston	She might do very well by herself .
Anna Weston	A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood .
Anna Weston	""" "" Do come with me , "" said Mrs. Weston , "" if it be not very disagreeable to you ."
Anna Weston	"and I always thought you meant it . "" He could say no more ; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates 's door ."
Anna Weston	"Voices approached the shop -- or rather one voice and two ladies : Mrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door . """
Anna Weston	How do you do , Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me , that I might be sure of succeeding .
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston told me you were here.-- Oh !
Anna Weston	Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me .
Anna Weston	Well , Mrs. Weston , you have prevailed , I hope , and these ladies will oblige us .
Anna Weston	I do congratulate you , Mrs. Weston , most warmly .
Anna Weston	""" Pray take care , Mrs. Weston , there is a step at the turning ."
Anna Weston	She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of ; and , for his sake , greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston ; she was very often thinking of him , and quite impatient for a letter , that she might know how he was , how were his spirits , how was his aunt , and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring . But , on the other hand , she could not admit herself to be unhappy , nor , after the first morning , to be less disposed for employment than usual ; she was still busy and cheerful ; and , pleasing as he was , she could yet imagine him to have faults ; and farther , though thinking of him so much , and , as she sat drawing or working , forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment , fancying interesting dialogues , and inventing elegant letters ; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _ refused _ _ him _ .
Anna Weston	When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived , Emma had the perusal of it ; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations , and think she had undervalued their strength .
Anna Weston	No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern ; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston ; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe , the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt , and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm of her own name was not wanting . _ Miss _ _ Woodhouse _ appeared more than once , and never without a something of pleasing connexion , either a compliment to her taste , or a remembrance of what she had said ; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye , unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry , she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed .
Anna Weston	His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated ; Mrs. Churchill was recovering , and he dared not yet , even in his own imagination , fix a time for coming to Randalls again . Gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part , its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to Mrs. Weston , that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer , and that he must learn to do without her . Her intentions were unchanged .
Anna Weston	With Mr. Weston 's ball in view at least , there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things ; but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach -- new carriage , bell - ringing , and all .
Anna Weston	"X One morning , about ten days after Mrs. Churchill 's decease , Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston , who "" could not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak with her . ""-- He met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father , "" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do , if it be possible . Mrs. Weston wants to see you ."
Anna Weston	She must see you .
Anna Weston	""" "" Is she unwell ? "" "" No , no , not at all -- only a little agitated ."
Anna Weston	"She would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _ alone _ , and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come ? """
Anna Weston	"But what can be the matter?-- Is she really not ill ? "" "" Depend upon me -- but ask no more questions ."
Anna Weston	Something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls .
Anna Weston	"They hurried on , and were speedily at Randalls.--""Well , my dear , "" said he , as they entered the room--""I have brought her , and now I hope you will soon be better ."
Anna Weston	"I shall not be far off , if you want me . ""-- And Emma distinctly heard him add , in a lower tone , before he quitted the room,--""I have been as good as my word . She has not the least idea . """
Anna Weston	"Mrs. Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma 's uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said , "" What is it my dear friend ?"
Anna Weston	Something of a very unpleasant nature , I find , has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is . I have been walking all this way in complete suspense .
Anna Weston	""" Have you indeed no idea ? "" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice ."
Anna Weston	""" Can not you , my dear Emma -- cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear ?"
Anna Weston	"It does relate to him , and I will tell you directly ; "" ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up . )"
Anna Weston	"He came to speak to his father on a subject,--to announce an attachment-- "" She stopped to breathe ."
Anna Weston	""" More than an attachment , indeed , "" resumed Mrs. Weston ; "" an engagement-- a positive engagement.--What will you say , Emma -- what will any body say , when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged;--nay , that they have been long engaged ! """
Anna Weston	You are not serious ?
Anna Weston	You do not mean it ?
Anna Weston	""" "" You may well be amazed , "" returned Mrs. Weston , still averting her eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that Emma might have time to recover-- "" You may well be amazed ."
Anna Weston	I can hardly believe it.-- I thought I knew him .
Anna Weston	""" Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me , Emma , very much . It has hurt his father equally ."
Anna Weston	"Emma pondered a moment , and then replied , "" I will not pretend _ not _ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of . "" Mrs. Weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but Emma 's countenance was as steady as her words ."
Anna Weston	This is the simple truth .
Anna Weston	""" Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy ; and when she could find utterance , assured her , that this protestation had done"
Anna Weston	her more good than any thing else in the world could do
Anna Weston	"It was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other -- and we were persuaded that it was so.-- Imagine what we have been feeling on your account . "" "" I have escaped ; and that I should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself . But this does not acquit _ him _ , Mrs. Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame ."
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston -- it is too calm a censure .
Anna Weston	""" "" Nay , dear Emma , now I must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , I have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and-- "" "" Good God ! "" cried Emma , not attending to her.--""Mrs . Smallridge , too !"
Anna Weston	On this article I can fully acquit him .
Anna Weston	It was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.-- Till yesterday , I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans .
Anna Weston	They burst on him , I do not know how , but by some letter or message--
Anna Weston	"and it was the discovery of what she was doing , of this very project of hers , which determined him to come forward at once , own it all to his uncle , throw himself on his kindness , and , in short , put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long . "" Emma began to listen better . "" I am to hear from him soon , "" continued Mrs. Weston ."
Anna Weston	""" He told me at parting , that he should soon write ; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now ."
Anna Weston	I must love him ; and now that I am satisfied on one point , the one material point , I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may . They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment .
Anna Weston	While poor Mrs. Churchill lived , I suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility;--but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required .
Anna Weston	"He stopped at Highbury , at the Bates 's , I fancy , some time -- and then came on hither ; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle , to whom he is just now more necessary than ever , that , as I tell you , he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.-- He was very much agitated -- very much , indeed -- to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.--In addition to all the rest , there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell , which he had had no previous suspicion of-- and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal . """
Anna Weston	""" "" I am quite easy on that head , "" replied Mrs. Weston ."
Anna Weston	""" I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other , which both might not have heard . """
Anna Weston	""" You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady . """
Anna Weston	"His wife gave him a look which invited him in ; and , while he was coming round , added , "" Now , dearest Emma , let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease , and incline him to be satisfied with the match . Let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may"
Anna Weston	"and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him , for Frank , I mean , that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for-- and still am disposed to give her credit for , in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right . And how much may be said in her situation for even that error ! """
Anna Weston	She opened the packet ; it was too surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself , ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston .
Anna Weston	"This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday , but it was an ungenial morning ; and though you will never own being affected by weather , I think every body feels a north - east wind.-- I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning , but had the comfort of hearing last night , by Mr. Perry , that it had not made him ill . "" Yours ever , "" A. W. "" [ To Mrs. Weston . ] WINDSOR - JULY ."
Anna Weston	Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor 's judgment , but directed chiefly by her own .
Anna Weston	The real evils , indeed , of Emma 's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments . The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .
Anna Weston	Sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married .
Anna Weston	It was Miss Taylor 's loss which first brought grief .
Anna Weston	It was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance .
Anna Weston	The wedding over , and the bride - people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening . Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost .
Anna Weston	Highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which Hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals .
Anna Weston	The Woodhouses were first in consequence there .
Anna Weston	"Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could , to keep him from such thoughts ; but when tea came , it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner , "" Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again ."
Anna Weston	"Mr. Weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ? "" "" A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own ?"
Anna Weston	"This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours , my dear . """
Anna Weston	""" How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us!--We shall be always meeting !"
Anna Weston	"_ We _ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon . "" "" My dear , how am I to get so far ?"
Anna Weston	I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .
Anna Weston	"Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner , which always did him good ; and his many inquiries after "" poor Isabella "" and her children were answered most satisfactorily ."
Anna Weston	And after such success , you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again . Oh dear , no !
Anna Weston	"You are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference . "" "" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others , "" rejoined Mr. Woodhouse , understanding but in part ."
Anna Weston	""" But , my dear , pray do not make any more matches ; they are silly things , and break up one 's family circle grievously . "" "" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr. Elton ."
Anna Weston	You like Mr. Elton , papa,--I must look about for a wife for him .
Anna Weston	There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him -- and he has been here a whole year , and has fitted up his house so comfortably , that it would be a shame to have him single any longer -- and I thought when he was joining their hands to - day , he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him !
Anna Weston	""" Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him ."
Anna Weston	XV This letter must make its way to Emma 's feelings . She was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold .
Anna Weston	, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever .
Anna Weston	She was sure of Mrs. Weston 's wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr. Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct .
Anna Weston	XII One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma -- its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill 's stay in Surry ; for , in spite of Mr. Weston 's confidence , she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight .
Anna Weston	All was safe and prosperous ; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another , Emma , being now certain of her ball , began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley 's provoking indifference about it .
Anna Weston	Either because he did not dance himself , or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted , he seemed resolved that it should not interest him , determined against its exciting any present curiosity , or affording him any future amusement .
Anna Weston	No!--she was more and more convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise .
Anna Weston	Alas ! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley .
Anna Weston	The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma , in a note from Mrs. Weston , instantly .
Anna Weston	"Mrs. Weston added , "" that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon . "" This wretched note was the finale of Emma 's breakfast . When once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim . The loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man-- and all that the young man might be feeling!--It"
Anna Weston	"Mr. Weston , always alert when business was to be done , and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable , as of foreseeing any that was doubtful , said , "" It was time to go ; "" and the young man , though he might and did sigh , could not but agree , to take leave . "" I shall hear about you all , "" said he ; "" that is my chief consolation . I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you ."
Anna Weston	I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me . She has been so kind as to promise it .
Anna Weston	the blessing of a female correspondent , when one is really interested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing .
Anna Weston	"In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again . "" A very friendly shake of the hand , a very earnest "" Good - bye , "" closed the speech , and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill ."
Anna Weston	Frank Churchill came back again ; and if he kept his father 's dinner waiting , it was not known at Hartfield ; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse , to betray any imperfection which could be concealed .
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston , kind - hearted and musical , was particularly interested by the circumstance , and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine 's countenance .
Anna Weston	He was gone immediately ; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of Miss Fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing . Before he could return to his chair , it was taken by Mrs. Weston .
Anna Weston	""" This is the luxury of a large party , "" said she:--""one can get near every body , and say every thing ."
Anna Weston	My dear Emma , I am longing to talk to you .
Anna Weston	""" Well , "" said Mrs. Weston , smiling , "" you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again . The more I think of it , the more probable it appears ."
Anna Weston	In short , I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax .
Anna Weston	""" Dear Mrs. Weston , how could you think of such a thing?--Mr . Knightley!--Mr . Knightley must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--"
Anna Weston	""" I see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention ."
Anna Weston	My dear Mrs. Weston , do not take to match - making .
Anna Weston	You do it very ill .
Anna Weston	""" "" Imprudent , if you please -- but not mad . Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable . "" "" But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry ."
Anna Weston	I am sure he has not the least idea of it .
Anna Weston	"He would do any good to her , or her family ; but-- "" "" Well , "" said Mrs. Weston , laughing , "" perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give Jane such a respectable home ."
Anna Weston	""" If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion ."
Anna Weston	""" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so . "" "" There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma . I have a very strong notion that it comes from him ."
Anna Weston	I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner .
Anna Weston	""" "" You take up an idea , Mrs. Weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . I see no sign of attachment-- I believe nothing of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax . """
Anna Weston	They combated the point some time longer in the same way ; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend ; for Mrs. Weston was the most used of the two to yield ; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over , and the instrument in preparation;-- and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it .
Anna Weston	Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr. Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .
Anna Weston	They sang together once more ; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own .
Anna Weston	But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half Emma 's mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs. Weston 's suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions .
Anna Weston	They talked at first only of the performance . His admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for Mrs. Weston , it would not have struck her .
Anna Weston	Mrs. Weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top .
Anna Weston	"After some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston , look sorrowful , and have done . "" Perhaps it is as well , "" said Frank Churchill , as he attended Emma to her carriage ."
Harriet Smith	Harriet was to be there in the evening , and the Bateses .
Harriet Smith	Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence . Might not the evening end in a dance ? had been a question of his .
Harriet Smith	"You must promise me not to sit up . "" He did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual ."
Harriet Smith	Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly , exclusively , passionately loved by Mr. Knightley . _ She _ could not .
Harriet Smith	They had gone , in short -- and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady .
Harriet Smith	She had hardly been able to speak a word , and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness .
Harriet Smith	The quiet , heart - felt satisfaction of the old lady , and the rapturous delight of her daughter -- who proved even too joyous to talk as usual , had been a gratifying , yet almost an affecting , scene .
Harriet Smith	She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause . Had she followed Mr. Knightley 's known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now.--Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax 's confidence on this important matter-- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane 's feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill 's .
Harriet Smith	As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty . A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion .
Harriet Smith	Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody .
Harriet Smith	Somebody had placed her , several years back , at Mrs. Goddard 's school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder .
Harriet Smith	This was all that was generally known of her history .
Harriet Smith	She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury , and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her .
Harriet Smith	She was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired .
Harriet Smith	She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .
Harriet Smith	She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith 's conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement . Encouragement should be given . Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions . The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her .
Harriet Smith	She _ would notice her ; she would improve her ;
Harriet Smith	she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners .
Harriet Smith	The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions .
Harriet Smith	Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last !
Harriet Smith	"You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five , "" had been repeated many times over ."
Harriet Smith	You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room .
Harriet Smith	XVI It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting .
Harriet Smith	Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate.-- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke . She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella 's invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss .
Harriet Smith	Harriet really wished , and had wished some time , to consult a dentist .
Harriet Smith	Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister 's side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable.-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse 's carriage.--It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square .
Harriet Smith	The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard 's , or in London , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma 's sensations ; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself
Harriet Smith	She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied .
Harriet Smith	"It would be a _ secret _ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate . She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.-- The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name.-- She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , "" Beg her to walk up;""--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging ."
Harriet Smith	How they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter 's carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also .
Harriet Smith	Harriet , Mr. Elton , and Mr. Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr. Woodhouse 's habits and inclination being consulted in every thing .
Harriet Smith	The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house .
Harriet Smith	Emma called on her the next day , and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls . She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat : Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection , Mr. Perry was talked of , and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement , though she could not speak of her loss without many tears .
Harriet Smith	Emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in Mrs. Goddard 's unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton 's would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much . She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard 's door , when she was met by Mr. Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid-- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield-- they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for . They joined company and proceeded together .
Harriet Smith	"Emma was just describing the nature of her friend 's complaint;-- "" a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them . """
Harriet Smith	"Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he exclaimed , "" A sore - throat!--I hope not infectious . I hope not of a putrid infectious sort . Has Perry seen her ?"
Harriet Smith	Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend .
Harriet Smith	"Let me entreat you to run no risks . Why does not Perry see her ? """
Harriet Smith	"Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her 's , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;-- but Emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being "" very cold , certainly very cold , "" and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening ."
Harriet Smith	""" Well , "" said she to herself , "" this is most strange!--After I had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination-- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with Mr. Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with Harriet ; but still , he can not refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked . What a strange thing love is !"
Harriet Smith	"he can see ready wit in Harriet , but will not dine alone for her . "" Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard 's for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour ."
Harriet Smith	Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her .
Harriet Smith	Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party .
Harriet Smith	no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard 's door , which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress , I was told that Miss Smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse . Very much grieved and concerned-- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning .
Harriet Smith	""" Emma smiled and answered--""My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , I hope ; but not even I can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed ."
Harriet Smith	"Mr. Perry has been with her , as you probably heard . "" "" Yes -- I imagined -- that is -- I did not-- "" "" He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report ."
Harriet Smith	""" Dreadful!--Exactly so , indeed.--She will be missed every moment ."
Harriet Smith	"Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence , and were sitting with her father.--Mr . Knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said , "" I would not go away without seeing you , but I have no time to spare , and therefore must now be gone directly ."
Harriet Smith	Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command . What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing .
Harriet Smith	Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance .
Harriet Smith	At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma 's side .
Harriet Smith	It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet 's opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a first wish . She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration . She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield .
Harriet Smith	""" And can not you call me ` George ' now ? "" "" Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but ` Mr. Knightley . ' I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton , by calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise , "" she added presently , laughing and blushing--""I will promise to call you once by your Christian name . I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better , for worse . "" Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith ; but it was too tender a subject.--She"
Harriet Smith	not enter on it.-- Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them .
Harriet Smith	This , on his side , might merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their friendship were declining .
Harriet Smith	The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy .
Harriet Smith	Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .
Harriet Smith	Emma 's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by Harriet 's being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least .
Harriet Smith	Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .
Harriet Smith	""" John does not even mention your friend , "" said Mr. Knightley ."
Harriet Smith	Perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to Harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject .
Harriet Smith	"They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet , and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject , if possible . She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr. Knightley startled her , by saying , "" You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity.--You are wise -- but _ I _ can not be wise ."
Harriet Smith	She might assist his resolution , or reconcile him to it ; she might give just praise to Harriet , or , by representing to him his own independence , relieve him from that state of indecision , which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.--They
Harriet Smith	""" While he spoke , Emma 's mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word-- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet 's hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet 's secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not.--It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two-- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not . She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain ."
Harriet Smith	Mrs. Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all . Emma had feelings , less of curiosity than of pride or propriety , to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects ; and she made a point of Harriet 's going with her , that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible . She could not enter the house again , could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to lace up her boot , without _ recollecting _ .
Harriet Smith	Compliments , charades , and horrible blunders ; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too ; but she behaved very well , and was only rather pale and silent .
Harriet Smith	"The woman was better off ; she might have the assistance of fine clothes , and the privilege of bashfulness , but the man had only his own good sense to depend on ; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married , the woman he had wanted to marry , and the woman whom he had been expected to marry , she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise , and to be as much affectedly , and as little really easy as could be . "" Well , Miss Woodhouse , "" said Harriet , when they had quitted the house , and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ;"
Harriet Smith	""" I dare say , "" returned Harriet , sighing again , "" I dare say she was very much attached to him . "" "" Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man 's fate to marry the woman who loves him best . Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have . "" "" Yes , "" said Harriet earnestly , "" and well she might , nobody could ever have a better ."
Harriet Smith	Well , I wish them happy with all my heart .
Harriet Smith	And now , Miss Woodhouse , I do not think I shall mind seeing them again .
Harriet Smith	No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery .
Harriet Smith	From Harriet 's happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father 's being present to engage Mr. Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady 's conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good . Harriet would have been a better match .
Harriet Smith	"The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove , "" My brother Mr. Suckling 's seat;""--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove ."
Harriet Smith	Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am .
Harriet Smith	I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove .
Harriet Smith	I absolutely must go in by myself , though I hate being stuck up in the barouche - landau without a companion ; but Augusta , I believe , with her own good - will , would never stir beyond the park paling . '
Harriet Smith	Many a time has she said so ; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion .
Harriet Smith	I think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little . I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse-- ( looking towards Mr. Woodhouse ) , Your father 's state of health must be a great drawback .
Harriet Smith	that 's a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give .
Harriet Smith	In my Bath life , I have seen such instances of it !
Harriet Smith	And it is so cheerful a place , that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse 's spirits , which , I understand , are sometimes much depressed . And as to its recommendations to _ you _ , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them .
Harriet Smith	It would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place .
Harriet Smith	"A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , Mrs. Partridge , the lady I have always resided with when in Bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with . "" It was as much as Emma could bear , without being impolite ."
Harriet Smith	I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs. Elton .
Harriet Smith	""" Oh ! no , indeed ; I must protest against any such idea ."
Harriet Smith	A superior performer!--very far from it , I assure you .
Harriet Smith	I am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _ mediocre _ to the last degree . You , Miss Woodhouse , I well know , play delightfully . I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into .
Harriet Smith	I absolutely can not do without music .
Harriet Smith	It is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at Maple Grove and in Bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice .
Harriet Smith	I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the house too -- knowing what I had been accustomed to -- of course he was not wholly without apprehension . When he was speaking of it in that way , I honestly said that _ the _ _ world _ I could give up -- parties , balls , plays -- for I had no fear of retirement . Blessed with so many resources within myself , the world was not necessary to _ me _ .
Harriet Smith	I could do very well without it .
Harriet Smith	To those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent .
Harriet Smith	And as to smaller - sized rooms than I had been used to , I really could not give it a thought .
Harriet Smith	I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description .
Harriet Smith	Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove ; but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , nor were spacious apartments .
Harriet Smith	` But , ' said I , ` to be quite honest , I do not think I can live without something of a musical society . I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me . '
Harriet Smith	""" No , indeed , I have no doubts at all on that head ."
Harriet Smith	I am delighted to find myself in such a circle .
Harriet Smith	I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together .
Harriet Smith	I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours . Will not it be a good plan ?
Harriet Smith	If _ we _ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies .
Harriet Smith	Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _ me _ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know-- there is a sad story against them , in general .
Harriet Smith	I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady .
Harriet Smith	I could not have believed it !
Harriet Smith	And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club !
Harriet Smith	And Mrs. Weston!-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman ! Worse and worse .
Harriet Smith	I never met with her equal .
Harriet Smith	Much beyond my hopes .
Harriet Smith	Harriet is disgraced by any comparison .
Harriet Smith	what would Frank Churchill say to her , if he were here ?
Harriet Smith	there I am-- thinking of him directly
Harriet Smith	How I catch myself out !
Harriet Smith	"Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind!""-- All this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the Eltons ' departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending ."
Harriet Smith	But I believe I am nice ; I do not like strange voices ; and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor .
Harriet Smith	However , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife . Though I think he had better not have married .
Harriet Smith	I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion ; I said that I hoped I _ should _ in the course of the summer . But I ought to have gone before .
Harriet Smith	it shews what a sad invalid I am !
Harriet Smith	But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane .
Harriet Smith	""" Yes : but a young lady -- a bride -- I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible ."
Harriet Smith	""" But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _ bride _ ? It ought to be no recommendation to _ you _ ."
Harriet Smith	""" Well , papa , if this is not encouragement to marry , I do not know what is ."
Harriet Smith	It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying . The impertinence of the Eltons , which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening , had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of Harriet 's infatuation.-- From Harriet 's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she had strong hopes .
Harriet Smith	She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational , Frank Churchill not too much in love , and Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her , how very happy a summer must be before her !
Harriet Smith	Having arranged all these matters , looked them through , and put them all to rights , she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys , as well as of their grandpapa , when the great iron sweep - gate opened , and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together -- Frank Churchill , with Harriet leaning on his arm -- actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened .
Harriet Smith	Harriet looked white and frightened , and he was trying to cheer her.-- The iron gates and the front - door were not twenty yards asunder;-- they were all three soon in the hall , and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away .
Harriet Smith	Miss Smith , and Miss Bickerton , another parlour boarder at Mrs. Goddard 's , who had been also at the ball , had walked out together , and taken a road , the Richmond road , which , though apparently public enough for safety , had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond Highbury , making a sudden turn , and deeply shaded by elms on each side , it became for a considerable stretch very retired ; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it , they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them , on a broader patch of greensward by the side , a party of gipsies . A child on the watch , came towards them to beg ; and Miss Bickerton , excessively frightened , gave a great scream , and calling on Harriet to follow her , ran up a steep bank , cleared a slight hedge at the top , and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury . But poor Harriet could not follow .
Harriet Smith	How the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill.--She was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more . In this state Frank Churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , they loud and insolent . By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment . The pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward , and leave his horses to meet him by another road , a mile or two beyond Highbury-- and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates , and to have forgotten to restore them , he had been obliged to stop at her door , and go in for a few minutes : he was therefore later than he had intended ; and being on foot , was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them . The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion .
Harriet Smith	He had left them completely frightened ; and Harriet eagerly clinging to him , and hardly able to speak , had just strength enough to reach Hartfield , before her spirits were quite overcome .
Harriet Smith	It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield : he had thought of no other place .
Harriet Smith	This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and of Harriet 's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.-- He dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself .
Harriet Smith	Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--And knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more .
Harriet Smith	In the few minutes ' conversation which she had yet had with him , while Harriet had been partially insensible , he had spoken of her terror , her naivete , her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm , with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at last , after Harriet 's own account had been given , he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms .
Harriet Smith	Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again . It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ) , as well as Miss Smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent-- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and Harriet not much otherwise , Emma would not interfere with .
Harriet Smith	The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry . The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began , and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground , and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital .
Harriet Smith	""" I do not know what your opinion may be , Mrs. Weston , "" said Mr. Knightley , "" of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith , but I think it a bad thing ."
Harriet Smith	Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good . I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good !
Harriet Smith	""" "" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle . "" "" Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject . We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with . Mr. Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith . She is not the superior young woman which Emma 's friend ought to be . But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself ."
Harriet Smith	"She means it , I know . """
Harriet Smith	"She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding . Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate , I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not . "" """
Harriet Smith	I hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a Weston in merit , and a Churchill in fortune.--But Harriet Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith .
Harriet Smith	I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have .
Harriet Smith	She knows nothing herself , and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing .
Harriet Smith	She is a flatterer in all her ways ; and so much the worse , because undesigned .
Harriet Smith	Her ignorance is hourly flattery .
Harriet Smith	How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ?
Harriet Smith	And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _ she _ can not gain by the acquaintance .
Harriet Smith	Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to .
Harriet Smith	She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home .
Harriet Smith	Mrs. Weston , I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith , or my dread of its doing them both harm .
Harriet Smith	""" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma 's mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith 's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you ."
Harriet Smith	""" Does nothing occur to you?-- Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith . "" Her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what . """
Harriet Smith	"Have you heard from her yourself this morning ? """
Harriet Smith	Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin .
Harriet Smith	It seems an impossibility!--You can not mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin .
Harriet Smith	You can not mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet .
Harriet Smith	The party was to be our brother and sister , Henry , John -- and Miss Smith .
Harriet Smith	They called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as I understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain.--She
Harriet Smith	made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving .
Harriet Smith	Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.-- She will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman 's language can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only in the great.--However
Harriet Smith	, I must say , that Robert Martin 's heart seemed for _ him _ , and to _ me _ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at Astley 's , my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John , and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy .
Harriet Smith	I think Harriet is doing extremely well .
Harriet Smith	_ Her _ connexions may be worse than _ his _ .
Harriet Smith	how peculiarly unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before .
Harriet Smith	""" You ought to know your friend best , "" replied Mr. Knightley ; "" but I should say she was a good - tempered , soft - hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her ."
Harriet Smith	"Emma could not help laughing as she answered , "" Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But , Mr. Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _ accepted _ him . I could suppose she might in time -- but can she already?-- Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him?--It was not Harriet 's hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox . "" The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was , at this moment , so strong to Emma 's feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet 's side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , "" No , I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin , "" that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature ."
Harriet Smith	Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are ?
Harriet Smith	""" I am quite sure , "" he replied , speaking very distinctly , "" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so ."
Harriet Smith	He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends .
Harriet Smith	""" "" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before . "" "" I hope so -- for at that time I was a fool . "" "" And I am changed also ; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet 's good qualities ."
Harriet Smith	I have taken some pains for your sake , and for Robert Martin 's sake , ( whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever , ) to get acquainted with her .
Harriet Smith	I have often talked to her a good deal .
Harriet Smith	Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin 's cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.-- Much of this , I have no doubt , she may thank you for .
Harriet Smith	""" "" Me ! "" cried Emma , shaking her head.--""Ah ! poor Harriet ! "" She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved ."
Harriet Smith	The joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined . The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet 's welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.--What had she to wish for ?
Harriet Smith	""" Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens ."
Harriet Smith	He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton , and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma 's , and Harriet 's going there some very fine morning .
Harriet Smith	The invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like Mrs. Elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and Mr. Weston , unasked , promised to get Frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--
Harriet Smith	In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete - a - tete ; but she was glad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion , and turned from her with little ceremony .
Harriet Smith	Now they seemed in pleasant conversation . There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm ; but now she feared it not .
Harriet Smith	"He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture , etc . and Emma received a smile which seemed to say , "" These are my own concerns ."
Harriet Smith	It was too old a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet.--They took a few turns together along
Harriet Smith	Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration ; she behaved very well , and betrayed no emotion . The cold repast was over , and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen , the old Abbey fish - ponds ; perhaps get as far as the clover , which was to be begun cutting on the morrow , or , at any rate , have the pleasure of being hot , and growing cool again.--Mr
Harriet Smith	"Harriet 's sweet easy temper will not mind it . "" He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal , and came back all the better -- grown quite cool -- and , with good manners , like himself -- able to draw a chair close to them , take an interest in their employment ; and regret , in a reasonable way , that he should be so late ."
Harriet Smith	Emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill , was willing to forget his late improprieties , and be as well satisfied with him as before , and on his making Harriet his very first subject , was ready to listen with most friendly smiles .
Harriet Smith	"He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend-- her fair , lovely , amiable friend . "" Did she know?--had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably . "" And in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and Emma was quite in charity with him ."
Harriet Smith	But at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on Harriet's -- more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint . He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _ promise _ _ him _ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her . She was vexed . It did appear -- there was no concealing it -- exactly like the pretence of being in love with her , instead of Harriet ; an inconstancy , if real , the most contemptible and abominable !
Harriet Smith	"and she had difficulty in behaving with temper . He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance , "" Would not she give him her support?--would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard 's till it were certain that Miss Smith 's disorder had no infection ?"
Harriet Smith	"He could not be satisfied without a promise-- would not she give him her influence in procuring it ? """
Harriet Smith	""" So scrupulous for others , "" he continued , "" and yet so careless for herself !"
Harriet Smith	She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to - day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself .
Harriet Smith	"I am sure of your kind support and aid . "" Emma saw Mrs. Weston 's surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose ."
Harriet Smith	It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have
Harriet Smith	Without scruple -- without apology-- without much apparent diffidence , Mr. Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _ her _ lover . She tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all .
Harriet Smith	and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner .
Harriet Smith	As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings-- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared , ) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent .
Harriet Smith	"and she had difficulty in behaving with temper . He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance , "" Would not she give him her support?--would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard 's till it were certain that Miss Smith 's disorder had no infection ?"
Harriet Smith	"you forget yourself-- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _ me _ , if you please . """
Harriet Smith	""" Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly mean!""--"
Harriet Smith	He perfectly knew his own meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,-- but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,--he resumed the subject of his own passion , and was very urgent for a favourable answer .
Harriet Smith	After such behaviour , as I have witnessed during the last month , to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible !
Harriet Smith	Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend .
Harriet Smith	If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed!--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse ! who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near !
Harriet Smith	Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought seriously of her ?
Harriet Smith	I _ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl ; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled .
Harriet Smith	I wish her extremely well : and , no doubt , there are men who might not object to --
Harriet Smith	"I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!-- No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received-- "" "" Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it . I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend ."
Harriet Smith	I am exceedingly sorry : but it is well that the mistake ends where it does . Had the same behaviour continued , Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views ; not being aware , probably , any more than myself , of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of .
Harriet Smith	The Picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon after Mr. Elton 's return , and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting - room , he got up to look at it , and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as for Harriet 's feelings , they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted .
Harriet Smith	It was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet 's fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot - pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies .
Harriet Smith	Emma assisted with her invention , memory and taste ; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand , it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order , in form as well as quantity .
Harriet Smith	The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet , which Emma could understand .
Harriet Smith	There was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend 's .
Harriet Smith	"He was gone the next moment:--after another moment 's pause , "" Take it , "" said Emma , smiling , and pushing the paper towards Harriet--""it is for you . Take your own ."
Harriet Smith	But Harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and Emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself .
Harriet Smith	To Miss-- CHARADE .
Harriet Smith	"She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , "" Very well , Mr. Elton , very well indeed ."
Harriet Smith	Harriet exactly .
Harriet Smith	Soft is the very word for her eye -- of all epithets , the justest that could be given .
Harriet Smith	Humph -- Harriet 's ready wit !
Harriet Smith	A man must be very much in love , indeed , to describe her so .
Harriet Smith	She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations , which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length , by the eagerness of Harriet 's wondering questions .
Harriet Smith	I have not an idea -- I can not guess it in the least . What can it possibly be ?
Harriet Smith	Do help me .
Harriet Smith	I never saw any thing so hard .
Harriet Smith	I wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady .
Harriet Smith	My dear Harriet , what are you thinking of ?
Harriet Smith	Give me the paper and listen .
Harriet Smith	united , ( _ courtship _ , you know , ) what reverse we have !
Harriet Smith	A very proper compliment!--and then follows the application , which I think , my dear Harriet , you can not find much difficulty in comprehending .
Harriet Smith	Read it in comfort to yourself .
Harriet Smith	"There can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you . """
Harriet Smith	Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion .
Harriet Smith	She read the concluding lines , and was all flutter and happiness . She could not speak .
Harriet Smith	But she was not wanted to speak . It was enough for her to feel .
Harriet Smith	Emma spoke for her .
Harriet Smith	You are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it .
Harriet Smith	I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you .
Harriet Smith	Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened .
Harriet Smith	I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural .
Harriet Smith	I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart .
Harriet Smith	It will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to Hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever .
Harriet Smith	This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us .
Harriet Smith	""" "" Dear Miss Woodhouse!""--and "" Dear Miss Woodhouse , "" was all that Harriet , with many tender embraces could articulate at first ; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation , it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw , felt , anticipated , and remembered just as she ought ."
Harriet Smith	""" Whatever you say is always right , "" cried Harriet , "" and therefore I suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise I could not have imagined it ."
Harriet Smith	It is so much beyond any thing I deserve .
Harriet Smith	"Dear me , how clever!--Could it really be meant for me ? """
Harriet Smith	""" I can not make a question , or listen to a question about that ."
Harriet Smith	Receive it on my judgment .
Harriet Smith	""" "" It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected . I am sure , a month ago , I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do take place ! "" """
Harriet Smith	You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes .
Harriet Smith	Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls .
Harriet Smith	""" "" That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me , of all people , who did not know him , to speak to him , at Michaelmas !"
Harriet Smith	Dear me !
Harriet Smith	When I look back to the first time I saw him !
Harriet Smith	How little did I think!--The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good - natured .
Harriet Smith	""" "" This is an alliance which , whoever -- whatever your friends may be , must be agreeable to them , provided at least they have common sense ; and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools ."
Harriet Smith	If they are anxious to see you _ happily _ married , here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in , here it will be accomplished ; and if their only object is that you should , in the common phrase , be _ well _ married , here is the comfortable fortune , the respectable establishment , the rise in the world which must satisfy them .
Harriet Smith	How nicely you talk ; I love to hear you .
Harriet Smith	You understand every thing .
Harriet Smith	"You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other . This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth , I could never have made any thing like it . """
Harriet Smith	""" I thought he meant to try his skill , by his manner of declining it yesterday . "" "" I do think it is , without exception , the best charade I ever read . "" "" I never read one more to the purpose , certainly . "" "" It is as long again as almost all we have had before . "" "" I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour ."
Harriet Smith	"Such things in general can not be too short . "" Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear ."
Harriet Smith	The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind .
Harriet Smith	""" It is one thing , "" said she , presently -- her cheeks in a glow--""to have very good sense in a common way , like every body else , and if there is any thing to say , to sit down and write a letter , and say just what you must , in a short way ; and another , to write verses and charades like this . """
Harriet Smith	""" Such sweet lines ! "" continued Harriet--""these two last!--But how shall I ever be able to return the paper , or say I have found it out?--Oh !"
Harriet Smith	"Miss Woodhouse , what can we do about that ? "" "" Leave it to me ."
Harriet Smith	You do nothing .
Harriet Smith	He will be here this evening , I dare say , and then I will give it him back , and some nonsense or other will pass between us , and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming .
Harriet Smith	Trust to me .
Harriet Smith	Miss Woodhouse , what a pity that I must not write this beautiful
Harriet Smith	charade into my book
Harriet Smith	I am sure I have not got one half so good .
Harriet Smith	""" Leave out the two last lines , and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book ."
Harriet Smith	""" "" Oh ! but those two lines are""-- --""The best of all . Granted;--for private enjoyment ; and for private enjoyment keep them . They are not at all the less written you know , because you divide them ."
Harriet Smith	"Give me the book , I will write it down , and then there can be no possible reflection on you . "" Harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love . It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity . "" I shall never let that book go out of my own hands , "" said she . "" Very well , "" replied Emma ; "" a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better I shall be pleased ."
Harriet Smith	But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him .
Harriet Smith	He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him .
Harriet Smith	""" Harriet looked grave . """
Harriet Smith	My dear Harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade.--You will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it .
Harriet Smith	If he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while I was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you .
Harriet Smith	no -- I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it .
Harriet Smith	"Do as you please . "" Mr. Woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of "" Well , my dears , how does your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh ? "" "" Yes , papa ; we have something to read you , something quite fresh ."
Harriet Smith	It is such a pretty charade , my dear , that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written
Harriet Smith	Kitty , a fair but frozen maid , Kindled a flame I yet deplore , The hood - wink'd boy I called to aid , Though of his near approach afraid , So fatal to my suit before . And that is all that I can recollect of it -- but it is very clever all the way through . But I think , my dear , you said you had got it .
Harriet Smith	"It was Garrick 's , you know . "" "" Aye , very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it ."
Harriet Smith	""" "" I do not know , my dear -- but it is so long since she was here!--not since last Easter , and then only for a few days.--Mr . John Knightley 's being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly taken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here ! """
Harriet Smith	""" "" I do not know , my dear ."
Harriet Smith	I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas -- though you know it is longer since they were with him , than with us .
Harriet Smith	papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish , and I do not think you ever will .
Harriet Smith	""" Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here ."
Harriet Smith	I am sure she will be pleased with the children . We are very proud of the children , are not we , papa ?
Harriet Smith	I wonder which she will think the handsomest , Henry or John ?
Harriet Smith	""" "" Aye , I wonder which she will ."
Harriet Smith	They are very fond of being at Hartfield , Harriet .
Harriet Smith	""" "" I dare say they are , sir ."
Harriet Smith	"I am sure I do not know who is not . "" """
Harriet Smith	Henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father .
Harriet Smith	Some people are surprized , I believe , that the eldest was not , but Isabella would have him called Henry , which I thought very pretty of her .
Harriet Smith	They will come and stand by my chair , and say , ` Grandpapa , can you give me a bit of string ? ' and once Henry asked me for a knife , but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas .
Harriet Smith	"I think their father is too rough with them very often . "" "" He appears rough to you , "" said Emma , "" because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough . He wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father ."
Harriet Smith	"It is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other . "" "" Well , I can not understand it . "" "" That is the case with us all , papa ."
Harriet Smith	Harriet turned away ; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up .
Harriet Smith	here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it
Harriet Smith	"He looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused ; said something about "" honour,""--glanced at Emma and at Harriet , and then seeing the book open on the table , took it up , and examined it very attentively ."
Harriet Smith	Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh . She ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet 's share .
Harriet Smith	It was by no means his daughter 's wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked . He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips . They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles ; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled , and rather sentimentally recited , that well - known charade , My first doth affliction denote , Which my second is destin'd to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal.-- made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already .
Harriet Smith	""" Why will not you write one yourself for us , Mr. Elton ? "" said she ; "" that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you . "" "" Oh no !"
Harriet Smith	"He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse""--he stopt a moment--""or Miss Smith could inspire him . """
Harriet Smith	""" I do not offer it for Miss Smith 's collection , "" said he ."
Harriet Smith	""" Being my friend 's , I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye , but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it ."
Harriet Smith	There was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend 's .
Harriet Smith	"She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , "" Very well , Mr. Elton , very well indeed ."
Harriet Smith	I have read worse charades .
Harriet Smith	I give you credit for it .
Harriet Smith	This is saying very plainly--`Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Knightley , I wish you had the benefit of this ; I think this would convince you .
Harriet Smith	She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations , which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length , by the eagerness of Harriet 's wondering questions .
Harriet Smith	I wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady .
Harriet Smith	Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark ?
Harriet Smith	For Miss ---------- , read Miss Smith .
Harriet Smith	When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted -- they do indeed -- and really it is strange ; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently , so palpably desirable -- what courts the pre - arrangement of other people , should so immediately shape itself into the proper form .
Harriet Smith	How nicely you talk ; I love to hear you .
Harriet Smith	She read it to him , just as he liked to have any thing read , slowly and distinctly , and two or three times over , with explanations of every part as she proceeded -- and he was very much pleased , and , as she had foreseen , especially struck with the complimentary conclusion .
Harriet Smith	We admired it so much , that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith 's collection .
Harriet Smith	Your friend will not take it amiss I hope .
Harriet Smith	V Small heart had Harriet for visiting .
Harriet Smith	Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard 's , her evil stars had led her to the very spot where , at that moment , a trunk , directed to _ The _ _ Rev. _ _ Philip _ _ Elton _ , _ White - Hart _ , _ Bath _ , was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher 's cart , which was to convey it to where the coaches past ; and every thing in this world , excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently a blank .
Harriet Smith	She went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple - trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted ,
Harriet Smith	Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour . She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell .
Harriet Smith	The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again ; and Miss Smith receiving her summons , was with her without delay , and unattended by any alarming young man .
Harriet Smith	She came solitarily down the gravel walk -- a Miss Martin just appearing at the door , and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility .
Harriet Smith	Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account .
Harriet Smith	She was feeling too much ; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting , and the sort of pain it was creating .
Harriet Smith	She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls .
Harriet Smith	They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time-- till just at last , when Mrs. Martin 's saying , all of a sudden , that she thought Miss Smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner . In that very room she had been measured last September , with her two friends . There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window . _ He _ had done it .
Harriet Smith	They all seemed to remember the day , the hour , the party , the occasion -- to feel the same consciousness , the same regrets -- to be ready to return to the same good understanding ; and they were just growing again like themselves , ( Harriet , as Emma must suspect , as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy , ) when the carriage reappeared , and all was over . The style of the visit , and the shortness of it , were then felt to be decisive .
Harriet Smith	Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture it all , and feel how justly they might resent , how naturally Harriet must suffer .
Harriet Smith	She would have given a great deal , or endured a great deal , to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life . They were so deserving , that a _ little _ higher should have been enough : but as it was , how could she have done otherwise?--Impossible!--She
Harriet Smith	They must be separated ; but there was a great deal of pain in the process-- so much to herself at this time , that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation , and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it .
Harriet Smith	Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins .
Harriet Smith	Emma 's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness ; every thing wore a different air ; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before . When she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to Harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there .
Harriet Smith	The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again ; and Miss Smith receiving her summons , was with her without delay , and unattended by any alarming young man .
Harriet Smith	They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time-- till just at last , when Mrs. Martin 's saying , all of a sudden , that she thought Miss Smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner . In that very room she had been measured last September , with her two friends . There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window . _ He _ had done it .
Harriet Smith	True , true , you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax ; I remember you knew her at Weymouth , and a fine girl she is .
Harriet Smith	Call upon her , by all means .
Harriet Smith	What is right to be done can not be done too soon . And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her _ here _ should be carefully avoided .
Harriet Smith	You saw her with the Campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on .
Harriet Smith	""" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance , "" said Emma ; "" she is a very elegant young woman . "" He agreed to it , but with so quiet a "" Yes , "" as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it ."
Harriet Smith	""" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before , "" said she , "" I think you will to - day ."
Harriet Smith	You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue .
Harriet Smith	""" "" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ? "" said Mr. Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; "" then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady ."
Harriet Smith	She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life . They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way .
Harriet Smith	"I Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in Emma 's opinion , had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day . She could not think that Harriet 's solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive-- "" Mr. Elton is so good to the poor ! "" she found something else must be done ."
Harriet Smith	But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in -- observing , as she proposed it to Harriet , that , as well as she could calculate , they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax .
Harriet Smith	Emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ' ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent Harriet 's being obliged to say a word . This she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury , and their card - parties .
Harriet Smith	""" "" I am afraid we must be running away , "" said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise--""My father will be expecting us ."
Harriet Smith	A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins 's name was first mentioned in Highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her Christian name , and say whose music she principally played .
Harriet Smith	The charming Augusta Hawkins , in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands as would always be called ten ; a point of some dignity , as well as some convenience : the story told well ; he had not thrown himself away -- he had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity-- the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice ; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps so quick , from the accidental rencontre , to the dinner at Mr. Green 's , and the party at Mrs. Brown's -- smiles and blushes rising in importance-- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- had in short , to use a most intelligible phrase , been so very ready to have him , that vanity and prudence were equally contented .
Harriet Smith	Of the lady , individually , Emma thought very little . She was good enough for Mr. Elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for Highbury-- handsome enough -- to look plain , probably , by Harriet 's side .
Harriet Smith	As to connexion , there Emma was perfectly easy ; persuaded , that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet , he had done nothing .
Harriet Smith	On that article , truth seemed attainable . _ What _ she was , must be uncertain ; but _ who _ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the 10,000 l. , it did not appear that she was
Harriet Smith	at all Harriet 's superior .
Harriet Smith	She brought no name , no blood , no alliance .
Harriet Smith	Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol-- merchant , of course , he must be called ; but , as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also . Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath ; but Bristol was her home , the very heart of Bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained-- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived .
Harriet Smith	That was the wind - up of the history ; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins .
Harriet Smith	Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all !
Harriet Smith	She had talked her into love ; but , alas !
Harriet Smith	she was not so easily to be talked out of it . The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet 's mind was not to be talked away . He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her . Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love .
Harriet Smith	And now , poor girl !
Harriet Smith	she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton .
Harriet Smith	She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other .
Harriet Smith	Emma saw him only once ; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure _ just _ to meet with him , or _ just _ to miss him , _ just _ to hear his voice , or see his shoulder , _ just _ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture .
Harriet Smith	She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her . Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins 's happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached!-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love ! Had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of Harriet 's mind , Emma would have been amused by its variations . Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated , sometimes the Martins ; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other .
Harriet Smith	The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin 's calling at Mrs. Goddard 's a few days afterwards .
Harriet Smith	Harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess .
Harriet Smith	While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin 's visit .
Harriet Smith	It must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!-- After much thinking , she could determine on nothing better , than Harriet 's returning the visit ; but in a way that , if they had understanding , should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance .
Harriet Smith	She meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the Abbey Mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future .
Harriet Smith	She could think of nothing better : and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve -- something of ingratitude , merely glossed over -- it must be done , or what would become of Harriet ?
Harriet Smith	"I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you . "" Mr. Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr. Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat . He began speaking of Harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before ."
Harriet Smith	""" I can not rate her beauty as you do , "" said he ; "" but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition . Her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman ."
Harriet Smith	""" "" I am glad you think so ; and the good hands , I hope , may not be wanting . "" "" Come , "" said he , "" you are anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you that you have improved her ."
Harriet Smith	"You have cured her of her school - girl 's giggle ; she really does you credit . "" "" Thank you ."
Harriet Smith	""" You are expecting her again , you say , this morning ? "" "" Almost every moment ."
Harriet Smith	"She has been gone longer already than she intended . "" "" Something has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps . """
Harriet Smith	""" Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would . """
Harriet Smith	"He presently added , with a smile , "" I do not pretend to fix on times or places , but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage . "" "" Indeed !"
Harriet Smith	I can think of but one thing -- Who is in love with her ?
Harriet Smith	""" I have reason to think , "" he replied , "" that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert Martin is the man ."
Harriet Smith	Her visit to Abbey - Mill , this summer , seems to have done his business .
Harriet Smith	He is desperately in love and means to marry her .
Harriet Smith	""" He is very obliging , "" said Emma ; "" but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him ?"
Harriet Smith	""" "" Well , well , means to make her an offer then ."
Harriet Smith	He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , I believe , considers me as one of his best friends . He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether I thought her too young : in short , whether I approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _ your _ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him .
Harriet Smith	I praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy .
Harriet Smith	Now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard 's to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch .
Harriet Smith	""" Certainly , "" replied he , surprized , "" I do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred . Was not she the whole day with you ? "" "" Come , "" said she , "" I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me . He did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused ."
Harriet Smith	"This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said , "" Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her . What is the foolish girl about ? """
Harriet Smith	Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin ?
Harriet Smith	""" I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer . "" "" You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too ."
Harriet Smith	You persuaded her to refuse him .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man , but I can not admit him to be Harriet 's equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her . By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples .
Harriet Smith	""" "" Not Harriet 's equal ! "" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , "" No , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation ."
Harriet Smith	Emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you .
Harriet Smith	What are Harriet Smith 's claims , either of birth , nature or education , to any connexion higher than Robert Martin ?
Harriet Smith	She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations .
Harriet Smith	She is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school .
Harriet Smith	She is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information .
Harriet Smith	She has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself .
Harriet Smith	At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her .
Harriet Smith	She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all . My only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him . I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse . But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well .
Harriet Smith	The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have I now ) that there would be a general cry - out upon her extreme good luck .
Harriet Smith	"Even _ your _ satisfaction I made sure of . It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend 's leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well . I remember saying to myself , ` Even Emma , with all her partiality for Harriet , will think this a good match . ' "" "" I can not help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing ."
Harriet Smith	What ! think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more , ) a good match for my intimate friend !
Harriet Smith	Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own !
Harriet Smith	You are not just to Harriet 's claims .
Harriet Smith	"They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves is much above his.--It would be a degradation . "" "" A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer ! "" "" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense . She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely"
Harriet Smith	be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman 's daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen 's daughters , no one , I apprehend ,
Harriet Smith	will deny.--She
Harriet Smith	""" "" Whoever might be her parents , "" said Mr. Knightley , "" whoever may have had the charge of her , it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society ."
Harriet Smith	After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard 's hands to shift as she can;--to move , in short , in Mrs. Goddard 's line , to have Mrs. Goddard 's acquaintance .
Harriet Smith	Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _ was _ good enough .
Harriet Smith	She desired nothing better herself .
Harriet Smith	Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it . She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer .
Harriet Smith	She had no sense of superiority then .
Harriet Smith	If she has it now , you have given it .
Harriet Smith	You have been no friend to Harriet Smith , Emma .
Harriet Smith	Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him .
Harriet Smith	You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet .
Harriet Smith	Harriet 's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice . Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess .
Harriet Smith	I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment .
Harriet Smith	Harriet may pick and chuse .
Harriet Smith	Were you , yourself , ever to marry , she is the very woman for you .
Harriet Smith	And is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ?
Harriet Smith	No -- pray let her have time to look about her .
Harriet Smith	""" "" I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy , "" said Mr. Knightley presently , "" though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet ."
Harriet Smith	You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her .
Harriet Smith	Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl .
Harriet Smith	Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed . Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour - boarder at Mrs. Goddard 's all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other , ) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master 's son .
Harriet Smith	But as to my _ letting _ her marry Robert Martin , it is impossible ; she has refused him , and so decidedly , I think , as must prevent any second application .
Harriet Smith	She must abide by the evil of having refused him , whatever it may be ; and as to the refusal itself , I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little ; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do .
Harriet Smith	His appearance is so much against him , and his manner so bad , that if she ever were disposed to favour him , she is not now .
Harriet Smith	I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him . He was the brother of her friends , and he took pains to please her ; and altogether , having seen nobody better ( that must have been his great assistant ) she might not , while she was at Abbey - Mill , find him disagreeable .
Harriet Smith	She knows now what gentlemen are ; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet .
Harriet Smith	""" "" Nonsense , errant nonsense , as ever was talked ! "" cried Mr. Knightley.--""Robert Martin 's manners have sense , sincerity , and good - humour to recommend them ; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand ."
Harriet Smith	"Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain . "" Emma laughed and disclaimed ."
Harriet Smith	He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet 's .
Harriet Smith	""" If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton 's marrying Harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself ."
Harriet Smith	He felt the disappointment of the young man , and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it , by the sanction he had given ; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair , was provoking him exceedingly .
Harriet Smith	She was not so materially cast down , however , but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives .
Harriet Smith	Harriet 's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy . The possibility of the young man 's coming to Mrs. Goddard 's that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas . The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness
Harriet Smith	when Harriet appeared , and in very good spirits , and without having any such reason to give for her long absence , she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind , and convinced her , that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would ,
Harriet Smith	she
Harriet Smith	had done nothing which woman 's friendship and woman 's feelings would not justify .
Harriet Smith	He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton ; but when she considered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of Mr. Knightley 's pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about .
Harriet Smith	He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives .
Harriet Smith	Harriet 's cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of Mr. Martin , but to talk of Mr. Elton . Miss Nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight .
Harriet Smith	The misfortune of Harriet 's cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella 's coming , and of Emma 's being to follow ,
Harriet Smith	Emma 's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion .
Harriet Smith	"Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of "" Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!""-- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs. Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners ."
Harriet Smith	For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet 's , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton 's nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to .
Harriet Smith	I should like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend , Miss Smith , and my son -- and then I should say we were quite complete . I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting Frank .
Harriet Smith	Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete .
Harriet Smith	Emma and Harriet went together ; Miss Bates and her niece , with the Eltons ; the gentlemen on horseback .
Harriet Smith	The Eltons walked together ; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill .
Harriet Smith	While he was so dull , it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable .
Harriet Smith	There are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet , ) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing .
Harriet Smith	"Harriet.--It did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally ; some looked very stupid about it , and Mr. Knightley gravely said , "" This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else . _ Perfection _ should not have come quite so soon ."
Harriet Smith	"You shall have a charming wife . "" "" She must be very lively , and have hazle eyes ."
Harriet Smith	I shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when I return , I shall come to you for my wife .
Harriet Smith	Would not Harriet be the very creature described ?
Harriet Smith	Hazle eyes excepted , two years more might make her all that he wished . He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ? Referring the education to her seemed to imply it .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Weston , his son , Emma , and Harriet , only remained ; and the young man 's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant .
Harriet Smith	There was only Harriet , who seemed not in spirits herself , fagged , and very willing to be silent ; and Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home , without being at any trouble to check them , extraordinary as they were .
Harriet Smith	If Emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr. Knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty . A very few days brought the party from London , and she had no
Harriet Smith	an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet
Harriet Smith	Harriet was a little distressed -- did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend 's approbation , Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--
Harriet Smith	Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley 's , and the dinner the next day ; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight .
Harriet Smith	But what did such particulars explain?-- The fact was , as Emma could now acknowledge , that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin ; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this , it must ever be unintelligible to Emma . The event , however , was most joyful ; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet 's
Harriet Smith	She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!-- It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr. Elton!-- The stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed .
Harriet Smith	No objection was raised on the father 's side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin , who was now introduced at Hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend . She had no doubt of Harriet 's happiness with any good - tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement . She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness . She would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out . She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;--or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself .
Harriet Smith	Harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins , was less and less at Hartfield ; which was not to be regretted.-- The intimacy between her and Emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner .
Harriet Smith	Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them ,
Harriet Smith	Nay , he appeared so much otherwise , that his daughter 's courage failed . She could not bear to see him suffering , to know him fancying himself neglected ; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys , that when once the event were over , his distress would be soon over too , she hesitated -- she could not proceed .
Harriet Smith	The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day -- and Mr. Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse .
Harriet Smith	"The wedding was very much like other weddings , where the parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and Mrs. Elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband , thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior to her own.--""Very little white satin , very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard of it . ""--But , in spite of these deficiencies , the wishes , the hopes , the confidence , the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony , were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union . FINIS"
Harriet Smith	She had ventured once alone to Randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a Harriet Smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges .
Harriet Smith	But in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs .
Harriet Smith	Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to . Her
Harriet Smith	attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected .
Harriet Smith	Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith 's being exactly the young friend she wanted -- exactly the something which her home required .
Harriet Smith	Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem . Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful .
Harriet Smith	For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done ; for Harriet every thing .
Harriet Smith	Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but Harriet could not tell .
Harriet Smith	She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain .
Harriet Smith	Harriet had no penetration .
Harriet Smith	She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her ; and looked no farther .
Harriet Smith	Mrs. Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation -- and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey - Mill Farm , it must have been the whole .
Harriet Smith	But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place .
Harriet Smith	She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son 's wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs. Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever . With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .
Harriet Smith	Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games ; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good - humoured and obliging .
Harriet Smith	He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts , because she had said how fond she was of them , and in every thing else he was so very obliging .
Harriet Smith	He had his shepherd 's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her .
Harriet Smith	She was very fond of singing .
Harriet Smith	He could sing a little himself . She believed he was very clever , and understood every thing .
Harriet Smith	He had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them , he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country . She believed every body spoke well of him .
Harriet Smith	""" You know what you are about . "" "" And when she had come away , Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen . Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday , and asked all the three teachers , Miss Nash , and Miss Prince , and Miss Richardson , to sup with her . "" """
Harriet Smith	""" Oh yes!--that is , no -- I do not know -- but I believe he has read a good deal -- but not what you would think any thing of ."
Harriet Smith	And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield .
Harriet Smith	He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them , but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can .
Harriet Smith	I thought him very plain at first , but I do not think him so plain now .
Harriet Smith	""" "" That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name ."
Harriet Smith	A young farmer , whether on horseback or on foot , is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity .
Harriet Smith	The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do .
Harriet Smith	A degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other .
Harriet Smith	But a farmer can need none of my help , and is , therefore , in one sense , as much above my notice as in every other he is below it .
Harriet Smith	""" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man . I know , indeed , that he is so , and , as such , wish him well ."
Harriet Smith	""" "" He was four - and - twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day 's difference -- which is very odd . "" "" Only four - and - twenty ."
Harriet Smith	"Dear Miss Woodhouse , he would be thirty years old ! """
Harriet Smith	Mr. Martin , I imagine , has his fortune entirely to make -- cannot be at all beforehand with the world . Whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , I dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet .
Harriet Smith	""" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry;--I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice ."
Harriet Smith	The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates .
Harriet Smith	There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman 's daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you .
Harriet Smith	""" "" Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are ."
Harriet Smith	But while I visit at Hartfield , and you are so kind to me , Miss Woodhouse , I am not afraid of what any body can do .
Harriet Smith	""" "" You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse ."
Harriet Smith	"I want to see you permanently well connected , and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries , I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters , to be acquainted with the wife , who will probably be some mere farmer 's daughter , without education . "" "" To be sure ."
Harriet Smith	Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up .
Harriet Smith	However , I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's -- and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife .
Harriet Smith	"I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins , especially Elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me . But if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly I had better not visit her , if I can help it . "" Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love ."
Harriet Smith	The young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on Harriet 's side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own . They met Mr. Martin the very next day , as they were walking on the Donwell road .
Harriet Smith	He was on foot , and after looking very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion .
Harriet Smith	His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet 's inclination .
Harriet Smith	Harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father 's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was . They remained but a few minutes together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which Miss Woodhouse
Harriet Smith	Well , Miss Woodhouse , is he like what you expected ?
Harriet Smith	What do you think of him ?
Harriet Smith	Do you think him so very plain ?
Harriet Smith	I had no right to expect much , and I did not expect much ; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish , so totally without air .
Harriet Smith	"I had imagined him , I confess , a degree or two nearer gentility . "" "" To be sure , "" said Harriet , in a mortified voice , "" he is not so genteel as real gentlemen . "" """
Harriet Smith	I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin .
Harriet Smith	At Hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men .
Harriet Smith	I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before .
Harriet Smith	Do not you begin to feel that now ?
Harriet Smith	Were not you struck ?
Harriet Smith	"I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here . "" "" Certainly , he is not like Mr. Knightley ."
Harriet Smith	He has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley . I see the difference plain enough .
Harriet Smith	But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to . What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton ?
Harriet Smith	You must see the difference .
Harriet Smith	The older a person grows , Harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes .
Harriet Smith	""" "" There is no saying , indeed , "" replied Harriet rather solemnly ."
Harriet Smith	And I have no doubt that he _ will _ thrive , and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _ us _ .
Harriet Smith	""" "" I wonder he did not remember the book""--was all Harriet 's answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself . She , therefore , said no more for some time ."
Harriet Smith	"Her next beginning was , "" In one respect , perhaps , Mr. Elton 's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley 's or Mr. Weston 's ."
Harriet Smith	Neither would Mr. Knightley 's downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _ him _ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable . On the contrary , I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model .
Harriet Smith	He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late .
Harriet Smith	I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , Harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be . If he means any thing , it must be to please you .
Harriet Smith	"Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day ? """
Harriet Smith	She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr. Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet 's head . She thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it . She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict .
Harriet Smith	It was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet 's coming to Hartfield . The longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Elton 's situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet .
Harriet Smith	He had a comfortable home for her , and Emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world .
Harriet Smith	She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet 's there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy .
Harriet Smith	He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin 's riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton 's admiration .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man 's company . She was to convey Harriet , and they drove to the Crown in good time , the Randalls party just sufficiently before them .
Harriet Smith	Of very important , very recordable events , it was not more productive than such meetings usually are . There was one , however , which Emma thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun , and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma 's wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about .
Harriet Smith	He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room .
Harriet Smith	In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again .
Harriet Smith	His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced .
Harriet Smith	It was not thrown away on her , she bounded higher than ever , flew farther down the middle , and was in a continual course of smiles .
Harriet Smith	"Mr. Elton had retreated into the card - room , looking ( Emma trusted ) very foolish . She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her;--_she _ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner , "" Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very"
Harriet Smith	"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet , "" said he ."
Harriet Smith	"He looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added , "" _ She _ ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be.--To that surmise"
Harriet Smith	""""
Harriet Smith	"It was through a series of strange blunders ! "" "" And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs. Elton is totally without ."
Harriet Smith	I found Harriet more conversable than I expected .
Harriet Smith	He came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it . He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith , or speaking to those who were close to her.--
Harriet Smith	""" Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- Miss Smith . """
Harriet Smith	""" Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You"
Harriet Smith	"It was through a series of strange blunders ! "" "" And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs. Elton is totally without ."
Harriet Smith	XVII Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield . The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and Mr. Woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella;--which poor Isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness .
Harriet Smith	"The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with Mr. Elton 's best compliments , "" that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense-- and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them . "" Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr . Elton 's absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired ."
Harriet Smith	She admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced .
Harriet Smith	have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father ,
Harriet Smith	from which she was so pointedly excluded .
Harriet Smith	She had not even a share in his opening compliments.--Her name was not mentioned;-- and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father 's suspicion .
Harriet Smith	It did , however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms , and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude .
Harriet Smith	She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark .
Harriet Smith	She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman 's return . She went to Mrs. Goddard 's accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was.-- She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred-- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks . The confession completely renewed her first shame -- and the sight of Harriet 's tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again .
Harriet Smith	Harriet bore the intelligence very well -- blaming nobody-- and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend .
Harriet Smith	Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet 's side , not her own .
Harriet Smith	Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of .
Harriet Smith	The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.-- She never could have deserved him -- and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible .
Harriet Smith	Her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma 's eyes-- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do . It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life . Her second duty now , inferior only to her father 's claims , was to promote Harriet 's comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making .
Harriet Smith	She got her to Hartfield , and shewed her the most unvarying kindness , striving to occupy and amuse her , and by books and conversation , to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts .
Harriet Smith	Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet 's age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton 's return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them . Harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness -- and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _ unrequited _ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force .
Harriet Smith	If Mr. Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet 's persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him . Their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three .
Harriet Smith	Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs. Goddard 's ; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth .
Harriet Smith	Where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and Emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself .
Harriet Smith	"IV A very few days had passed after this adventure , when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began : "" Miss Woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- I have something that I should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over ."
Harriet Smith	Emma was a good deal surprized ; but begged her to speak .
Harriet Smith	"There was a seriousness in Harriet 's manner which prepared her , quite as much as her words , for something more than ordinary . """
Harriet Smith	"It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish , "" she continued , "" to have no reserves with you on this subject ."
Harriet Smith	As I am happily quite an altered creature in _ one _ _ respect _ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it .
Harriet Smith	I do not want to say more than is necessary -- I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me .
Harriet Smith	""" Yes , "" said Emma , "" I hope I do . "" "" How I could so long a time be fancying myself ! . . . "" cried Harriet , warmly ."
Harriet Smith	I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet him or not -- except that of the two I had rather not see him-- and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him -- but I do not envy his wife in the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her , as I have done : she is very charming , I dare say , and all that , but I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable -- I shall never forget her look
Harriet Smith	, I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil.--No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment 's pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy --
Harriet Smith	"what I ought to have destroyed long ago -- what I ought never to have kept-- I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke).--However , now I will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown . Can not you guess what this parcel holds ? "" said she , with a conscious look ."
Harriet Smith	""" Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing ?"
Harriet Smith	""" No -- I can not call them gifts ; but they are things that I have valued very much ."
Harriet Smith	She held the parcel towards her , and Emma read the words _ Most _ _ precious _ _ treasures _ on the top .
Harriet Smith	Harriet unfolded the parcel , and she looked on with impatience .
Harriet Smith	Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge - ware box , which Harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , Emma saw only a small piece of court - plaister .
Harriet Smith	""" Now , "" said Harriet , "" you _ must _ recollect . """
Harriet Smith	""" No , indeed I do not . """
Harriet Smith	""" Dear me ! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat -- just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came-- I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister?-- But , as you had none about you , and knew I had , you desired me to supply him ; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me ."
Harriet Smith	And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it-- so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat .
Harriet Smith	""" My dearest Harriet ! "" cried Emma , putting her hand before her face , and jumping up , "" you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear ."
Harriet Smith	Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic -- I knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me!--Oh !
Harriet Smith	""" And had you really some at hand yourself ? I am sure I never suspected it , you did it so naturally ."
Harriet Smith	""" And so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake ! "" said Emma , recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement ."
Harriet Smith	"I never was equal to this . "" "" Here , "" resumed Harriet , turning to her box again , "" here is something still more valuable , I mean that _ has _ _ been _ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did . """
Harriet Smith	""" This was really his , "" said Harriet.--""Do not you remember one morning?--no , I dare say you do not ."
Harriet Smith	But one morning -- I forget exactly the day -- but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _ that _ _ evening _ , he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket - book ; it was about spruce - beer .
Harriet Smith	"But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment . "" "" I do remember it , "" cried Emma ; "" I perfectly remember it.-- Talking about spruce - beer.--Oh ! yes -- Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr. Elton 's seeming resolved to learn to like it too ."
Harriet Smith	"I have nothing more to shew you , or to say-- except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and I wish you to see me do it . "" "" My poor dear Harriet !"
Harriet Smith	"and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ? """
Harriet Smith	""" Yes , simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now , and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them . It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married ."
Harriet Smith	"I knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them . "" "" But , Harriet , is it necessary to burn the court - plaister?--I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court - plaister might be useful ."
Harriet Smith	""" I shall be happier to burn it , "" replied Harriet ."
Harriet Smith	""" It has a disagreeable look to me ."
Harriet Smith	"I must get rid of every thing.-- There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven ! of Mr. Elton . "" "" And when , "" thought Emma , "" will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill ? "" She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made , and could not but hope that the gipsy , though she had _ told _ no fortune , might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight after the alarm , they came to a sufficient explanation , and quite undesignedly ."
Harriet Smith	"She merely said , in the course of some trivial chat , "" Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so""--and thought no more of it , till after a minute 's silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone , "" I shall never marry . """
Harriet Smith	""" It is one that I shall never change , however . """
Harriet Smith	"After another short hesitation , "" I hope it does not proceed from-- I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton ? """
Harriet Smith	""" Mr. Elton indeed ! "" cried Harriet indignantly.--""Oh ! no""--and Emma could just catch the words , "" so superior to Mr. Elton ! """
Harriet Smith	Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances
Harriet Smith	"She had previously determined how far she would proceed , on any application of the sort ; and it would be safer for both , to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.-- She was decided , and thus spoke-- "" Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning ."
Harriet Smith	Your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you . Is not it so ?
Harriet Smith	Miss Woodhouse , believe me I have not the presumption to suppose-- Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance -- and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world , with the gratitude , wonder , and veneration , which are so proper , in me especially .
Harriet Smith	""" I am not at all surprized at you , Harriet ."
Harriet Smith	"The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart . "" "" Service !"
Harriet Smith	it was such an inexpressible obligation!-- The very recollection of it , and all that I felt at the time-- when I saw him coming -- his noble look -- and my wretchedness before .
Harriet Smith	It is natural , and it is honourable.-- Yes , honourable , I think , to chuse so well and so gratefully.-- But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise .
Harriet Smith	I do not advise you to give way to it , Harriet .
Harriet Smith	I do not by any means engage for its being returned .
Harriet Smith	Consider what you are about .
Harriet Smith	Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you . Be observant of him .
Harriet Smith	Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations .
Harriet Smith	I give you this caution now , because I shall never speak to you again on the subject .
Harriet Smith	I am determined against all interference .
Harriet Smith	Henceforward I know nothing of the matter .
Harriet Smith	Let no name ever pass our lips . We were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now.--He is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , Harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity .
Harriet Smith	But take care of yourself .
Harriet Smith	"I would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _ him _ , is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value . "" Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude ."
Harriet Smith	Harriet had been at Hartfield , as usual , soon after breakfast ; and , after a time , had gone home to return again to dinner : she returned , and sooner than had been talked of , and with an agitated , hurried look , announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell .
Harriet Smith	"She had heard , as soon as she got back to Mrs. Goddard 's , that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from Mr. Martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage . "" Who could have thought it ?"
Harriet Smith	She was so surprized she did not know what to do .
Harriet Smith	Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so .
Harriet Smith	"And he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.-- """
Harriet Smith	"He will connect himself well if he can . "" "" Will you read the letter ? "" cried Harriet ."
Harriet Smith	""" Pray do . I 'd rather you would . "" Emma was not sorry to be pressed ."
Harriet Smith	"She paused over it , while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a "" Well , well , "" and was at last forced to add , "" Is it a good letter ? or is it too short ? "" "" Yes , indeed , a very good letter , "" replied Emma rather slowly--""so good a letter , Harriet , that every thing considered , I think one of his sisters must have helped him ."
Harriet Smith	I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman .
Harriet Smith	A better written letter , Harriet ( returning it , ) than I had expected .
Harriet Smith	""" "" Well , "" said the still waiting Harriet;--""well -- and -- and what shall I do ? """
Harriet Smith	""" What shall you do !"
Harriet Smith	"Do you mean with regard to this letter ? "" "" Yes . "" "" But what are you in doubt of ?"
Harriet Smith	"You must answer it of course -- and speedily . "" "" Yes ."
Harriet Smith	But what shall I say ?
Harriet Smith	Dear Miss Woodhouse , do advise me .
Harriet Smith	the letter had much better be all your own .
Harriet Smith	You will express yourself very properly , I am sure .
Harriet Smith	There is no danger of your not being intelligible , which is the first thing .
Harriet Smith	Your meaning must be unequivocal ; no doubts or demurs :
Harriet Smith	and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires , will present themselves unbidden to _ your _ mind , I am persuaded .
Harriet Smith	You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment .
Harriet Smith	""" "" You think I ought to refuse him then , "" said Harriet , looking down ."
Harriet Smith	My dear Harriet , what do you mean ?
Harriet Smith	Are you in any doubt as to that ?
Harriet Smith	I thought -- but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have been under a mistake .
Harriet Smith	I certainly have been misunderstanding you , if you feel in doubt as to the _ purport _ of your answer .
Harriet Smith	"I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it . "" Harriet was silent . With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued : "" You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect ."
Harriet Smith	""" No , I do not ; that is , I do not mean -- What shall I do ?"
Harriet Smith	What would you advise me to do ?
Harriet Smith	Pray , dear Miss Woodhouse , tell me what I ought to do .
Harriet Smith	""" I shall not give you any advice , Harriet ."
Harriet Smith	I will have nothing to do with it .
Harriet Smith	This is a point which you must settle with your feelings .
Harriet Smith	""" "" I had no notion that he liked me so very much , "" said Harriet , contemplating the letter ."
Harriet Smith	"For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say , "" I lay it down as a general rule , Harriet , that if a woman _ doubts _ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him . If she can hesitate as to ` Yes , ' she ought to say ` No ' directly . It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings , with half a heart . I thought it my duty as a friend , and older than yourself , to say thus much to you . But do not imagine that I want to influence you . "" "" Oh !"
Harriet Smith	, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me what I had best do -- No , no , I do not mean that --
Harriet Smith	"It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say ` No , ' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say ` No ? ' """
Harriet Smith	""" Not for the world , "" said Emma , smiling graciously , "" would I advise you either way . You must be the best judge of your own happiness ."
Harriet Smith	If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ?
Harriet Smith	You blush , Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition ?
Harriet Smith	Harriet , Harriet , do not deceive yourself ; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion .
Harriet Smith	At this moment whom are you thinking of ?
Harriet Smith	, Harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard .
Harriet Smith	"Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes . At last , with some hesitation , Harriet said-- "" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr. Martin ."
Harriet Smith	"Do you think I am right ? """
Harriet Smith	""" Perfectly , perfectly right , my dearest Harriet ; you are doing just what you ought ."
Harriet Smith	While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving .
Harriet Smith	Dear Harriet , I give myself joy of this .
Harriet Smith	It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin .
Harriet Smith	While you were in the smallest degree wavering , I said nothing about it , because I would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me .
Harriet Smith	I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin , of Abbey - Mill Farm .
Harriet Smith	"Now I am secure of you for ever . "" Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly . "" You could not have visited me ! "" she cried , looking aghast ."
Harriet Smith	""" No , to be sure you could not ; but I never thought of that before . That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world . "" "" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been ."
Harriet Smith	You would have thrown yourself out of all good society .
Harriet Smith	I must have given you up .
Harriet Smith	""" Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it !"
Harriet Smith	"It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more ! """
Harriet Smith	""" Dear affectionate creature!--_You _ banished to Abbey - Mill Farm!--_You _ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life !"
Harriet Smith	I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it .
Harriet Smith	""" "" I do not think he is conceited either , in general , "" said Harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; "" at least , he is very good natured , and I shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that I should -- and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _ one _ is so very handsome and agreeable ."
Harriet Smith	However , I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but
Harriet Smith	"as to leaving you , it is what I would not do upon any consideration . "" "" Thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend ."
Harriet Smith	""" Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too . "" Emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a "" very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter ."
Harriet Smith	I am quite determined to refuse him .
Harriet Smith	But how shall I do ?
Harriet Smith	"What shall I say ? """
Harriet Smith	The business was finished , and Harriet safe .
Harriet Smith	She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton .
Harriet Smith	""" I shall never be invited to Abbey - Mill again , "" was said in rather a sorrowful tone . """
Harriet Smith	Nor , if you were , could I ever bear to part with you , my Harriet .
Harriet Smith	"You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey - Mill . """
Harriet Smith	""" And I am sure I should never want to go there ; for I am never happy but at Hartfield . """
Harriet Smith	"Some time afterwards it was , "" I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened ."
Harriet Smith	"I am sure Miss Nash would -- for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen - draper . """
Harriet Smith	""" One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , Harriet ."
Harriet Smith	I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married .
Harriet Smith	As to any thing superior for you , I suppose she is quite in the dark .
Harriet Smith	Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves .
Harriet Smith	""" Harriet blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that people should like her so much ."
Harriet Smith	The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected Mr. Martin .
Harriet Smith	""" Now he has got my letter , "" said she softly ."
Harriet Smith	""" I wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too . I hope he will not mind it so very much ."
Harriet Smith	""" At this moment , perhaps , Mr. Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original , and after being asked for it five or six times , allowing them to hear your name , your own dear name . "" "" My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond - street ."
Harriet Smith	""" "" Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton ."
Harriet Smith	No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow .
Harriet Smith	It opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession .
Harriet Smith	Harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger .
Harriet Smith	How does Miss Smith do ?
Harriet Smith	She seems quite recovered now .
Harriet Smith	Emma , alone with her father , had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry-- and to marry strangers too -- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject . It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news , as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long ; but she was sorry for Harriet :
Harriet Smith	Harriet must feel it -- and all that she could hope was , by giving the first information herself , to save her from hearing it abruptly from others .
Harriet Smith	"If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning to rain , Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs. Goddard 's , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation . The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the "" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened ! "" which instantly burst forth , had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation ."
Harriet Smith	As the blow was given , Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and Harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell .
Harriet Smith	""" She had set out from Mrs. Goddard 's half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to Hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford's . ""--Ford 's was the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper , and haberdasher 's shop united ; the shop first in size and fashion in the place.--""And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in-- to be sure it was so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's-- who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!-- Dear Miss Woodhouse ! only think ."
Harriet Smith	As Harriet described it , there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour .
Harriet Smith	They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet 's acquaintance : and besides , what was the value of Harriet 's description?--So easily pleased -- so little discerning;-- what signified her praise ?
Harriet Smith	"She exerted herself , and did try to make her comfortable , by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle , and quite unworthy of being dwelt on , "" It might be distressing , for the moment , "" said she ; "" but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never-- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it . """
Harriet Smith	"Harriet said , "" very true , "" and she "" would not think about it ; "" but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else ; and Emma , at last , in order to put the Martins out of her head , was obliged to hurry on the news , which she had meant to give with so much tender caution ; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry , ashamed or only amused , at such a state of mind in poor Harriet -- such a conclusion of Mr. Elton 's importance with her !"
Harriet Smith	Mr. Elton 's rights , however , gradually revived .
Harriet Smith	As Harriet now lived , the Martins could not get at her , without seeking her , where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her ; for since her refusal of the brother , the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard 's ; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again , with any necessity , or even any power of speech .
Harriet Smith	VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet 's fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton 's being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet 's side , as there could be any occasion for .
Harriet Smith	He talked of Harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add .
Harriet Smith	"His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet 's manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment . "" You have given Miss Smith all that she required , "" said he ; "" you have made her graceful and easy ."
Harriet Smith	She was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature .
Harriet Smith	""" I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints ."
Harriet Smith	She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself .
Harriet Smith	I have done very little .
Harriet Smith	She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet 's picture .
Harriet Smith	""" Did you ever have your likeness taken , Harriet ? "" said she : "" did you ever sit for your picture ? """
Harriet Smith	"Harriet was on the point of leaving the room , and only stopt to say , with a very interesting naivete , "" Oh ! dear , no , never . """
Harriet Smith	"No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed , "" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be !"
Harriet Smith	I almost long to attempt her likeness myself .
Harriet Smith	You do not know it I dare say , but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general .
Harriet Smith	But really , I could almost venture , if Harriet would sit to me .
Harriet Smith	"It would be such a delight to have her picture ! "" "" Let me entreat you , "" cried Mr. Elton ; "" it would indeed be a delight !"
Harriet Smith	Let me entreat you , Miss Woodhouse , to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend .
Harriet Smith	Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room , at Randalls ?
Harriet Smith	Keep your raptures for Harriet 's face .
Harriet Smith	""" Well , if you give me such kind encouragement , Mr. Elton , I believe I shall try what I can do ."
Harriet Smith	"Harriet 's features are very delicate , which makes a likeness difficult ; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch . """
Harriet Smith	""" But I am afraid , Mr. Elton , Harriet will not like to sit ."
Harriet Smith	She thinks so little of her own beauty .
Harriet Smith	Did not you observe her manner of answering me ?
Harriet Smith	How completely it meant , ` why should my picture be drawn ? '
Harriet Smith	yes , I observed it , I assure you .
Harriet Smith	It was not lost on me .
Harriet Smith	"But still I can not imagine she would not be persuaded . "" Harriet was soon back again , and the proposal almost immediately made ; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others ."
Harriet Smith	Emma wished to go to work directly , and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits , for not one of them had ever been finished , that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet . Her many beginnings were displayed . Miniatures , half - lengths , whole - lengths , pencil , crayon , and water - colours had been all tried in turn .
Harriet Smith	Mrs. Weston again , and again , and again , you see .
Harriet Smith	Dear Mrs. Weston !
Harriet Smith	She would sit whenever I asked her .
Harriet Smith	"I could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when I had really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs . Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it _ very _ like)--only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side -- after all this , came poor dear Isabella 's cold approbation of--""Yes , it was a little like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice ."
Harriet Smith	We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all .
Harriet Smith	"It was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than I could bear ; and so I never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and , as I said , I did then forswear ever drawing any body again . But for Harriet 's sake , or rather for my own , and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _ at _ _ present _ , I will break my resolution now . """
Harriet Smith	It was to be a whole - length in water - colours , like Mr. John Knightley 's , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece . The sitting began ; and Harriet , smiling and blushing , and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist .
Harriet Smith	"It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith 's . """
Harriet Smith	Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace .
Harriet Smith	Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr. Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again .
Harriet Smith	"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted,""--observed Mrs. Weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover.--""The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes ."
Harriet Smith	"It is the fault of her face that she has them not . "" "" Do you think so ? "" replied he ."
Harriet Smith	""" You have made her too tall , Emma , "" said Mr. Knightley ."
Harriet Smith	Consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know .
Harriet Smith	it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith 's .
Harriet Smith	The only thing I do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold .
Harriet Smith	""" But , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer ."
Harriet Smith	""" You , sir , may say any thing , "" cried Mr. Elton , "" but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of Miss Smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit !"
Harriet Smith	The naivete of Miss Smith 's manners -- and altogether -- Oh , it is most admirable !
Harriet Smith	""" "" He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world,""--brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and a very few minutes settled the business . Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough ."
Harriet Smith	He is an excellent young man , and will suit Harriet exactly ; it will be an ` Exactly so , ' as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal .
Harriet Smith	"But it is his gratitude on Harriet 's account . """
Harriet Smith	But while so many were devoting him to Emma , and Emma herself making him over to Harriet , Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax .
Harriet Smith	Emma and Harriet were going to walk ; he joined them ; and , on returning , they fell in with a larger party , who , like themselves , judged it wisest to take their exercise early , as the weather threatened rain ; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son , Miss Bates and her niece , who had accidentally met .
Harriet Smith	If meant to be immediately mixed with the others , and buried from sight , she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across , for it was not mixed ; and Harriet , eager after every fresh word , and finding out none , directly took it up , and fell to work .
Harriet Smith	She was sitting by Mr. Knightley , and turned to him for help .
Harriet Smith	The word was _ blunder _ ; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it , there was a blush on Jane 's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible .
Harriet Smith	XVI The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst of all .
Harriet Smith	Every part of it brought pain and humiliation , of some sort or other ; but , compared with the evil to Harriet , all was light ; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken-- more in error -- more disgraced by mis - judgment , than she actually was , could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself .
Harriet Smith	""" If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man , I could have borne any thing ."
Harriet Smith	"He might have doubled his presumption to me-- but poor Harriet ! "" How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet -- never !"
Harriet Smith	The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!-- and the charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;-- how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet .
Harriet Smith	Certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet 's friend . To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility .
Harriet Smith	"She was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more . "" Here have I , "" said she , "" actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man . She might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if I had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him . Oh !"
Harriet Smith	that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin .
Harriet Smith	I was introducing her into good company , and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having ; I ought not to have attempted more .
Harriet Smith	But now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time .
Harriet Smith	I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _ not _ to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her;--William Coxe -- Oh !
Harriet Smith	She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be . The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet , and all that poor Harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully . To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma 's , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits .
Harriet Smith	, they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope . Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it . It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that Harriet 's nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive-- and that there could be no necessity for any body 's knowing what had passed except the three principals , and
Harriet Smith	especially for her father 's being given a moment 's uneasiness about it
Harriet Smith	These were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present .
Harriet Smith	"The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton 's absenting himself . It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them,-- "" Ah !"
Harriet Smith	But with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all the present comfort of delay , there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet , as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease .
Harriet Smith	She was then interrupted by Harriet 's coming in ; and if Harriet 's praise could have satisfied her , she might soon have been comforted .
Harriet Smith	""" Oh ! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax ! "" "" Do n't class us together , Harriet ."
Harriet Smith	dear -- I think you play the best of the two .
Harriet Smith	"I think you play quite as well as she does . I am sure I had much rather hear you . Every body last night said how well you played . "" "" Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference ."
Harriet Smith	The truth is , Harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but Jane Fairfax 's is much beyond it .
Harriet Smith	""" Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out ."
Harriet Smith	"but Jane Fairfax has them both , Harriet . """
Harriet Smith	""" Are you sure ?"
Harriet Smith	I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste .
Harriet Smith	And I hate Italian singing.-- There is no understanding a word of it .
Harriet Smith	Besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach . The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family .
Harriet Smith	How did you think the Coxes looked ?
Harriet Smith	""" "" Just as they always do -- very vulgar . "" "" They told me something , "" said Harriet rather hesitatingly ; "" but it is nothing of any consequence ."
Harriet Smith	"Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her , though fearful of its producing Mr. Elton . """
Harriet Smith	They told me -- that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday .
Harriet Smith	"Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him . "" "" Very likely.--I think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury . "" Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go with her ."
Harriet Smith	Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible , and in her present state , would be dangerous .
Harriet Smith	Harriet , tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word , was always very long at a purchase ; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind , Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;-- Mr. Perry walking hastily by , Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the office - door , Mr. Cole 's carriage - horses returning from exercise , or a stray letter - boy on an obstinate mule , were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect ; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray , a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket , two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone , and a string of dawdling children round the baker 's little bow - window eyeing the gingerbread , she knew she had no reason to complain , and was amused enough ; quite enough still to stand at the door .
Harriet Smith	""" Me !"
Harriet Smith	I should be quite in the way .
Harriet Smith	But , perhaps -- I may be equally in the way here .
Harriet Smith	Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me .
Harriet Smith	My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping . She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same .
Harriet Smith	What am I to do ?
Harriet Smith	""" "" I do not believe any such thing , "" replied Emma.--""I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent ."
Harriet Smith	Quite otherwise indeed , if I understood Miss Fairfax 's opinion last night .
Harriet Smith	""" "" Do come with me , "" said Mrs. Weston , "" if it be not very disagreeable to you ."
Harriet Smith	I really wish you to call with me .
Harriet Smith	"and I always thought you meant it . "" He could say no more ; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates 's door ."
Harriet Smith	Emma watched them in , and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern . At last it was all settled , even to the destination of the parcel .
Harriet Smith	""" Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard 's , ma'am ? "" asked Mrs. Ford.-- "" Yes -- no -- yes , to Mrs. Goddard 's ."
Harriet Smith	Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield .
Harriet Smith	No , you shall send it to Hartfield , if you please . But then , Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gown home any day .
Harriet Smith	But I shall want the ribbon directly-- so it had better go to Hartfield -- at least the ribbon .
Harriet Smith	You could make it into two parcels , Mrs. Ford , could not you ?
Harriet Smith	""" It is not worth while , Harriet , to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two parcels"
Harriet Smith	""" No trouble in the world , ma'am , "" said the obliging Mrs. Ford ."
Harriet Smith	but indeed I would much rather have it only in one .
Harriet Smith	Then , if you please , you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's-- I do not know -- No , I think , Miss Woodhouse , I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield , and take it home with me at night .
Harriet Smith	"What do you advise ? "" "" That you do not give another half - second to the subject . To Hartfield , if you please , Mrs. Ford . "" "" Aye , that will be much best , "" said Harriet , quite satisfied , "" I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard 's ."
Harriet Smith	"My dear Miss Woodhouse , "" said the latter , "" I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while , and give us your opinion of our new instrument ; you and Miss Smith ."
Harriet Smith	How do you do , Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me , that I might be sure of succeeding .
Harriet Smith	""" I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are-- "" "" Very well , I am much obliged to you ."
Harriet Smith	My mother is delightfully well ; and Jane caught no cold last night .
Harriet Smith	How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad to hear such a good account .
Harriet Smith	Mrs. Weston told me you were here.-- Oh !
Harriet Smith	I dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off .
Harriet Smith	""" What was I talking of ? "" said she , beginning again when they were all in the street ."
Harriet Smith	I do congratulate you , Mrs. Weston , most warmly .
Harriet Smith	for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could .
Harriet Smith	Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door ; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to , pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good - will .
Harriet Smith	"My dear Miss Woodhouse , "" said the latter , "" I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while , and give us your opinion of our new instrument ; you and Miss Smith ."
Harriet Smith	How do you do , Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me , that I might be sure of succeeding .
Harriet Smith	` I am sure you must be , ' said he , ` and I will send you another supply
Harriet Smith	I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing .
Harriet Smith	Miss Smith , pray take care .
Harriet Smith	"Miss Smith , the step at the turning . """
Harriet Smith	Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love .
Harriet Smith	Her ideas only varied as to the how much .
Harriet Smith	At first , she thought it was a good deal ; and afterwards , but little .
Harriet Smith	She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of ; and , for his sake , greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston ; she was very often thinking of him , and quite impatient for a letter , that she might know how he was , how were his spirits , how was his aunt , and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring . But , on the other hand , she could not admit herself to be unhappy , nor , after the first morning , to be less disposed for employment than usual ; she was still busy and cheerful ; and , pleasing as he was , she could yet imagine him to have faults ; and farther , though thinking of him so much , and , as she sat drawing or working , forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment , fancying interesting dialogues , and inventing elegant letters ; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _ refused _ _ him _ .
Harriet Smith	"Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting ; but still they were to part . When she became sensible of this , it struck her that she could not be very much in love ; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father , never to marry , a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings . "" I do not find myself making any use of the word _ sacrifice _ , "" said she.-- "" In not one of all my clever replies , my delicate negatives , is there any allusion to making a sacrifice ."
Harriet Smith	I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness .
Harriet Smith	I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do .
Harriet Smith	I am quite enough in love .
Harriet Smith	I should be sorry to be more .
Harriet Smith	""" Upon the whole , she was equally contented with her view of his feelings . """
Harriet Smith	_ He _ is undoubtedly very much in love -- every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed!--and when he comes again , if his affection continue , I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up . Not
Harriet Smith	I
Harriet Smith	imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto
Harriet Smith	No , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched .
Harriet Smith	Could he have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at parting would have been different.-- Still , however , I must be on my guard .
Harriet Smith	"This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but I do not know that I expect it will ; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man-- I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.-- His feelings are warm , but I can imagine them rather changeable.-- Every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well again after a little while -- and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and I shall have been let off easily . """
Harriet Smith	When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived , Emma had the perusal of it ; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations , and think she had undervalued their strength .
Harriet Smith	No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern ; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston ; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe , the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt , and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm of her own name was not wanting . _ Miss _ _ Woodhouse _ appeared more than once , and never without a something of pleasing connexion , either a compliment to her taste , or a remembrance of what she had said ; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye , unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry , she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed .
Harriet Smith	"Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words--""I had not a spare moment on Tuesday , as you know , for Miss Woodhouse 's beautiful little friend"
Harriet Smith	"Pray make my excuses and adieus to her . """
Harriet Smith	This , Emma could not doubt , was all for herself .
Harriet Smith	Harriet was remembered only from being _ her _ friend .
Harriet Smith	His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated ; Mrs. Churchill was recovering , and he dared not yet , even in his own imagination , fix a time for coming to Randalls again . Gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part , its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to Mrs. Weston , that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer , and that he must learn to do without her . Her intentions were unchanged .
Harriet Smith	Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness .
Harriet Smith	"His recollection of Harriet , and the words which clothed it , the "" beautiful little friend , "" suggested to her the idea of Harriet 's succeeding her in his affections ."
Harriet Smith	Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding ; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner ; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For Harriet , it would be advantageous and delightful indeed .
Harriet Smith	""" I must not dwell upon it , "" said she.--""I must not think of it ."
Harriet Smith	I know the danger of indulging such speculations . But stranger things have happened ; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now , it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure .
Harriet Smith	""" It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet 's behalf , though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom ; for evil in that quarter was at hand . As Frank Churchill 's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton 's engagement in the conversation of Highbury , as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first , so now upon Frank Churchill 's disappearance , Mr. Elton 's concerns were assuming the most irresistible form.--His"
Harriet Smith	"There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before "" Mr. Elton and his bride "" was in every body 's mouth , and Frank Churchill was forgotten . Emma grew sick at the sound ."
Harriet Smith	She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton ; and Harriet 's mind , she had been willing to hope , had been lately gaining strength .
Harriet Smith	With Mr. Weston 's ball in view at least , there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things ; but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach -- new carriage , bell - ringing , and all .
Harriet Smith	Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give .
Harriet Smith	Emma felt that she could not do too much for her , that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience ; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect , for ever agreed to , without being able to make their opinions the same .
Harriet Smith	"Harriet listened submissively , and said "" it was very true-- it was just as Miss Woodhouse described -- it was not worth while to think about them -- and she would not think about them any longer "" but no change of subject could avail , and the next half - hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before ."
Harriet Smith	At last Emma attacked her on another ground .
Harriet Smith	""" Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton 's marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _ me _ ."
Harriet Smith	You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into . It was all my doing , I know . I have not forgotten it , I assure you.--Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you-- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever .
Harriet Smith	"Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it . "" Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation ."
Harriet Smith	"Emma continued , "" I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity ."
Harriet Smith	These are the motives which I have been pressing on you .
Harriet Smith	They are very important -- and sorry I am that you can not feel them sufficiently to act upon them .
Harriet Smith	My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration .
Harriet Smith	I want you to save yourself from greater pain .
Harriet Smith	"Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me . "" This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest . The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably . """
Harriet Smith	You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life-- Want gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I do for you!--Oh !
Harriet Smith	"Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been ! """
Harriet Smith	, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well , nor valued her affection so highly before .
Harriet Smith	""" There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart , "" said she afterwards to herself . "" There is nothing to be compared to it ."
Harriet Smith	Warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , I am sure it will .
Harriet Smith	It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives Isabella all her popularity.-- I have it not -- but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet
Harriet Smith	is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives .
Harriet Smith	Dear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing .
Harriet Smith	the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a hundred such --
Harriet Smith	"I mention no names ; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet ! """
Harriet Smith	The coming of her sister 's family was so very near at hand , that first in anticipation , and then in reality , it became henceforth her prime object of interest ; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected -- she did not herself expect-- that any thing beyond occasional , fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers .
Harriet Smith	They might advance rapidly if they would , however ; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no . She hardly wished to have more leisure for them .
Harriet Smith	Till this year , every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey ; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea - bathing for the children , and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions , or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse , who could not be induced to get so far as London , even for poor Isabella 's sake ; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit . He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety .
Harriet Smith	The bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them .
Harriet Smith	He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing . He was not a great favourite with his fair sister - in - law .
Harriet Smith	She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella , which Isabella never felt herself .
Harriet Smith	Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella 's sister , but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of respectful forbearance towards her father . There he had not always the patience that could have been wished .
Harriet Smith	It did not often happen ; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great regard for his father - in - law , and generally a strong sense of what was due to him ; but it was too often for Emma 's charity , especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured , though the offence came not .
Harriet Smith	The beginning , however , of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings , and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality .
Harriet Smith	""" Oh yes , sir , "" cried she with ready sympathy , "" how you must miss her !"
Harriet Smith	And dear Emma , too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!-- I have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her.--It
Harriet Smith	""" Pretty well , my dear -- I hope -- pretty well.--I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably . "" Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls ."
Harriet Smith	""" Oh !"
Harriet Smith	no -- none in the least .
Harriet Smith	Papa is only speaking his own regret .
Harriet Smith	""" "" Very much to the honour of both , "" was the handsome reply ."
Harriet Smith	""" And do you see her , sir , tolerably often ? "" asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father ."
Harriet Smith	Either in the morning or evening of every day , excepting one , have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston , and generally both , either at Randalls or here -- and as you may suppose , Isabella , most frequently here .
Harriet Smith	"Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed , but every body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated -- which is the exact truth . """
Harriet Smith	Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy .
Harriet Smith	I have been always telling you , my love , that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have Emma 's account , I hope you will be satisfied .
Harriet Smith	""" Why , to be sure , "" said Mr. Woodhouse--""yes , certainly -- I can not deny that Mrs. Weston , poor Mrs. Weston , does come and see us pretty often-- but then -- she is always obliged to go away again ."
Harriet Smith	""" "" It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not , papa.-- You quite forget poor Mr. Weston . "" "" I think , indeed , "" said John Knightley pleasantly , "" that Mr. Weston has some little claim ."
Harriet Smith	I , being a husband , and you not being a wife , the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force .
Harriet Smith	""" "" Me , my love , "" cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part.-- "" Are you talking about me?--I"
Harriet Smith	am sure nobody ought to be , or can be , a greater advocate for matrimony than I am ; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield , I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world ; and as to slighting Mr. Weston , that excellent Mr. Weston , I think there is nothing he does not deserve .
Harriet Smith	Excepting yourself and your brother , I do not know his equal for temper .
Harriet Smith	I shall never forget his flying Henry 's kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o'clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham , I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him , it must be Miss Taylor .
Harriet Smith	""" Where is the young man ? "" said John Knightley ."
Harriet Smith	""" Has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not ? "" "" He has not been here yet , "" replied Emma ."
Harriet Smith	I thought it very well done of him indeed .
Harriet Smith	Whether it was his own idea you know , one can not tell .
Harriet Smith	"You forget how time passes . "" "" Three - and - twenty!--is he indeed?--Well , I could not have thought it-- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother !"
Harriet Smith	"However , it was an exceeding good , pretty letter , and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of pleasure . I remember it was written from Weymouth , and dated Sept. 28th -- and began , ` My dear Madam , ' but I forget how it went on ; and it was signed ` F. C. Weston Churchill . '-- I remember that perfectly . "" "" How very pleasing and proper of him ! "" cried the good - hearted Mrs. John Knightley ."
Harriet Smith	""" I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man ."
Harriet Smith	But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father !
Harriet Smith	There is something so shocking in a child 's being taken away from his parents and natural home !
Harriet Smith	To give up one 's child !
Harriet Smith	""" "" Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills , I fancy , "" observed Mr. John Knightley coolly ."
Harriet Smith	"Mr. Weston is rather an easy , cheerful - tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , I suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords . "" Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass ."
Harriet Smith	She would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all - sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother 's disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance .
Harriet Smith	""" More than an attachment , indeed , "" resumed Mrs. Weston ; "" an engagement-- a positive engagement.--What will you say , Emma -- what will any body say , when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged;--nay , that they have been long engaged ! """
Harriet Smith	mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation .
Harriet Smith	""" "" Ah ! "" thought Emma , "" he would have done as much for Harriet . "" "" This was settled last night , and Frank was off with the light this morning ."
Harriet Smith	As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them , Emma 's fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy . Her father -- and Harriet .
Harriet Smith	While he lived , it must be only an engagement ; but she flattered herself , that if divested of the danger of drawing her away , it might become an increase of comfort to him.-- How to do her best by Harriet , was of more difficult decision;-- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain ; how to make her any possible atonement ; how to appear least her enemy?-- On these subjects , her perplexity and distress were very great-- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.-- She could only resolve at last , that she would still avoid a meeting with her , and communicate all that need be told by letter ; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury , and -- indulging in one scheme more-- nearly resolve , that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet ; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.-- She did not think it in Harriet 's nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety , by the streets , the shops , and the children.-- At any rate , it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself , from whom every thing was due ; a separation for the present ; an averting of the evil day , when they must all be together again .
Harriet Smith	She rose early , and wrote her letter to Harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that Mr. Knightley , in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before .
Harriet Smith	I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness .
Harriet Smith	Every possibility of good was before me , and the first of blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence .
Harriet Smith	You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury ; and as _ you _ were the person slighted , you will forgive me instantly ; but I must work on my father 's compassion , by reminding him , that so long as I absented myself from his house , so long I lost the blessing of knowing you .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again .
Harriet Smith	Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him .
Harriet Smith	"All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I believed none of it . """
Harriet Smith	Ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell 's , I made up my mind on the subject .
Harriet Smith	I planned the match from that hour ; and when such success has blessed me in this instance , dear papa , you can not think that I shall leave off match - making .
Harriet Smith	""" "" I do not understand what you mean by ` success , ' "" said Mr. Knightley ."
Harriet Smith	""" Success supposes endeavour ."
Harriet Smith	Your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage .
Harriet Smith	But if , which I rather imagine , your making the match , as you call it , means only your planning it , your saying to yourself one idle day , ` I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her , ' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards , why do you talk of success ?
Harriet Smith	"Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet 's account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of . """
Harriet Smith	In such a party , Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise ; but for the poor girl herself , it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Knightley , always so kind , so feeling , so truly considerate for every body , would never deserve to be less worshipped than now ; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet , that she could be in love with more than _ three _ men in one year .
Harriet Smith	She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield .
Harriet Smith	She would be a loser in every way .
Harriet Smith	Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment .
Harriet Smith	In such a party , Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise ; but for the poor girl herself , it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment .
Harriet Smith	"XI "" Harriet , poor Harriet!""--Those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her . Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself -- very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _ his _ behaviour as her _ own _ , which made her so angry with him ."
Harriet Smith	It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet 's account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet ! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery .
Harriet Smith	"Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , "" Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith . ""--She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet 's imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments ."
Harriet Smith	Her influence would have been enough . And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been risking her friend 's happiness on most insufficient grounds .
Harriet Smith	"Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet , that she must not allow herself to think of him , and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--""But , with common sense , "" she added , "" I am afraid I have had little to do . """
Harriet Smith	Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous.-- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted .
Harriet Smith	There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else . Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first . Considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet 's mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would.-- She must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible . An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston 's parting words .
Harriet Smith	Emma had promised ; but still Harriet must be excepted .
Harriet Smith	In spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet , which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself .
Harriet Smith	The intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another . Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet 's footstep and voice ; so , she supposed , had poor Mrs. Weston felt when _ she _ was approaching Randalls .
Harriet Smith	""" Well , Miss Woodhouse ! "" cried Harriet , coming eagerly into the room-- "" is not this the oddest news that ever was ? """
Harriet Smith	""" What news do you mean ? "" replied Emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint ."
Harriet Smith	Did you ever hear any thing so strange ?
Harriet Smith	Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for Mr. Weston has told me himself .
Harriet Smith	He told me it was to be a great secret ; and , therefore , I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you , but he said you knew it .
Harriet Smith	""" "" What did Mr. Weston tell you?""--said Emma , still perplexed ."
Harriet Smith	""" It was , indeed , so odd ; Harriet 's behaviour was so extremely odd , that Emma did not know how to understand it . Her character appeared"
Harriet Smith	absolutely changed
Harriet Smith	She seemed to propose shewing no agitation , or disappointment , or peculiar concern in the discovery .
Harriet Smith	Emma looked at her , quite unable to speak .
Harriet Smith	""" Had you any idea , "" cried Harriet , "" of his being in love with her?--You , perhaps , might.--You ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body 's heart ; but nobody else--"
Harriet Smith	Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly-- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr. Frank Churchill 's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax . You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly .
Harriet Smith	""" "" Me ! "" cried Harriet , colouring , and astonished ."
Harriet Smith	""" Why should you caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill . "" "" I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject , "" replied Emma , smiling ; "" but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ?"
Harriet Smith	"Dear Miss Woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ? "" turning away distressed ."
Harriet Smith	""" Harriet ! "" cried Emma , after a moment 's pause--""What do you mean?--"
Harriet Smith	"Good Heaven ! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?-- "" She could not speak another word.--Her"
Harriet Smith	"Harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma 's . "" I should not have thought it possible , "" she began , "" that you could have misunderstood me ! I know we agreed never to name him-- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else , I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person . Mr. Frank Churchill , indeed !"
Harriet Smith	I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other .
Harriet Smith	I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill , who is like nobody by his side .
Harriet Smith	And that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing!--I am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him .
Harriet Smith	At first , if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened ; that there had been matches of greater disparity ( those were your very words);-- I should not have dared to give way to -- I should not have thought it possible --
Harriet Smith	"But if _ you _ , who had been always acquainted with him-- "" "" Harriet ! "" cried Emma , collecting herself resolutely--""Let us understand each other now , without the possibility of farther mistake ."
Harriet Smith	"Are you speaking of -- Mr. Knightley ? "" "" To be sure I am . I never could have an idea of any body else-- and so I thought you knew . When we talked about him , it was as clear as possible ."
Harriet Smith	""" Not quite , "" returned Emma , with forced calmness , "" for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person ."
Harriet Smith	I could almost assert that you had _ named _ Mr. Frank Churchill .
Harriet Smith	I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , was spoken of .
Harriet Smith	""" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how you do forget ! "" """
Harriet Smith	My dear Harriet , I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion .
Harriet Smith	I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The
Harriet Smith	impression of it is strong on my memory .
Harriet Smith	""" Oh , dear , "" cried Harriet , "" now I recollect what you mean ; but I was thinking of something very different at the time ."
Harriet Smith	( with some elevation ) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance-- of Mr. Knightley 's coming and asking me to dance , when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me ; and when there was no other partner in the room .
Harriet Smith	That was the kind action ; that was the noble benevolence and generosity ; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth .
Harriet Smith	""" You would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ?"
Harriet Smith	"At least , however , I can not be worse off than I should have been , if the other had been the person ; and now -- it _ is _ possible-- "" She paused a few moments ."
Harriet Smith	""" I do not wonder , Miss Woodhouse , "" she resumed , "" that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body ."
Harriet Smith	You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other .
Harriet Smith	But I hope , Miss Woodhouse , that supposing -- that if-- strange as it may appear-- . But you know they were your own words , that _ more _ wonderful things had happened , matches of _ greater _ disparity had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me ; and , therefore , it seems as if such a thing even as this , may have occurred before-- and
Harriet Smith	"if I should be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to-- if Mr. Knightley should really -- if _ he _ does not mind the disparity , I hope , dear Miss Woodhouse , you will not set yourself against it , and try to put difficulties in the way . But you are too good for that , I am sure . "" Harriet was standing at one of the windows ."
Harriet Smith	"Emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said , "" Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley 's returning your affection ? "" "" Yes , "" replied Harriet modestly , but not fearfully--""I must say that I have . "" Emma 's eyes were instantly withdrawn ; and she sat silently meditating , in a fixed attitude , for a few minutes ."
Harriet Smith	Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley , than with Frank Churchill ?
Harriet Smith	Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet 's having some hope of a return ?
Harriet Smith	How inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct ! What blindness , what madness , had led her on !
Harriet Smith	Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits-- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _ compassion _ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now , ) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet 's hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right.-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost.-- Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves . Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight.--Emma 's tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet 's , but they were not less .
Harriet Smith	Harriet 's detail.--Methodical , or well arranged , or very well delivered , it could not be expected to be ; but it contained , when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration , a substance to sink her spirit-- especially with the corroborating circumstances , which her own memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley 's most improved opinion of Harriet .
Harriet Smith	Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation . From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse 's encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it . When they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her . Emma knew it to have been very much the case .
Harriet Smith	She had often observed the change , to almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him-- and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet . He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings.--
Harriet Smith	She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet 's memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma .
Harriet Smith	Circumstances that might swell to half an hour 's relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush . )
Harriet Smith	He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged.-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming:-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _ her _ .
Harriet Smith	The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain . On the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question .
Harriet Smith	But Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit .
Harriet Smith	I hope I know better now , than to care for Mr. Martin , or to be suspected of it .
Harriet Smith	""" When Harriet had closed her evidence , she appealed to her dear Miss Woodhouse , to say whether she had not good ground for hope ."
Harriet Smith	""" I never should have presumed to think of it at first , "" said she , "" but for you ."
Harriet Smith	You told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine -- and so I have .
Harriet Smith	"But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . "" The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech , the many bitter feelings , made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma 's side , to enable her to say on reply , "" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . "" Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father 's footsteps . He was coming through the hall . Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him ."
Harriet Smith	""" She could not compose herself-- Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go;""--with most ready encouragement from her friend , therefore , she passed off through another door -- and the moment she was gone , this was the spontaneous burst of Emma 's feelings : "" Oh God ! that I had never seen her ! """
Harriet Smith	The rest of the day , the following night , were hardly enough for her thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours .
Harriet Smith	She was proved to have been universally mistaken ; and she had not quite done nothing -- for she had done mischief . She had brought evil on Harriet , on herself , and she too much feared , on
Harriet Smith	to take place , on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning ; for his attachment , she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet's;--and even were this not the case , he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly .
Harriet Smith	Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became commonplace , threadbare , stale in the comparison , exciting no surprize , presenting no disparity , affording nothing to be said or thought.--Mr . Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an elevation on her side !
Harriet Smith	Oh ! had she never brought Harriet forward !
Harriet Smith	Had she left her where she ought , and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not , with a folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong-- all would have been safe ; none of this dreadful sequel would have been .
Harriet Smith	How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!-- But Harriet was less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly.-- Her inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little felt.-- She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton 's being to stoop in marrying her , than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.-- Alas !
Harriet Smith	was not that her own doing too ?
Harriet Smith	Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self - consequence but herself?--Who but herself had taught her , that she was to elevate herself if possible , and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--
Harriet Smith	If Harriet , from being humble , were grown vain , it was her doing too .
Frank Churchill	Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence . Might not the evening end in a dance ? had been a question of his .
Frank Churchill	And poor John 's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he can not keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr. Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond .
Frank Churchill	"It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton . "" Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill 's going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence ."
Frank Churchill	What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject , being the accumulation of the ostler 's own knowledge , and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls , was , that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill-- which messenger , however , had been no more than was expected ; and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines , containing , upon the whole , a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill , and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early ; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly , without waiting at all , and his horse seeming to have got a cold , Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise , and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by , the boy going a good pace , and driving very steady .
Frank Churchill	XII Mr. Knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of Mr. Woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella 's first day .
Frank Churchill	Emma 's sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation .
Frank Churchill	She hoped they might now become friends again . She thought it was time to make up .
Frank Churchill	Making - up indeed would not do .
Frank Churchill	_ She _ certainly had not been in the wrong , and _ he _ would never own that he had .
Frank Churchill	Concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to Hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt 's arms .
Frank Churchill	It did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity .
Frank Churchill	"Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby , "" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces . As to men and women , our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard to these children , I observe we never disagree ."
Frank Churchill	""" "" If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women , and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them , as you are where these children are concerned , we might always think alike . """
Frank Churchill	""" To be sure -- our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong . "" "" Yes , "" said he , smiling--""and reason good ."
Frank Churchill	I was sixteen years old when you were born .
Frank Churchill	""" "" A material difference then , "" she replied--""and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one - and - twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ?"
Frank Churchill	""" I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child ."
Frank Churchill	Come , my dear Emma , let us be friends , and say no more about it . Tell your aunt , little Emma , that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances , and that if she were not wrong before , she is now .
Frank Churchill	Little Emma , grow up a better woman than your aunt . Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited . Now , Mr. Knightley , a word or two more , and I
Frank Churchill	"This had just taken place and with great cordiality , when John Knightley made his appearance , and "" How d'ye do , George ? "" and "" John , how are you ? "" succeeded in the true English style , burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference , the real attachment which would have led either of them , if requisite , to do every thing for the good of the other . The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other . The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits , but principally of those of the elder , whose temper was by much the most communicative , and who was always the greater talker . As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong ."
Frank Churchill	The plan of a drain , the change of a fence , the felling of a tree , and the destination of every acre for wheat , turnips , or spring corn , was entered into with as much equality of interest by John , as his cooler manners rendered possible ; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about , his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness .
Frank Churchill	While they were thus comfortably occupied , Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter .
Frank Churchill	""" My poor dear Isabella , "" said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children--""How long it is , how terribly long since you were here ! And how tired you must be after your journey !"
Frank Churchill	You must go to bed early , my dear -- and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together .
Frank Churchill	"My dear Emma , suppose we all have a little gruel . "" Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;--and two basins only were ordered ."
Frank Churchill	"After a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection , "" It was an awkward business , my dear , your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here ."
Frank Churchill	"I never had much opinion of the sea air . """
Frank Churchill	It makes me envious and miserable;-- I who have never seen it !
Frank Churchill	South End is prohibited , if you please .
Frank Churchill	My dear Isabella , I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet ; and he never forgets you .
Frank Churchill	Poor Perry is bilious , and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country .
Frank Churchill	"But then there is not so clever a man any where . "" "" And Mrs. Perry and the children , how are they ?"
Frank Churchill	do the children grow ?
Frank Churchill	"He will be so pleased to see my little ones . "" "" I hope he will be here to - morrow , for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence ."
Frank Churchill	"And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella 's throat . "" "" Oh !"
Frank Churchill	my dear sir , her throat is so much better that I have hardly any uneasiness about it .
Frank Churchill	Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr. Wingfield 's , which we have been applying at times ever since August .
Frank Churchill	""" It is not very likely , my dear , that bathing should have been of use to her -- and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation , I would have spoken to-- "" You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates , "" said Emma , "" I have not heard one inquiry after them . """
Frank Churchill	the good Bateses -- I am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters .
Frank Churchill	Good old Mrs. Bates -- I will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.-- And that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!-- How are they , sir ?
Frank Churchill	Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy -- except when it has been quite an influenza .
Frank Churchill	""" That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention ."
Frank Churchill	Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season .
Frank Churchill	""" No , I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _ very _ sickly except-- "" Ah !"
Frank Churchill	my poor dear child , the truth is , that in London it is always a sickly season .
Frank Churchill	""" No , indeed--_we _ are not at all in a bad air ."
Frank Churchill	Our part of London is very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London in general , my dear sir .
Frank Churchill	""" Ah !"
Frank Churchill	my dear , it is not like Hartfield .
Frank Churchill	"You make the best of it-- but after you have been a week at Hartfield , you are all of you different creatures ; you do not look like the same . Now I can not say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present . "" "" I am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but I assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere , I am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming ."
Frank Churchill	I hope you will think better of their looks to - morrow ; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case .
Frank Churchill	"I think Mr. John Knightley very far from looking well . "" "" What is the matter , sir?--Did you speak to me ? "" cried Mr. John Knightley , hearing his own name ."
Frank Churchill	""" I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother , "" cried Emma , "" about your friend Mr. Graham 's intending to have a bailiff from Scotland , to look after his new estate ."
Frank Churchill	"Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added , "" Our little friend Harriet Smith , however , is just such another pretty kind of young person . You will like Harriet ."
Frank Churchill	This topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening
Frank Churchill	did not close without a little return of agitation .
Frank Churchill	The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments-- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable;--but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at South End , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin .
Frank Churchill	Often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable .
Frank Churchill	Here was a dangerous opening .
Frank Churchill	there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End .
Frank Churchill	And for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it , and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel .
Frank Churchill	"After an interval of some minutes , however , he began with , "" I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn , instead of coming here . """
Frank Churchill	""" But why should you be sorry , sir?--I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good . """
Frank Churchill	""" And , moreover , if you must go to the sea , it had better not have been to South End ."
Frank Churchill	""" I know there is such an idea with many people , but indeed it is quite a mistake , sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there , never found the least inconvenience from the mud ; and Mr. Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy ; and I am sure he may be depended on , for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air , and his own brother and family have been"
Frank Churchill	there repeatedly
Frank Churchill	""" "" You should have gone to Cromer , my dear , if you went anywhere.-- Perry was a week at Cromer once , and he holds it to be the best of all the sea - bathing places ."
Frank Churchill	A fine open sea , he says , and very pure air .
Frank Churchill	And , by what I understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable .
Frank Churchill	""" But , my dear sir , the difference of the journey;--only consider how great it would have been.--An hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty . "" "" Ah !"
Frank Churchill	my dear , as Perry says , where health is at stake , nothing else should be considered ; and if one is to travel , there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all , better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air .
Frank Churchill	""" Emma 's attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law 's breaking out ."
Frank Churchill	""" Mr. Perry , "" said he , in a voice of very strong displeasure , "" would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for ."
Frank Churchill	"Why does he make it any business of his , to wonder at what I do?-- at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed , I hope , the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.-- I want his directions no more than his drugs . "" He paused-- and growing cooler in a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , "" If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty , I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself ."
Frank Churchill	""" "" True , true , "" cried Mr. Knightley , with most ready interposition-- "" very true . That 's a consideration indeed.--But John , as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , I can not conceive any difficulty ."
Frank Churchill	"I should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path . . . . The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps . I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion . "" Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;-- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it ."
Frank Churchill	I am going to London , to spend a few days with John and Isabella .
Frank Churchill	How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both . It was also a very early speculation with Emma .
Frank Churchill	The character of Mrs. Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed .
Frank Churchill	Mr. Churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew .
Frank Churchill	All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed .
Frank Churchill	They spoke , therefore , of Mrs. Churchill 's death with mutual forbearance . Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans .
Frank Churchill	"I will call another day , and hear the pianoforte . "" "" Well , I am so sorry!--Oh ! Mr. Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?-- Was not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it . "" "" Oh !"
Frank Churchill	very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes .
Frank Churchill	Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .
Frank Churchill	From the expense of the child , however , he was soon relieved .
Frank Churchill	The boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother 's , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease .
Frank Churchill	Some scruples and some reluctance the widower - father may be supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome by other considerations , the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills , and he had only his own comfort to seek , and his own situation to improve as he could . A complete change of life became desirable . He quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in London , which afforded him a favourable opening . It was a concern which brought just employment enough . He had still a small house in Highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away .
Frank Churchill	He saw his son every year in London , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too .
Frank Churchill	He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern . Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .
Frank Churchill	His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved .
Frank Churchill	Now , upon his father 's marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place .
Frank Churchill	Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them ; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion .
Frank Churchill	""" I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston ?"
Frank Churchill	Mrs. Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma 's losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour 's ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr. Weston 's disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor , ' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .
Frank Churchill	He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him . Frank Churchill 's character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .
Frank Churchill	He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him . Frank Churchill 's character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .
Frank Churchill	VI The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again .
Frank Churchill	He came with Mrs. Weston , to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially .
Frank Churchill	"He had been sitting with her , it appeared , most companionably at home , till her usual hour of exercise ; and on being desired to chuse their walk , immediately fixed on Highbury.--""He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same ."
Frank Churchill	"Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction . ""-- Highbury , with Mrs. Weston , stood for Hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him . They walked thither directly ."
Frank Churchill	She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs. Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend .
Frank Churchill	If he were deficient there , nothing should make amends for it .
Frank Churchill	It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty ; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection .
Frank Churchill	And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning . They were all three walking about together for an hour or two-- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield , and afterwards in Highbury . He was delighted with every thing ; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse 's ear ; and when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village , and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed .
Frank Churchill	Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings .
Frank Churchill	He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long , and which had been the home of his father 's father ; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living , walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other ; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit , they shewed , altogether , a good - will towards Highbury in general , which must be very like a merit to those he was with .
Frank Churchill	Emma watched and decided , that with such feelings as were now shewn , it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been acting a part , or making a parade of insincere professions ; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him justice .
Frank Churchill	Their first pause was at the Crown Inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one of the sort , where a couple of pair of post - horses were kept , more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added ; it had been built many years ago for a ball - room , and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous , dancing state , had been occasionally used as such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away , and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half - gentlemen of the place . He was immediately interested .
Frank Churchill	Its character as a ball - room caught him ; and instead of passing on , he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased .
Frank Churchill	He saw no fault in the room , he would acknowledge none which they suggested .
Frank Churchill	The want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied .
Frank Churchill	He could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body 's returning into their proper place the next morning .
Frank Churchill	He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing ; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills .
Frank Churchill	He seemed to have all the life and spirit , cheerful feelings , and social inclinations of his father , and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe .
Frank Churchill	Of pride , indeed , there was , perhaps , scarcely enough ; his indifference to a confusion of rank , bordered too much on inelegance of mind .
Frank Churchill	He could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap .
Frank Churchill	"At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown ; and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged , Emma recollected his intended visit the day before , and asked him if he had paid it . "" Yes , oh ! yes""--he replied ; "" I was just going to mention it ."
Frank Churchill	A very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies ; and felt
Frank Churchill	very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me .
Frank Churchill	As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit .
Frank Churchill	Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour .
Frank Churchill	The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before .
Frank Churchill	He listened with all due deference ; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same -- but yet he must confess , that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health .
Frank Churchill	"Where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was . "" Well , "" said Emma , "" there is no disputing about taste.--At least you admire her except her complexion ."
Frank Churchill	"He shook his head and laughed.--""I can not separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion . """
Frank Churchill	""" Did you see her often at Weymouth ?"
Frank Churchill	"Were you often in the same society ? "" At this moment they were approaching Ford 's , and he hastily exclaimed , "" Ha !"
Frank Churchill	this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives , as my father informs me .
Frank Churchill	If it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that I may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of Highbury . I must buy something at Ford 's .
Frank Churchill	It will be taking out my freedom.-- I dare say they sell gloves .
Frank Churchill	I do admire your patriotism .
Frank Churchill	You will be adored in Highbury .
Frank Churchill	"You were very popular before you came , because you were Mr. Weston 's son -- but lay out half a guinea at Ford 's , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues . "" They went in ; and while the sleek , well - tied parcels of "" Men 's Beavers "" and "" York Tan "" were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said--""But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _ amor _ _ patriae _ ."
Frank Churchill	Do not let me lose it . I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life .
Frank Churchill	Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.-- I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow .
Frank Churchill	you answer as discreetly as she could do herself .
Frank Churchill	But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her .
Frank Churchill	""" "" May I , indeed?--Then I will speak the truth , and nothing suits me so well ."
Frank Churchill	I met her frequently at Weymouth .
Frank Churchill	I had known the Campbells a little in town ; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set .
Frank Churchill	"I like them all . "" "" You know Miss Fairfax 's situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ? "" "" Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do . "" "" You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , "" said Mrs. Weston smiling ; "" remember that I am here.--Mr . Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax 's situation in life ."
Frank Churchill	"He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment . When the gloves were bought , and they had quitted the shop again , "" Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ? "" said Frank Churchill ."
Frank Churchill	""" "" You think so , do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge"
Frank Churchill	She appeared to me to play well , that is , with considerable taste , but I know nothing of the matter myself.--
Frank Churchill	I am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body 's performance.--I have been used to hear her 's admired ; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:--a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- on the point of marriage-- would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead -- never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other .
Frank Churchill	That , I thought , in a man of known musical talent , was some proof .
Frank Churchill	"We shall know more about them all , in half an hour , from you , than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year . "" "" Yes , Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof . "" "" Certainly -- very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _ I _ had been Miss Campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me ."
Frank Churchill	"She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction . "" "" As to that -- I do not-- "" "" Oh ! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax 's sensations from you , or from any body else . They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself ."
Frank Churchill	""" "" There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all-- "" he began rather quickly , but checking himself , added , "" however , it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were-- how it might all be behind the scenes ."
Frank Churchill	I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly .
Frank Churchill	But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be .
Frank Churchill	""" "" I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends ."
Frank Churchill	I hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set .
Frank Churchill	And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved .
Frank Churchill	""" "" It is a most repulsive quality , indeed , "" said he ."
Frank Churchill	""" "" Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater . But I must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than I have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body 's reserve to procure one ."
Frank Churchill	Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question .
Frank Churchill	"I have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal . "" He perfectly agreed with her : and after walking together so long , and thinking so much alike , Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him , that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting . He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected ."
Frank Churchill	His ideas seemed more moderate-- his feelings warmer .
Frank Churchill	She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr. Elton 's house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with .
Frank Churchill	No , he could not believe it a bad house ; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having
Frank Churchill	If it were to be shared with the woman he loved , he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house .
Frank Churchill	The man must be a blockhead who wanted more . Mrs. Weston laughed , and said he did not know what he was talking about .
Frank Churchill	Used only to a large house himself , and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size
Frank Churchill	, he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one .
Frank Churchill	But Emma , in her own mind , determined that he _ did _ know what he was talking about , and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life , and to marry , from worthy motives .
Frank Churchill	He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper 's room , or a bad butler 's pantry , but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy , and that whenever he were attached , he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment .
Frank Churchill	what would Frank Churchill say to her , if he were here ?
Frank Churchill	How angry and how diverted he would be !
Frank Churchill	there I am-- thinking of him directly
Frank Churchill	"Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind!""-- All this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the Eltons ' departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending ."
Frank Churchill	It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying . The impertinence of the Eltons , which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening , had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of Harriet 's infatuation.-- From Harriet 's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she had strong hopes .
Frank Churchill	It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him .
Frank Churchill	She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational , Frank Churchill not too much in love , and Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her , how very happy a summer must be before her !
Frank Churchill	She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning . He had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield , as he was to be at home by the middle of the day .
Frank Churchill	Having arranged all these matters , looked them through , and put them all to rights , she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys , as well as of their grandpapa , when the great iron sweep - gate opened , and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together -- Frank Churchill , with Harriet leaning on his arm -- actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened .
Frank Churchill	Harriet looked white and frightened , and he was trying to cheer her.-- The iron gates and the front - door were not twenty yards asunder;-- they were all three soon in the hall , and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away .
Frank Churchill	How the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill.--She was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more . In this state Frank Churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , they loud and insolent . By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment . The pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward , and leave his horses to meet him by another road , a mile or two beyond Highbury-- and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates , and to have forgotten to restore them , he had been obliged to stop at her door , and go in for a few minutes : he was therefore later than he had intended ; and being on foot , was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them . The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion .
Frank Churchill	He had left them completely frightened ; and Harriet eagerly clinging to him , and hardly able to speak , had just strength enough to reach Hartfield , before her spirits were quite overcome .
Frank Churchill	It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield : he had thought of no other place .
Frank Churchill	This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and of Harriet 's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.-- He dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself .
Frank Churchill	He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself , she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton .
Frank Churchill	In the few minutes ' conversation which she had yet had with him , while Harriet had been partially insensible , he had spoken of her terror , her naivete , her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm , with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at last , after Harriet 's own account had been given , he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms .
Frank Churchill	""" It is Frank and Miss Fairfax , "" said Mrs. Weston ."
Frank Churchill	Emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- a number of embarrassing recollections on each side .
Frank Churchill	They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure .
Frank Churchill	"When Mr. Weston joined the party , however , and when the baby was fetched , there was no longer a want of subject or animation-- or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say , "" I have to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs. Weston 's letters . I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon . I hope you do not retract what you then said ."
Frank Churchill	"I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you -- and to give you joy in person . "" He thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness ."
Frank Churchill	""" Is not she looking well ? "" said he , turning his eyes towards Jane ."
Frank Churchill	""" Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston doat upon her ."
Frank Churchill	"But his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells , he named the name of Dixon.--Emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing . """
Frank Churchill	Frank Churchill caught the name .
Frank Churchill	""" Perry ! "" said he to Emma , and trying , as he spoke , to catch Miss Fairfax 's eye . "" My friend Mr. Perry !"
Frank Churchill	"What are they saying about Mr. Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel now?--Has he set up his carriage ? "" Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from Jane 's countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf ."
Frank Churchill	""" Such an extraordinary dream of mine ! "" he cried ."
Frank Churchill	""" I can never think of it without laughing.--She hears us , she hears us , Miss Woodhouse ."
Frank Churchill	I see it in her cheek , her smile , her vain attempt to frown .
Frank Churchill	He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma 's feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley 's high superiority of character .
Frank Churchill	The invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like Mrs. Elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and Mr. Weston , unasked , promised to get Frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--
Frank Churchill	Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come . In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast , that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration ; and at last Donwell was settled for one day , and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing exactly right .
Frank Churchill	The next remove was to the house ; they must all go in and eat;-- and they were all seated and busy , and still Frank Churchill did not come .
Frank Churchill	His father would not own himself uneasy , and laughed at her fears ; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare .
Frank Churchill	"And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more I shall like you . "" Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St. Mark 's Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room ."
Frank Churchill	Emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him .
Frank Churchill	Mrs. Weston would be at ease .
Frank Churchill	""" You will soon be cooler , if you sit still , "" said Emma ."
Frank Churchill	Emma listened , and looked , and soon perceived that Frank Churchill 's state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour . Some people were always cross when they were hot .
Frank Churchill	Such might be his constitution ; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room -- and she humanely pointed out the door .
Frank Churchill	""" No -- he should not eat ."
Frank Churchill	"He was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter . """
Frank Churchill	"Emma returned all her attention to her father , saying in secret-- "" I am glad I have done being in love with him . I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning ."
Frank Churchill	"John Knightley looked at him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and said , "" I could not have believed it even of _ him _ . "" Mr. Weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room . He gave her a letter , it was from Frank , and to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it . "" Read it , read it , "" said he , "" it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma . "" The two ladies looked over it together ; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time , in a voice a little subdued , but very audible to every body ."
Frank Churchill	Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think .
Frank Churchill	Well , what do you say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I?--Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me?--In town next week , you see -- at the latest , I dare say ; for _ she _ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or Saturday .
Frank Churchill	But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again , so near as town . They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us .
Frank Churchill	Frank comes to - morrow -- I had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty-- he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so .
Frank Churchill	If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days ; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather .
Frank Churchill	"We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish . """
Frank Churchill	To know that _ she _ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy .
Frank Churchill	The worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment 's thought , she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more .
Frank Churchill	"Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated . "" I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield , "" said he , at the conclusion . Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife ."
Frank Churchill	""" Well , well , I am ready;""--and turning again to Emma , "" but you must not be expecting such a _ very _ fine young man ; you have only had _ my _ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:""-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction ."
Frank Churchill	""" Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three , "" was Mr. Weston 's quick amendment ; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting ."
Frank Churchill	Emma 's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness ; every thing wore a different air ; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before . When she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to Harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there .
Frank Churchill	""" My dear , dear anxious friend,""--said she , in mental soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , "" always overcareful for every body 's comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right . """
Frank Churchill	"I am sure they will bring him soon . """
Frank Churchill	She opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr. Weston and his son .
Frank Churchill	They had been arrived only a few minutes , and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank 's being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure .
Frank Churchill	The Frank Churchill so long talked of , so high in interest , was actually before her -- he was presented to her , and she did not think too much had been said in his praise ; he was a _ very _ good looking young man ; height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father 's ; he looked quick and sensible .
Frank Churchill	She felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well - bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be .
Frank Churchill	He had reached Randalls the evening before .
Frank Churchill	She was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan , and travel earlier , later , and quicker , that he might gain half a day .
Frank Churchill	""" I told you yesterday , "" cried Mr. Weston with exultation , "" I told you all that he would be here before the time named ."
Frank Churchill	""" "" It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it , "" said the young man , "" though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far ; but in coming _ home _ I felt I might do any thing . "" The word _ home _ made his father look on him with fresh complacency ."
Frank Churchill	Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed . He was very much pleased with Randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to Highbury , Highbury itself , Hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one 's _ own _ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it . That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma 's brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a
Frank Churchill	His manner had no air of study or exaggeration .
Frank Churchill	He did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment .
Frank Churchill	"On his side were the inquiries,--""Was she a horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?-- Pleasant walks?--Had they a large neighbourhood?--Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough?--There"
Frank Churchill	""" But when satisfied on all these points , and their acquaintance proportionably advanced , he contrived to find an opportunity , while their two fathers were engaged with each other , of introducing his mother - in - law , and speaking of her with so much handsome praise , so much warm admiration , so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father , and her very kind reception of himself , as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please-- and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her ."
Frank Churchill	He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter .
Frank Churchill	He understood what would be welcome ; he could be sure of little else .
Frank Churchill	""" His father 's marriage , "" he said , "" had been the wisest measure , every friend must rejoice in it ; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him ."
Frank Churchill	He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor 's merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse 's character , than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor 's .
Frank Churchill	And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person .
Frank Churchill	""" Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for , "" said he ; "" but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston . """
Frank Churchill	""" You can not see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings , "" said Emma ; "" were you to guess her to be _ eighteen _ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _ she _ would be ready to quarrel with you for using"
Frank Churchill	"Do n't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman . "" "" I hope I should know better , "" he replied ; "" no , depend upon it , ( with a gallant bow , ) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms . """
Frank Churchill	Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance .
Frank Churchill	She must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable .
Frank Churchill	"He could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill 's accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night . A reasonable visit paid , Mr. Weston began to move.--""He must be going"
Frank Churchill	"He had business at the Crown about his hay , and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford 's , but he need not hurry any body else . """
Frank Churchill	"His son , too well bred to hear the hint , rose immediately also , saying , "" As you are going farther on business , sir , I will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now . I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma , ) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax . I shall have no difficulty , I suppose , in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I believe , is not the proper name -- I should rather say Barnes , or Bates ."
Frank Churchill	Do you know any family of that name ?
Frank Churchill	""" To be sure we do , "" cried his father ; "" Mrs. Bates -- we passed her house-- I saw Miss Bates at the window ."
Frank Churchill	True , true , you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax ; I remember you knew her at Weymouth , and a fine girl she is .
Frank Churchill	""" "" There is no necessity for my calling this morning , "" said the young man ; "" another day would do as well ; but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which-- "" "" Oh !"
Frank Churchill	What is right to be done can not be done too soon . And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her _ here _ should be carefully avoided .
Frank Churchill	You saw her with the Campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on .
Frank Churchill	"If you do not call early it will be a slight . "" The son looked convinced ."
Frank Churchill	""" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance , "" said Emma ; "" she is a very elegant young woman . "" He agreed to it , but with so quiet a "" Yes , "" as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it ."
Frank Churchill	""" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before , "" said she , "" I think you will to - day ."
Frank Churchill	You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue .
Frank Churchill	""" "" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ? "" said Mr. Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; "" then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady ."
Frank Churchill	She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life . They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way .
Frank Churchill	""" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me . "" "" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . """
Frank Churchill	"Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it , looking as serious as he could , and his father gave his hearty support by calling out , "" My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs. Bates 's , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump . """
Frank Churchill	"He could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill 's accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night . A reasonable visit paid , Mr. Weston began to move.--""He must be going"
Frank Churchill	"She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words "" my son , "" and "" Frank , "" and "" my son , "" repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward ."
Frank Churchill	Now , it so happened that in spite of Emma 's resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill , which always interested her .
Frank Churchill	She had frequently thought -- especially since his father 's marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _ were _ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition .
Frank Churchill	He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her . She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations . With such sensations , Mr. Elton 's civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--
Frank Churchill	I should like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend , Miss Smith , and my son -- and then I should say we were quite complete . I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting Frank .
Frank Churchill	"I had a letter from him this morning , and he will be with us within a fortnight . """
Frank Churchill	Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete .
Frank Churchill	""" He has been wanting to come to us , "" continued Mr. Weston , "" ever since September : every letter has been full of it ; but he can not command his own time ."
Frank Churchill	He has those to please who must be pleased , and who ( between ourselves ) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices .
Frank Churchill	But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January .
Frank Churchill	"and Mrs. Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him , that she must be almost as happy as yourself . "" "" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off ."
Frank Churchill	She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do .
Frank Churchill	There are secrets in all families , you know)--The case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January ; and that Frank 's coming depends upon their being put off . If they are not put off , he can not stir .
Frank Churchill	I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January , as I am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at Hartfield , that she can not calculate on their effects , as I have been long in the practice of doing .
Frank Churchill	If you think he will come , I shall think so too ; for you know Enscombe .
Frank Churchill	I never allow myself to speak ill of her , on Frank 's account ; for I do believe her to be very fond of him . I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body , except herself : but she has always been kind to him ( in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices , and expecting every thing to be as she likes ) .
Frank Churchill	And it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though I would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper .
Frank Churchill	""" Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs. Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy-- yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.-- Mrs. Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : "" for I can not depend upon his coming ."
Frank Churchill	"Then turning to Isabella , who had not been attending before--""You must know , my dear Mrs. Knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks . It depends entirely upon his aunt 's spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper ."
Frank Churchill	Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe , and is a very odd - tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends upon her being willing to spare him .
Frank Churchill	The Eltons walked together ; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill .
Frank Churchill	At first it was downright dulness to Emma . She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid .
Frank Churchill	He said nothing worth hearing-- looked without seeing -- admired without intelligence -- listened without knowing what she said .
Frank Churchill	While he was so dull , it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable .
Frank Churchill	When they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object .
Frank Churchill	To amuse her , and be agreeable in her eyes , seemed all that he cared for -- and Emma , glad to be enlivened , not sorry to be flattered , was gay and easy too , and gave him all the friendly encouragement , the admission to be gallant , which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance ; but which now , in her own estimation , meant nothing , though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe .
Frank Churchill	""" Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively . """
Frank Churchill	She laughed because she was disappointed ; and though she liked him for his attentions , and thought them all , whether in friendship , admiration , or playfulness , extremely judicious , they were not winning back her heart .
Frank Churchill	She still intended him for her friend .
Frank Churchill	""" How much I am obliged to you , "" said he , "" for telling me to come to - day!-- If it had not been for you , I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party ."
Frank Churchill	I had quite determined to go away again .
Frank Churchill	""" Yes , you were very cross ; and I do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries ."
Frank Churchill	I was a kinder friend than you deserved .
Frank Churchill	But you were humble .
Frank Churchill	You begged hard to be commanded to come .
Frank Churchill	""" Do n't say I was cross ."
Frank Churchill	I was fatigued .
Frank Churchill	The heat overcame me .
Frank Churchill	""" "" It is hotter to - day . "" "" Not to my feelings ."
Frank Churchill	"I am perfectly comfortable to - day . "" "" You are comfortable because you are under command . "" "" Your command?--Yes . "" "" Perhaps I intended you to say so , but I meant self - command ."
Frank Churchill	You had ,
Frank Churchill	somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as I can not be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine .
Frank Churchill	I can have no self - command without a motive .
Frank Churchill	You order me , whether you speak or not .
Frank Churchill	And you can be always with me .
Frank Churchill	"You are always with me . "" "" Dating from three o'clock yesterday ."
Frank Churchill	"My perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before . "" "" Three o'clock yesterday !"
Frank Churchill	That is your date .
Frank Churchill	"I thought I had seen you first in February . "" "" Your gallantry is really unanswerable ."
Frank Churchill	""" "" I say nothing of which I am ashamed , "" replied he , with lively impudence ."
Frank Churchill	""" I saw you first in February ."
Frank Churchill	Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can .
Frank Churchill	Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side , and Dorking on the other .
Frank Churchill	"I saw you first in February . """
Frank Churchill	I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse ( who , wherever she is , presides ) to say , that she desires to know what you are all thinking of ?
Frank Churchill	Ladies and gentlemen -- I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way .
Frank Churchill	Here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already , ) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated -- or two things moderately clever-- or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all .
Frank Churchill	An abominable puppy!-- You know who I mean ( nodding to her husband ) .
Frank Churchill	Pass us , if you please , Mr. Churchill .
Frank Churchill	""" Happy couple ! "" said Frank Churchill , as soon as they were out of hearing:--""How well they suit one another!--Very lucky -- marrying as they did , upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only knew each other , I think , a few weeks in Bath !"
Frank Churchill	"Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen . "" You were speaking , "" said he , gravely ."
Frank Churchill	"He made no answer ; merely looked , and bowed in submission ; and soon afterwards said , in a lively tone , "" Well , I have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever I marry , I hope some body will chuse my wife for me ."
Frank Churchill	( turning to Emma . ) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I
Frank Churchill	am sure I should like any body fixed on by you .
Frank Churchill	Find some body for me .
Frank Churchill	I am in no hurry .
Frank Churchill	I care for nothing else .
Frank Churchill	I shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when I return , I shall come to you for my wife .
Frank Churchill	""" Now , ma'am , "" said Jane to her aunt , "" shall we join Mrs. Elton ? "" "" If you please , my dear ."
Frank Churchill	With all my heart .
Frank Churchill	I am quite ready .
Frank Churchill	I was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well .
Frank Churchill	"That 's one of the ladies in the Irish car party , not at all like her.-- Well , I declare-- "" They walked off , followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley ."
Frank Churchill	"I dare say she did not understand me . "" "" I assure you she did ."
Frank Churchill	I wish you could have heard how she talked of it-- with what candour and generosity .
Frank Churchill	I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome .
Frank Churchill	""" They are blended , "" said he , "" I acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good ."
Frank Churchill	Were she a woman of fortune , I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner .
Frank Churchill	"You , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _ some _ , ) would be entirely guided by _ your _ treatment of her.--This is not pleasant to you , Emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but I must , I will,--I will tell you truths while I can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now . """
Frank Churchill	While they talked , they were advancing towards the carriage ; it was ready ; and , before she could speak again , he had handed her in .
Frank Churchill	He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted , and her tongue motionless .
Frank Churchill	He had turned away , and the horses were in motion .
Frank Churchill	The day approached , the day arrived ; and after a morning of some anxious watching , Frank Churchill , in all the certainty of his own self , reached Randalls before dinner , and every thing was safe .
Frank Churchill	No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma .
Frank Churchill	Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man 's company . She was to convey Harriet , and they drove to the Crown in good time , the Randalls party just sufficiently before them .
Frank Churchill	Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch ; and though he did not say much , his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening .
Frank Churchill	Frank was standing by her , but not steadily ; there was a restlessness , which shewed a mind not at ease . He was looking about , he was going to the door , he was watching for the sound of other carriages,-- impatient to begin , or afraid of being always near her .
Frank Churchill	""" I think she must be here soon , "" said he ."
Frank Churchill	""" I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton , I have heard so much of her ."
Frank Churchill	"It can not be long , I think , before she comes . """
Frank Churchill	"He was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said , "" I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her ."
Frank Churchill	Emma longed to know what Frank 's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be ; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress , and her smiles of graciousness . He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion , by giving her very proper attention , after the introduction had passed .
Frank Churchill	"In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.-- "" I will see that there are umbrellas , sir , "" said Frank to his father : "" Miss Bates must not be forgotten : "" and away he went ."
Frank Churchill	Mr. Weston was following ; but Mrs. Elton detained him , to gratify him by her opinion of his son ; and so briskly did she begin , that the young man himself , though by no means moving slowly , could hardly be out of hearing .
Frank Churchill	My dear Jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two , but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely-- and there was a mat to step upon -- I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh !
Frank Churchill	Mr. Frank Churchill , I must tell you my mother 's spectacles have never been in fault since ; the rivet never came out again .
Frank Churchill	My mother often talks of your good - nature .
Frank Churchill	Does not she , Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?-- Ah !
Frank Churchill	No coffee , I thank you , for me -- never take coffee.--A little tea if you please , sir , by and bye,--no hurry -- Oh !
Frank Churchill	Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma ; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her.--He was thoughtful .
Frank Churchill	Whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine .
Frank Churchill	So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand.--We shall see if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill .
Frank Churchill	I like him very well .
Frank Churchill	""" At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously , that Emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises , and did not want to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while , till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton 's tones again distinctly forward.--Mr . Elton had just joined them , and his wife was exclaiming , "" Oh ! you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion?-- I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us ."
Frank Churchill	""" Jane!""--repeated Frank Churchill , with a look of surprize and displeasure.-- "" That is easy -- but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose . """
Frank Churchill	""" Ungrateful!--What do you mean ? """
Frank Churchill	""" She will think Frank ought to ask her . """
Frank Churchill	Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of --
Frank Churchill	and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _ him _ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon.-- Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way , Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed . Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .
Frank Churchill	Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change .
Frank Churchill	She wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like Frank Churchill better.-- He seemed often observing her . She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .
Frank Churchill	They seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers . That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done , was indubitable .
Frank Churchill	Mr. Churchill , oh !
Frank Churchill	you are too obliging !
Frank Churchill	How well you put it on!--so gratified !
Frank Churchill	do you recommend this side?--Well , I am sure , Mr. Churchill-- only it seems too good -- but just as you please .
Frank Churchill	What you direct in this house can not be wrong .
Frank Churchill	A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill .
Frank Churchill	She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him . Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of;-- but if he , who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two , were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away , it would be very distressing .
Frank Churchill	If a separation of two months should not have cooled him , there were dangers and evils before her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary .
Frank Churchill	She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again , and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his .
Frank Churchill	She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration .
Frank Churchill	It was not very long , though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen , before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill 's feelings .
Frank Churchill	The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined , but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards .
Frank Churchill	He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act .
Frank Churchill	There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her .
Frank Churchill	But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done , of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree .
Frank Churchill	She watched him well .
Frank Churchill	It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been .
Frank Churchill	He was in high spirits ; as ready to talk and laugh as ever , and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit , and recur to old stories : and he was not without agitation .
Frank Churchill	It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference .
Frank Churchill	He was not calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was restlessness about him .
Frank Churchill	Lively as he was , it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but what decided her belief on the subject , was his staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury .
Frank Churchill	""" He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed-- he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word -- but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry off . """
Frank Churchill	She had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long .
Frank Churchill	This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days .
Frank Churchill	He was often hoping , intending to come -- but was always prevented .
Frank Churchill	His aunt could not bear to have him leave her .
Frank Churchill	Such was his own account at Randall 's .
Frank Churchill	If he were quite sincere , if he really tried to come , it was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill 's removal to London had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder .
Frank Churchill	That she was really ill was very certain ; he had declared himself convinced of it , at Randalls . Though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago . He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove , or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her ; but he could not be prevailed on , by all his father 's doubts , to say that her complaints were merely imaginary , or that she was as strong as ever .
Frank Churchill	Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement , and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends-- for the house was taken for May and June . She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish . Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects .
Frank Churchill	He was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered .
Frank Churchill	She hoped it was not so . Two months must bring it to the proof . Mr. Weston 's own happiness was indisputable .
Frank Churchill	He was quite delighted .
Frank Churchill	It was the very circumstance he could have wished for .
Frank Churchill	Now , it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood .
Frank Churchill	What were nine miles to a young man?--An hour 's ride .
Frank Churchill	He would be always coming over .
Frank Churchill	The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never .
Frank Churchill	Sixteen miles -- nay , eighteen -- it must be full eighteen to Manchester - street -- was a serious obstacle . Were he ever able to get away , the day would be spent in coming and returning .
Frank Churchill	There was no comfort in having him in London ; he might as well be at Enscombe ; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse . Better than nearer !
Frank Churchill	Now , however , it was absolutely to be ; every preparation was resumed , and very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond , a few lines from Frank , to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change , and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty - four hours at any given time , induced them to name as early a day as possible .
Frank Churchill	Mr. Weston 's ball was to be a real thing .
Frank Churchill	Mrs. Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield , James had due notice , and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with them , while dear Emma were gone .
Frank Churchill	""" You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume , "" he continued-- """
Frank Churchill	and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name .
Frank Churchill	""" Oh ! yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance . I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage ."
Frank Churchill	""" "" You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy , I am sure.-- He is to be in town next week , if not sooner ."
Frank Churchill	I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son 's hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to Mrs. Weston .
Frank Churchill	She is his principal correspondent , I assure you .
Frank Churchill	In Frank 's last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle 's !
Frank Churchill	Frank writes word .
Frank Churchill	She is very fond of Frank , and therefore I would not speak ill of her . Besides , she is out of health now ; but _ that _ indeed , by her own account , she has always been .
Frank Churchill	""" Frank was here in February for a fortnight . "" "" So I remember to have heard ."
Frank Churchill	He will find an _ addition _ to the society of Highbury when he comes again ; that is , if I may presume to call myself an addition .
Frank Churchill	But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world .
Frank Churchill	He had done his duty and could return to his son .
Frank Churchill	""" When Frank left us , "" continued he , "" it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day 's news doubly welcome ."
Frank Churchill	It has been completely unexpected . That is , _ I _ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure
Frank Churchill	something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me . He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding . ` How could he contrive to come ?
Frank Churchill	And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ? ' and so forth -- I always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see .
Frank Churchill	May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is ordered , or has ordered herself , to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe -- in short , to spend in London ; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring-- precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it : days almost at the longest ; weather genial and pleasant , always inviting one out , and never too hot for exercise
Frank Churchill	When he was here before , we made the best of it ; but there was a good deal of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always is in February , you know , and we could not do half that we intended . Now will be the time .
Frank Churchill	This will be complete enjoyment ; and I do not know , Mrs. Elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house . I think it is so .
Frank Churchill	I hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy .
Frank Churchill	He is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy .
Frank Churchill	Mrs. Weston 's partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me .
Frank Churchill	"She thinks nobody equal to him . "" "" And I assure you , Mr. Weston , I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour ."
Frank Churchill	I have heard so much in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe , that I am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others .
Frank Churchill	I give you notice that as I find your son , so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer .
Frank Churchill	Frank 's mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her .
Frank Churchill	The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother 's ; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton 's activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will . Mr. Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more . He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma .
Frank Churchill	From Frank Churchill 's face , where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away , he had involuntarily turned to hers ; but she was indeed behind , and too busy with her shawl .
Frank Churchill	suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye-- he seemed watching her intently -- in vain , however , if it were so-- Jane passed between them into the hall , and looked at neither
Frank Churchill	""" Miss Woodhouse , "" said Frank Churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , "" have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ? It used to stand here ."
Frank Churchill	"I want to puzzle you again . "" Emma was pleased with the thought ; and producing the box , the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets , which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves ."
Frank Churchill	"The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the "" poor little boys , "" or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it . Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax ."
Frank Churchill	It was a child 's play , chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill 's part .
Frank Churchill	With great indignation did he continue to observe him ; with great alarm and distrust , to observe also his two blinded companions .
Frank Churchill	"He heard Frank Churchill next say , with a glance towards Jane , "" I will give it to her -- shall I?""--and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth . "" No , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed . "" It was done however ."
Frank Churchill	This gallant young man , who seemed to love without feeling , and to recommend himself without complaisance , directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax , and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it .
Frank Churchill	She was immediately up , and wanting to quit the table ; but so many were also moving , that she could not get away ; and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept away by her unexamined . She was afterwards looking for her shawl -- Frank Churchill was looking also -- it was growing dusk , and the room was in confusion ; and how they parted , Mr. Knightley could not tell .
Frank Churchill	""" she cried in evident embarrassment , "" it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves . "" "" The joke , "" he replied gravely , "" seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill . "" He had hoped she would speak again , but she did not ."
Frank Churchill	The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day ; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity . She must have delighted the Coles -- worthy people , who deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind her that would not soon die away . Perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy . She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax 's feelings to Frank Churchill .
Frank Churchill	his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue .
Frank Churchill	""" And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope , "" said Frank Churchill , "" to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield-- if you are going home ."
Frank Churchill	Mr. Cole said how much taste you had ; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution .
Frank Churchill	So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill !
Frank Churchill	` Oh ! ' said he , ` I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively . ' --Which you know shewed him to be so very . . . .
Frank Churchill	Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing .
Frank Churchill	He seems every thing the fondest parent could . . . .
Frank Churchill	She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of ; and , for his sake , greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston ; she was very often thinking of him , and quite impatient for a letter , that she might know how he was , how were his spirits , how was his aunt , and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring . But , on the other hand , she could not admit herself to be unhappy , nor , after the first morning , to be less disposed for employment than usual ; she was still busy and cheerful ; and , pleasing as he was , she could yet imagine him to have faults ; and farther , though thinking of him so much , and , as she sat drawing or working , forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment , fancying interesting dialogues , and inventing elegant letters ; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _ refused _ _ him _ .
Frank Churchill	I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness .
Frank Churchill	""" Upon the whole , she was equally contented with her view of his feelings . """
Frank Churchill	_ He _ is undoubtedly very much in love -- every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed!--and when he comes again , if his affection continue , I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up . Not
Frank Churchill	imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto
Frank Churchill	No , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched .
Frank Churchill	Could he have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at parting would have been different.-- Still , however , I must be on my guard .
Frank Churchill	"This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but I do not know that I expect it will ; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man-- I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.-- His feelings are warm , but I can imagine them rather changeable.-- Every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well again after a little while -- and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and I shall have been let off easily . """
Frank Churchill	When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived , Emma had the perusal of it ; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations , and think she had undervalued their strength .
Frank Churchill	It was a long , well - written letter , giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings , expressing all the affection , gratitude , and respect which was natural and honourable , and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive , with spirit and precision .
Frank Churchill	His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated ; Mrs. Churchill was recovering , and he dared not yet , even in his own imagination , fix a time for coming to Randalls again . Gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part , its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to Mrs. Weston , that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer , and that he must learn to do without her . Her intentions were unchanged .
Frank Churchill	Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness .
Frank Churchill	"His recollection of Harriet , and the words which clothed it , the "" beautiful little friend , "" suggested to her the idea of Harriet 's succeeding her in his affections ."
Frank Churchill	Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding ; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner ; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For Harriet , it would be advantageous and delightful indeed .
Frank Churchill	""" It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet 's behalf , though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom ; for evil in that quarter was at hand . As Frank Churchill 's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton 's engagement in the conversation of Highbury , as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first , so now upon Frank Churchill 's disappearance , Mr. Elton 's concerns were assuming the most irresistible form.--His"
Frank Churchill	He would soon be among them again ; Mr. Elton and his bride .
Frank Churchill	"There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before "" Mr. Elton and his bride "" was in every body 's mouth , and Frank Churchill was forgotten . Emma grew sick at the sound ."
Frank Churchill	"Half a dozen natural children , perhaps -- and poor Frank cut off!-- This , though very undesirable , would be no matter of agony to her . It inspired little more than an animating curiosity . "" Who is that gentleman on horseback ? "" said she , as they proceeded-- speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view ."
Frank Churchill	""" I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank , I assure you ."
Frank Churchill	He is half way to Windsor by this time .
Frank Churchill	""" Has your son been with you , then ? "" "" Oh !"
Frank Churchill	"For a moment he was silent ; and then added , in a tone much more guarded and demure , "" Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did . """
Frank Churchill	""" "" Ah ! "" thought Emma , "" he would have done as much for Harriet . "" "" This was settled last night , and Frank was off with the light this morning ."
Frank Churchill	"and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him , for Frank , I mean , that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for-- and still am disposed to give her credit for , in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right . And how much may be said in her situation for even that error ! """
Frank Churchill	His air and voice recovered their usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand , and entered on the subject in a manner to prove , that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing . His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with Emma , in their walk back to Hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done .
Frank Churchill	He had not left her long , by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else , when a letter was brought her from Randalls -- a very thick letter;--she guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity of reading it.-- She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill ; she wanted no explanations , she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself-- and as for understanding any thing he wrote , she was sure she was incapable of it.--It must be waded through , however .
Frank Churchill	She opened the packet ; it was too surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself , ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston .
Frank Churchill	The event had every promise of happiness for her friend .
Frank Churchill	Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning 's work for her .
Frank Churchill	She recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood .
Frank Churchill	She had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day . It was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful . His spirits required support .
Frank Churchill	He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .
Frank Churchill	Matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter 's marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield .
Frank Churchill	"Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could , to keep him from such thoughts ; but when tea came , it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner , "" Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again ."
Frank Churchill	"Mr. Weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ? "" "" A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own ?"
Frank Churchill	"XI "" Harriet , poor Harriet!""--Those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her . Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself -- very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _ his _ behaviour as her _ own _ , which made her so angry with him ."
Frank Churchill	It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet 's account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet ! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery .
Frank Churchill	"Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , "" Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith . ""--She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet 's imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments ."
Frank Churchill	"Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet , that she must not allow herself to think of him , and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--""But , with common sense , "" she added , "" I am afraid I have had little to do . """
Frank Churchill	If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful.-- As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account .
Frank Churchill	"Mr. Churchill had made a point of it , as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost ; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum . ""--"
Frank Churchill	he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while .
Frank Churchill	Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly-- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr. Frank Churchill 's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax . You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly .
Frank Churchill	""" Why should you caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill . "" "" I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject , "" replied Emma , smiling ; "" but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ?"
Frank Churchill	I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other .
Frank Churchill	And that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing!--I am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him .
Frank Churchill	At first , if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened ; that there had been matches of greater disparity ( those were your very words);-- I should not have dared to give way to -- I should not have thought it possible --
Frank Churchill	I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , was spoken of .
Frank Churchill	I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The
Frank Churchill	It was not the gipsies -- it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant .
Frank Churchill	That was the kind action ; that was the noble benevolence and generosity ; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth .
Frank Churchill	But I hope , Miss Woodhouse , that supposing -- that if-- strange as it may appear-- . But you know they were your own words , that _ more _ wonderful things had happened , matches of _ greater _ disparity had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me ; and , therefore , it seems as if such a thing even as this , may have occurred before-- and
Frank Churchill	Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet 's having some hope of a return ?
Frank Churchill	; she compared the two -- compared them , as they had always stood in her estimation , from the time of the latter 's becoming known to her-- and as they must at any time have been compared by her , had it-- oh ! had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear . She saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all ! This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection .
Frank Churchill	Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became commonplace , threadbare , stale in the comparison , exciting no surprize , presenting no disparity , affording nothing to be said or thought.--Mr . Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an elevation on her side !
Frank Churchill	XII One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma -- its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill 's stay in Surry ; for , in spite of Mr. Weston 's confidence , she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight .
Frank Churchill	A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew 's instant return .
Frank Churchill	Mrs. Churchill was unwell-- far too unwell to do without him ; she had been in a very suffering state ( so said her husband ) when writing to her nephew two days before , though from her usual unwillingness to give pain , and constant habit of never thinking of herself , she had not mentioned it ; but now she was too ill to trifle , and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay .
Frank Churchill	As to his going , it was inevitable . He must be gone within a few hours , though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt , to lessen his repugnance . He knew her illnesses ; they never occurred but for her own convenience .
Frank Churchill	"Mrs. Weston added , "" that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon . "" This wretched note was the finale of Emma 's breakfast . When once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim . The loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man-- and all that the young man might be feeling!--It"
Frank Churchill	Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him .
Frank Churchill	He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it .
Frank Churchill	His dejection was most evident .
Frank Churchill	"He sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes ; and when rousing himself , it was only to say , "" Of all horrid things , leave - taking is the worst ."
Frank Churchill	""" "" But you will come again , "" said Emma ."
Frank Churchill	""" This will not be your only visit to Randalls . """
Frank Churchill	""" Ah!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able to return!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring -- but I am afraid -- they did not stir last spring-- I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever ."
Frank Churchill	that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the pleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation , foolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh !
Frank Churchill	""" "" If I can come again , we are still to have our ball ."
Frank Churchill	""" Such a fortnight as it has been ! "" he continued ; "" every day more precious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making me less fit to bear any other place ."
Frank Churchill	""" As you do us such ample justice now , "" said Emma , laughing , "" I will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ?"
Frank Churchill	Do not we rather surpass your expectations ?
Frank Churchill	"I am sure you did not much expect to like us . You would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury . """
Frank Churchill	He laughed rather consciously ; and though denying the sentiment , Emma was convinced that it had been so .
Frank Churchill	""" And you must be off this very morning ?"
Frank Churchill	""" Yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and I must be off immediately . I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him . "" "" Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates ?"
Frank Churchill	""" Yes -- I _ have _ called there ; passing the door , I thought it better ."
Frank Churchill	I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates 's being absent .
Frank Churchill	She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in . She is a woman that one may , that one _ must _ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight .
Frank Churchill	"It was better to pay my visit , then""-- He hesitated , got up , walked to a window ."
Frank Churchill	""" In short , "" said he , "" perhaps , Miss Woodhouse -- I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion""-- He looked at her , as if wanting to read her thoughts ."
Frank Churchill	"It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious , which she did not wish . Forcing herself to speak , therefore , in the hope of putting it by , she calmly said , "" You are quite in the right ; it was most natural to pay your visit , then""-- He was silent ."
Frank Churchill	She believed he was looking at her ; probably reflecting on what she had said , and trying to understand the manner .
Frank Churchill	She heard him sigh .
Frank Churchill	It was natural for him to feel that he had _ cause _ to sigh .
Frank Churchill	He could not believe her to be encouraging him .
Frank Churchill	"A few awkward moments passed , and he sat down again ; and in a more determined manner said , "" It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield ."
Frank Churchill	"My regard for Hartfield is most warm""-- He stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed.-- He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ?"
Frank Churchill	"Mr. Weston , always alert when business was to be done , and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable , as of foreseeing any that was doubtful , said , "" It was time to go ; "" and the young man , though he might and did sigh , could not but agree , to take leave . "" I shall hear about you all , "" said he ; "" that is my chief consolation . I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you ."
Frank Churchill	I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me . She has been so kind as to promise it .
Frank Churchill	the blessing of a female correspondent , when one is really interested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing .
Frank Churchill	"In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again . "" A very friendly shake of the hand , a very earnest "" Good - bye , "" closed the speech , and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill ."
Frank Churchill	They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen ; and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill .
Frank Churchill	In he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece , made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle , where sat Miss Woodhouse ; and till he could find a seat by her , would not sit at all .
Frank Churchill	"I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen . "" The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to Mr. Cole . When Mr. Cole had moved away , and her attention could be restored as before , she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax , who was sitting exactly opposite ."
Frank Churchill	He started .
Frank Churchill	""" Thank you for rousing me , "" he replied ."
Frank Churchill	""" I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that I can not keep my eyes from her ."
Frank Churchill	I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her own .
Frank Churchill	I see nobody else looking like her!-- I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion .
Frank Churchill	Shall I?--
Frank Churchill	"Yes , I will -- I declare I will -- and you shall see how she takes it;-- whether she colours . """
Frank Churchill	He was gone immediately ; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of Miss Fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing . Before he could return to his chair , it was taken by Mrs. Weston .
Frank Churchill	Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr. Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .
Frank Churchill	She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well . One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize -- a second , slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill . Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song , and every thing usual followed .
Frank Churchill	He was accused of having a delightful voice , and a perfect knowledge of music ; which was properly denied ; and that he knew nothing of the matter , and had no voice at all , roundly asserted .
Frank Churchill	Frank Churchill sang again .
Frank Churchill	""" That will do , "" said he , when it was finished , thinking aloud-- "" you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet . "" Another song , however , was soon begged for ."
Frank Churchill	"And Frank Churchill was heard to say , "" I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling ."
Frank Churchill	Mrs. Weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top .
Frank Churchill	"After some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston , look sorrowful , and have done . "" Perhaps it is as well , "" said Frank Churchill , as he attended Emma to her carriage ."
Frank Churchill	""" I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your 's ."
Mrs. Cole	I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it . I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to .
Mrs. Cole	But first of all , there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole .
Mrs. Cole	I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish .
Mrs. Cole	The charming Augusta Hawkins , in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands as would always be called ten ; a point of some dignity , as well as some convenience : the story told well ; he had not thrown himself away -- he had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity-- the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice ; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps so quick , from the accidental rencontre , to the dinner at Mr. Green 's , and the party at Mrs. Brown's -- smiles and blushes rising in importance-- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- had in short , to use a most intelligible phrase , been so very ready to have him , that vanity and prudence were equally contented .
Mrs. Cole	The wedding was no distant event , as the parties had only themselves to please , and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for ; and when he set out for Bath again , there was a general expectation , which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole 's did not seem to contradict , that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride .
Mrs. Cole	For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole 's note -- no , it can not be more than five-- or at least ten -- for I had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out -- I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork -- Jane was standing in the passage -- were not you , Jane?-- for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough . So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ` Shall I go down instead ?
Mrs. Cole	for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me .
Mrs. Cole	"A Miss Hawkins-- "" "" I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago ."
Mrs. Cole	He had just read Elton 's letter as I was shewn in , and handed it to me directly .
Mrs. Cole	"And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off . "" "" Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse , "" said Miss Bates , "" four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs. Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man -- but'--In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries ."
Mrs. Cole	I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole 's ; but I shall not stop three minutes :
Mrs. Cole	I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one ca n't tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole 's stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain .
Mrs. Cole	Till this year , every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey ; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea - bathing for the children , and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions , or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse , who could not be induced to get so far as London , even for poor Isabella 's sake ; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit . He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety .
Mrs. Cole	She could never see a fault in any of them .
Mrs. Bates	She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.-- How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates ! How directly , how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not
Mrs. Bates	In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet 's confidence . To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _ one _ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma 's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs. Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates 's , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates 's parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .
Mrs. Bates	After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates , and Mrs. Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .
Mrs. Bates	Mrs. Bates , the widow of a former vicar of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille . She lived with her single daughter in a very small way , and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady , under such untoward circumstances , can excite .
Mrs. Bates	Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married .
Mrs. Bates	The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard 's , or in London , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma 's sensations ; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself
Mrs. Bates	Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together .
Mrs. Bates	Miss Bates was out , which accounted for the previous tranquillity .
Mrs. Bates	"; it was being in Miss Fairfax 's confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people . Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady 's replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods , "" We can finish this some other time , you know ."
Mrs. Bates	You and I shall not want opportunities .
Mrs. Bates	I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology , and is not offended .
Mrs. Bates	"Let us be discreet-- quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines-- I forget the poem at this moment : "" For when a lady 's in the case , "" You know all other things give place . "" Now I say , my dear , in _ our _ case , for _ lady _ , read----mum ! a word to the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits , an't I ? But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My _ representation , you see , has quite appeased her ."
Mrs. Bates	""" And again , on Emma 's merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates 's knitting , she added , in a half whisper , "" I mentioned no _ names _ , you will observe.--Oh !"
Mrs. Bates	"Upon my word , Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!-- Oh ! if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst!""-- And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma , whispered farther , "" We do not say a word of any _ assistance _ that Perry might have ; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh ! no ; Perry shall have all the credit ."
Mrs. Bates	Things did not seem -- that is , there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least , but I might be mistaken .
Mrs. Bates	However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again .
Mrs. Bates	The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E. , he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;-- and his servants forgot it .
Mrs. Bates	Depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants , who are all , I have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration . And as for Mrs. Hodges , Wright holds her very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt , and never sent it .
Mrs. Bates	The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs. Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte . Busy as he was , however , the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again .
Mrs. Bates	I have the pleasure , madam , ( to Mrs. Bates , ) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present .
Mrs. Bates	""" But , in spite of all her friends ' urgency , and her own wish of seeing Ireland , Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates ? """
Mrs. Bates	I merely called , because I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates ; but I have been so pleasantly detained !
Mrs. Bates	Now , however , we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good morning .
Mrs. Bates	Jane Fairfax was an orphan , the only child of Mrs. Bates 's youngest daughter .
Mrs. Bates	The marriage of Lieut . Fairfax of the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ regiment of infantry , and Miss Jane Bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl .
Mrs. Bates	By birth she belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the fondling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations .
Mrs. Bates	The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane 's offences rose again .
Mrs. Bates	By birth she belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the fondling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations .
Mrs. Bates	It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell 's family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time .
Mrs. Bates	Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state .
Mrs. Bates	"and I always thought you meant it . "" He could say no more ; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates 's door ."
Mrs. Bates	""" I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are-- "" "" Very well , I am much obliged to you ."
Mrs. Bates	""" Emma would be "" very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates , & c. , "" and they did at last move out of the shop , with no farther delay from Miss Bates than , "" How do you do , Mrs. Ford ?"
Mrs. Bates	William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master 's profit than any thing ; but Mrs. Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being
Mrs. Bates	She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple - tart this spring .
Mrs. Bates	He told Patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for Mrs. Hodges _ would _ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed !
Mrs. Bates	Matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter 's marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield .
Mrs. Bates	"I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two . "" "" Especially when _ one _ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature ! "" said Emma playfully ."
Mrs. Bates	""" I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome . """
Mrs. Bates	You do not think I could mean _ you _ , or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean _ you _ .
Mrs. Bates	Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know-- in a joke -- it is all a joke .
Mrs. Bates	A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed , and then , about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage , an old and not very good house , almost as close to the road as it could be .
Mrs. Bates	"After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again-- "" I do so wonder , Miss Woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married ! so charming as you are!""-- Emma laughed , and replied , "" My being charming , Harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; I must find other people charming -- one other person at least ."
Mrs. Bates	This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute . They did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield . To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her . She gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child 's pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them .
Mrs. Bates	It could be protracted no longer . She was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance . The lovers were standing together at one of the windows . It had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully . But it would not do ; he had not come to the point . He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious .
Mr. Weston	In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet 's confidence . To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _ one _ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma 's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs. Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates 's , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates 's parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .
Mr. Weston	"Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement 's becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:-- but Mr. Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for "" such things , "" he observed , "" always got about . """
Mr. Weston	Emma smiled , and felt that Mr. Weston had very good reason for saying so .
Mr. Weston	Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston , must necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement .
Mr. Weston	In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings ; but one complete dinner engagement , and out of the house too , there was no avoiding , though at Christmas . Mr. Weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party .
Mr. Weston	Mr. Weston 's dining - room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , I would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two .
Mr. Weston	Concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to Hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt 's arms .
Mr. Weston	I hope you will think better of their looks to - morrow ; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case .
Mr. Weston	"I think Mr. John Knightley very far from looking well . "" "" What is the matter , sir?--Did you speak to me ? "" cried Mr. John Knightley , hearing his own name ."
Mr. Weston	I am sorry to find , my love , that my father does not think you looking well -- but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued .
Mr. Weston	"I could have wished , however , as you know , that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you left home . "" "" My dear Isabella,""--exclaimed he hastily--""pray do not concern yourself about my looks ."
Mr. Weston	""" I am most happy to hear it -- but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma 's age . """
Mr. Weston	"Mr. Churchill would never get over it . ""-- Even Mr. Weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said , "" Ah ! poor woman , who would have thought it ! "" and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense , true and steady ."
Mr. Weston	II Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property . He had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied .
Mr. Weston	Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend .
Mr. Weston	Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .
Mr. Weston	Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best .
Mr. Weston	She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother 's unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home . They lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston , and Miss Churchill of Enscombe .
Mr. Weston	Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .
Mr. Weston	From the expense of the child , however , he was soon relieved .
Mr. Weston	The boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother 's , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease .
Mr. Weston	Some scruples and some reluctance the widower - father may be supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome by other considerations , the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills , and he had only his own comfort to seek , and his own situation to improve as he could . A complete change of life became desirable . He quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in London , which afforded him a favourable opening . It was a concern which brought just employment enough . He had still a small house in Highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away .
Mr. Weston	He had , by that time , realised an easy competence -- enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury , which he had always longed for -- enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition .
Mr. Weston	It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .
Mr. Weston	He had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through . He had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well - judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it .
Mr. Weston	He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle 's heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age .
Mr. Weston	It was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father 's assistance .
Mr. Weston	His father had no apprehension of it .
Mr. Weston	The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr. Weston 's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear .
Mr. Weston	He saw his son every year in London , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too .
Mr. Weston	Mrs. Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma 's losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour 's ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr. Weston 's disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor , ' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .
Mr. Weston	"But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse 's giving a gentle sigh , and saying , "" Ah , poor Miss Taylor !"
Mr. Weston	She would be very glad to stay .
Mr. Weston	There was no recovering Miss Taylor -- nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse .
Mr. Weston	I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened .
Mr. Weston	He was the son of Mr. Weston -- he was continually here -- I always found him very pleasant -- and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered , and I allowed his attentions .
Mr. Weston	Emma had hardly expected them : for Mr. Weston , who had called in for half a minute , in order to hear that his son was very handsome , knew nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking up to the house together , arm in arm
Mr. Weston	"When Mr. Weston joined the party , however , and when the baby was fetched , there was no longer a want of subject or animation-- or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say , "" I have to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs. Weston 's letters . I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon . I hope you do not retract what you then said ."
Mr. Weston	Perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes
Mr. Weston	In the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings ' coming had been united , such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill , whose health seemed every day to supply a different report , and the situation of Mrs. Weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child , as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it .
Mr. Weston	That there was to be such a party had been long generally known : it had even given the idea of another . Emma had never been to Box Hill ; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing , and she and Mr. Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither .
Mr. Weston	This was so very well understood between them , that Emma could not but feel some surprise , and a little displeasure , on hearing from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton , as her brother and sister had failed her , that the two parties should unite , and go together ; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it , so it was to be , if she had no objection .
Mr. Weston	Now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton , of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton 's party !
Mr. Weston	"Every feeling was offended ; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston 's temper . """
Mr. Weston	"I am glad you approve of what I have done , "" said he very comfortably ."
Mr. Weston	""" But I thought you would . Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers . One can not have too large a party ."
Mr. Weston	It was now the middle of June , and the weather fine ; and Mrs. Elton was growing impatient to name the day , and settle with Mr. Weston as to pigeon - pies and cold lamb , when a lame carriage - horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty .
Mr. Weston	""" Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens ."
Mr. Weston	The invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like Mrs. Elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and Mr. Weston , unasked , promised to get Frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--
Mr. Weston	Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come . In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast , that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration ; and at last Donwell was settled for one day , and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing exactly right .
Mr. Weston	In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way .
Mr. Weston	Mrs. Weston looked , and looked in vain .
Mr. Weston	His father would not own himself uneasy , and laughed at her fears ; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare .
Mr. Weston	""" His aunt was so much better , that he had not a doubt of getting over to them . ""--Mrs . Churchill 's state , however , as many were ready to remind her , was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence -- and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe , or to say , that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming.--"
Mr. Weston	and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need . Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse 's entertainment .
Mr. Weston	Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him , and now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child , than in a total want of taste for what he saw , for he was slow , constant , and methodical.--Before this second looking over was begun
Mr. Weston	Mrs. Weston would be at ease .
Mr. Weston	The black mare was blameless ; _ they _ were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause .
Mr. Weston	He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her ; a nervous seizure , which had lasted some hours -- and he had quite given up every thought of coming , till very late;--and had he known how hot a ride he should have , and how late , with all his hurry , he must be , he believed he should not have come at all .
Mr. Weston	"Do you think it will look well ? "" The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing - room when Mr. Weston made his appearance among them . He had returned to a late dinner , and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over . He had been too much expected by the best judges , for surprize-- but there was great joy ."
Mr. Weston	Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , as he would have been sorry to see him before .
Mr. Weston	John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.--That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London ,
Mr. Weston	"John Knightley looked at him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and said , "" I could not have believed it even of _ him _ . "" Mr. Weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room . He gave her a letter , it was from Frank , and to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it . "" Read it , read it , "" said he , "" it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma . "" The two ladies looked over it together ; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time , in a voice a little subdued , but very audible to every body ."
Mr. Weston	Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think .
Mr. Weston	Well , what do you say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I?--Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me?--In town next week , you see -- at the latest , I dare say ; for _ she _ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or Saturday .
Mr. Weston	Mr. Weston , however , too eager to be very observant , too communicative to want others to talk , was very well satisfied with what she did say , and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already .
Mr. Weston	It was well that he took every body 's joy for granted , or he might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly delighted .
Mr. Weston	They were the first entitled , after Mrs. Weston and Emma , to be made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her .
Mr. Weston	Presently the carriage stopt ; she looked up ; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston , who were standing to speak to her .
Mr. Weston	"There was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for Mr. Weston immediately accosted her with , "" How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father-- glad to see him so well ."
Mr. Weston	Frank comes to - morrow -- I had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty-- he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so .
Mr. Weston	If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days ; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather .
Mr. Weston	There was no resisting such news , no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston 's , confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife , fewer and quieter , but not less to the purpose .
Mr. Weston	"Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated . "" I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield , "" said he , at the conclusion . Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife ."
Mr. Weston	""" We had better move on , Mr. Weston , "" said she , "" we are detaining the girls ."
Mr. Weston	""" Well , well , I am ready;""--and turning again to Emma , "" but you must not be expecting such a _ very _ fine young man ; you have only had _ my _ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:""-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction ."
Mr. Weston	""" Think of me to - morrow , my dear Emma , about four o'clock , "" was Mrs. Weston 's parting injunction ; spoken with some anxiety , and meant only for her ."
Mr. Weston	""" Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three , "" was Mr. Weston 's quick amendment ; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting ."
Mr. Weston	The morning of the interesting day arrived , and Mrs. Weston 's faithful pupil did not forget either at ten , or eleven , or twelve o'clock , that she was to think of her at four .
Mr. Weston	""" My dear , dear anxious friend,""--said she , in mental soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , "" always overcareful for every body 's comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right . """
Mr. Weston	She opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr. Weston and his son .
Mr. Weston	They had been arrived only a few minutes , and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank 's being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure .
Mr. Weston	""" I told you yesterday , "" cried Mr. Weston with exultation , "" I told you all that he would be here before the time named ."
Mr. Weston	I remembered what I used to do myself .
Mr. Weston	He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter .
Mr. Weston	""" Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for , "" said he ; "" but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston . """
Mr. Weston	""" You can not see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings , "" said Emma ; "" were you to guess her to be _ eighteen _ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _ she _ would be ready to quarrel with you for using"
Mr. Weston	"Do n't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman . "" "" I hope I should know better , "" he replied ; "" no , depend upon it , ( with a gallant bow , ) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms . """
Mr. Weston	She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about .
Mr. Weston	His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening .
Mr. Weston	"He could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill 's accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night . A reasonable visit paid , Mr. Weston began to move.--""He must be going"
Mr. Weston	"He had business at the Crown about his hay , and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford 's , but he need not hurry any body else . """
Mr. Weston	"His son , too well bred to hear the hint , rose immediately also , saying , "" As you are going farther on business , sir , I will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now . I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma , ) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax . I shall have no difficulty , I suppose , in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I believe , is not the proper name -- I should rather say Barnes , or Bates ."
Mr. Weston	""" To be sure we do , "" cried his father ; "" Mrs. Bates -- we passed her house-- I saw Miss Bates at the window ."
Mr. Weston	You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue .
Mr. Weston	""" "" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ? "" said Mr. Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; "" then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady ."
Mr. Weston	She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life . They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way .
Mr. Weston	""" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me . "" "" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . """
Mr. Weston	"Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it , looking as serious as he could , and his father gave his hearty support by calling out , "" My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs. Bates 's , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump . """
Mr. Weston	VII They had a very fine day for Box Hill ; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement , accommodation , and punctuality , were in favour of a pleasant party . Mr. Weston directed the whole , officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage , and every body was in good time .
Mr. Weston	Mrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse .
Mr. Weston	And Mr. Weston tried , in vain , to make them harmonise better . It seemed at first an accidental division , but it never materially varied .
Mr. Weston	Mr. and Mrs. Elton , indeed , shewed no unwillingness to mix , and be as agreeable as they could ; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill , there seemed a principle of separation , between the other parties , too strong for any fine prospects , or any cold collation , or any cheerful Mr. Weston , to remove .
Mr. Weston	""" "" I like your plan , "" cried Mr. Weston ."
Mr. Weston	I will do my best .
Mr. Weston	I am making a conundrum .
Mr. Weston	""" Low , I am afraid , sir , very low , "" answered his son;--""but we shall"
Mr. Weston	A conundrum of Mr. Weston 's shall clear him and his next neighbour .
Mr. Weston	Come , sir , pray let me hear it .
Mr. Weston	""" "" I doubt its being very clever myself , "" said Mr. Weston ."
Mr. Weston	You , ( to Emma ) , I am certain , will never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em - ma.--Do you understand ?
Mr. Weston	"Harriet.--It did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally ; some looked very stupid about it , and Mr. Knightley gravely said , "" This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else . _ Perfection _ should not have come quite so soon ."
Mr. Weston	You provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father ) .
Mr. Weston	""" Now , ma'am , "" said Jane to her aunt , "" shall we join Mrs. Elton ? "" "" If you please , my dear ."
Mr. Weston	I was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well .
Mr. Weston	We shall soon overtake her .
Mr. Weston	There she is -- no , that 's somebody else .
Mr. Weston	"That 's one of the ladies in the Irish car party , not at all like her.-- Well , I declare-- "" They walked off , followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley ."
Mr. Weston	Mr. Weston , his son , Emma , and Harriet , only remained ; and the young man 's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant .
Mr. Weston	Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment , and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others , or sitting almost alone , and quite unattended to , in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her . The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _ her _ carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure .
Mr. Weston	But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to . What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton ?
Mr. Weston	But Mr. Weston is almost an old man .
Mr. Weston	"Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty . "" "" Which makes his good manners the more valuable ."
Mr. Weston	Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at Mr. Weston 's time of life ?
Mr. Weston	"He will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss . "" "" Will he , indeed ?"
Mr. Weston	"Her next beginning was , "" In one respect , perhaps , Mr. Elton 's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley 's or Mr. Weston 's ."
Mr. Weston	There is an openness , a quickness , almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston , which every body likes in _ him _ , because there is so much good - humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied .
Mr. Weston	Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet 's head . She thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it . She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict .
Mr. Weston	Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man 's company . She was to convey Harriet , and they drove to the Crown in good time , the Randalls party just sufficiently before them .
Mr. Weston	""" So unreasonably early ! "" she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help Mr. Weston 's judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection ."
Mr. Weston	Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston depended , and felt , that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity .
Mr. Weston	She liked his open manners , but a little less of open - heartedness would have made him a higher character.--General benevolence , but not general friendship , made a man what he ought to be.-- She could fancy such a man . The whole party walked about , and looked , and praised again ; and then , having nothing else to do , formed a sort of half - circle round the fire , to observe in their various modes , till other subjects were started , that , though _ May _ , a fire in the evening was still very pleasant .
Mr. Weston	Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston 's fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger .
Mr. Weston	""" But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax ! "" said Mr. Weston , looking about ."
Mr. Weston	""" We thought you were to bring them . "" The mistake had been slight ."
Mr. Weston	"In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.-- "" I will see that there are umbrellas , sir , "" said Frank to his father : "" Miss Bates must not be forgotten : "" and away he went ."
Mr. Weston	Mr. Weston was following ; but Mrs. Elton detained him , to gratify him by her opinion of his son ; and so briskly did she begin , that the young man himself , though by no means moving slowly , could hardly be out of hearing .
Mr. Weston	""" A very fine young man indeed , Mr. Weston ."
Mr. Weston	You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him.--You
Mr. Weston	You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies-- quite a horror of them .
Mr. Weston	"Selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better . "" While she talked of his son , Mr. Weston 's attention was chained ; but when she got to Maple Grove , he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to , and with happy smiles must hurry away ."
Mr. Weston	Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston .
Mr. Weston	Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.-- What a pleasure it is to send one 's carriage for a friend!-- I understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary .
Mr. Weston	"You may be very sure I shall always take care of _ them _ . """
Mr. Weston	Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs. Weston 's to receive them .
Mr. Weston	Mr. Weston , you must really have had Aladdin 's lamp .
Mr. Weston	and I am sure our thanks are due to you , Mrs. Weston , on that score .
Mr. Weston	I said to my mother , ` Upon my word , ma'am-- . ' Thank you , my mother is remarkably well .
Mr. Weston	Bought at Weymouth , you know -- Mr. Dixon 's choice .
Mr. Weston	No coffee , I thank you , for me -- never take coffee.--A little tea if you please , sir , by and bye,--no hurry -- Oh !
Mr. Weston	"Then changing from a frown to a smile--""No , do not tell me -- I do not want to know what you mean.-- Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing ? """
Mr. Weston	and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _ him _ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon.-- Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way , Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed . Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .
Mr. Weston	Mr. Weston might be his son 's superior.-- In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.-- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley 's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself . His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body 's eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave .
Mr. Weston	She wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like Frank Churchill better.-- He seemed often observing her . She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .
Mr. Weston	She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife .
Mr. Weston	In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again .
Mr. Weston	His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced .
Mr. Weston	"Mr. Elton had retreated into the card - room , looking ( Emma trusted ) very foolish . She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her;--_she _ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner , "" Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very"
Mr. Weston	Grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ` Oh ! ' said I , ` I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr. Elton ,
Mr. Weston	My dear sir , you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am not helpless .
Mr. Weston	Sir , you are most kind .
Mr. Weston	Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked .
Mr. Weston	"He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton 's conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and Mrs. Elton 's looks also received the due share of censure . """
Mr. Weston	""" Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ? """
Mr. Weston	"He looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added , "" _ She _ ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be.--To that surmise"
Mr. Weston	"He shook his head ; but there was a smile of indulgence with it , and he only said , "" I shall not scold you ."
Mr. Weston	I leave you to your own reflections .
Mr. Weston	""" Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong ?"
Mr. Weston	""" Not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong , I am sure the other tells you of it . "" "" I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton ."
Mr. Weston	"It was through a series of strange blunders ! "" "" And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs. Elton is totally without ."
Mr. Weston	I found Harriet more conversable than I expected .
Mr. Weston	""" Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again ."
Mr. Weston	"She hesitated a moment , and then replied , "" With you , if you will ask me ."
Mr. Weston	""" Will you ? "" said he , offering his hand ."
Mr. Weston	""" Indeed I will ."
Mr. Weston	"XVIII "" I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you , "" said Mr. Weston ."
Mr. Weston	Mrs. Elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope , smiled most graciously .
Mr. Weston	""" You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume , "" he continued-- """
Mr. Weston	and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name .
Mr. Weston	""" Oh ! yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance . I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage ."
Mr. Weston	""" "" You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy , I am sure.-- He is to be in town next week , if not sooner ."
Mr. Weston	I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son 's hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to Mrs. Weston .
Mr. Weston	She is his principal correspondent , I assure you .
Mr. Weston	"I hardly ever get a letter . "" "" And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her !"
Mr. Weston	Mr. Weston-- ( laughing affectedly ) I must protest against that.--A most dangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.--Upon my word , if this is what I am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh !
Mr. Weston	"Mr. Weston , I could not have believed it of you ! """
Mr. Weston	"You must take care of yourself , Mrs. Elton.--This letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs. Churchill 's account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her-- so they are all to move southward without loss of time . "" "" Indeed!--from Yorkshire , I think ."
Mr. Weston	"a considerable journey . "" "" Yes , upon my word , very considerable ."
Mr. Weston	Sixty - five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London . But what is distance , Mr. Weston , to people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother , Mr. Suckling , sometimes flies about .
Mr. Weston	You will hardly believe me-- but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses .
Mr. Weston	""" The evil of the distance from Enscombe , "" said Mr. Weston , "" is , that Mrs. Churchill , _ as _ _ we _ _ understand _ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together ."
Mr. Weston	This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.--So
Mr. Weston	Certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs. Elton .
Mr. Weston	"You must grant me that . "" """
Mr. Weston	No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing .
Mr. Weston	I Always take the part of my own sex .
Mr. Weston	I do indeed .
Mr. Weston	I give you notice -- You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point . I always stand up for women-- and I assure you , if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill 's making incredible exertions to avoid it .
Mr. Weston	Selina says it is quite horror to her -- and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety .
Mr. Weston	"Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for""-- Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with , "" Oh ! Mr. Weston , do not mistake me ."
Mr. Weston	Selina is no fine lady , I assure you .
Mr. Weston	"Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld . "" Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly ."
Mr. Weston	It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _ not _ a fine lady ; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract , when Mr. Weston went on .
Mr. Weston	""" Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces , as you may suspect-- but this is quite between ourselves ."
Mr. Weston	She is very fond of Frank , and therefore I would not speak ill of her . Besides , she is out of health now ; but _ that _ indeed , by her own account , she has always been .
Mr. Weston	"I would not say so to every body , Mrs. Elton , but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill 's illness . "" "" If she is really ill , why not go to Bath , Mr. Weston?--To Bath , or to Clifton ? """
Mr. Weston	The fact is , I suppose , that she is tired of Enscombe .
Mr. Weston	"A fine place , but very retired . "" "" Aye -- like Maple Grove , I dare say ."
Mr. Weston	You seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement.-- And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion .
Mr. Weston	"I always say a woman can not have too many resources -- and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society . """
Mr. Weston	""" Frank was here in February for a fortnight . "" "" So I remember to have heard ."
Mr. Weston	He will find an _ addition _ to the society of Highbury when he comes again ; that is , if I may presume to call myself an addition .
Mr. Weston	"This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by , and Mr. Weston , with a very good grace , immediately exclaimed , "" My dear madam !"
Mr. Weston	Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible .
Mr. Weston	"Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston 's letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton . """
Mr. Weston	He had done his duty and could return to his son .
Mr. Weston	""" When Frank left us , "" continued he , "" it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day 's news doubly welcome ."
Mr. Weston	It has been completely unexpected . That is , _ I _ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure
Mr. Weston	something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me . He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding . ` How could he contrive to come ?
Mr. Weston	And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ? ' and so forth -- I always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see .
Mr. Weston	"I have observed , Mrs. Elton , in the course of my life , that if things are going untowardly one month , they are sure to mend the next . "" "" Very true , Mr. Weston , perfectly true . It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _ May _ before Hymen 's saffron robe would be put on for us . Oh !"
Mr. Weston	the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views !
Mr. Weston	The carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair .
Mr. Weston	She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and Mr. Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on .
Mr. Weston	""" You were mentioning May ."
Mr. Weston	When he was here before , we made the best of it ; but there was a good deal of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always is in February , you know , and we could not do half that we intended . Now will be the time .
Mr. Weston	This will be complete enjoyment ; and I do not know , Mrs. Elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house . I think it is so .
Mr. Weston	I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight .
Mr. Weston	I hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy .
Mr. Weston	Mrs. Weston 's partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me .
Mr. Weston	"She thinks nobody equal to him . "" "" And I assure you , Mr. Weston , I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour ."
Mr. Weston	I have heard so much in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe , that I am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others .
Mr. Weston	I give you notice that as I find your son , so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer .
Mr. Weston	""" Mr. Weston was musing ."
Mr. Weston	""" I hope , "" said he presently , "" I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill ."
Mr. Weston	If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish .
Mr. Weston	You can not be ignorant , Mrs. Elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment I have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her .
Mr. Weston	Mr. Churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife 's : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence !
Mr. Weston	"And what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood . She was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out - Churchill'd them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , I assure you , she is an upstart . "" "" Only think !"
Mr. Weston	I have quite a horror of upstarts .
Mr. Weston	Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort ; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves !
Mr. Weston	Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them directly .
Mr. Weston	A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall ; and how they got their fortune nobody knows . They came from Birmingham , which is not a place to promise much , you know , Mr. Weston .
Mr. Weston	"One has not great hopes from Birmingham . I always say there is something direful in the sound : but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans , though a good many things I assure you are suspected ; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother , Mr. Suckling , who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours . It is infinitely too bad . Mr. Suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove , and whose father had it before him -- I believe , at least -- I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before his death . "" They were interrupted ."
Mr. Weston	Tea was carrying round , and Mr. Weston , having said all that he wanted , soon took the opportunity of walking away .
Mr. Weston	After tea , Mr. and Mrs. Weston , and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse to cards .
Mr. Weston	The remaining five were left to their own powers , and Emma doubted their getting on very well ; for Mr. Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation ; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice , which nobody had inclination to pay , and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent .
Mr. Weston	"Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother . He was to leave them early the next day ; and he soon began with-- "" Well , Emma , I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister 's letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure . My charge would be much more concise than her 's , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them . "" "" I rather hope to satisfy you both , "" said Emma , "" for I shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for Isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic . "" "" And if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again ."
Mr. Weston	""" "" I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father-- or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately . """
Mr. Weston	Witness this very time . Here am I come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party!-- When did it happen before , or any thing like it ? Your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it .
Mr. Weston	""" "" Yes , "" said his brother quickly , "" it is Randalls that does it all . "" "" Very well -- and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way ."
Mr. Weston	And if they are , I only beg you to send them home .
Mr. Weston	""" No , "" cried Mr. Knightley , "" that need not be the consequence ."
Mr. Weston	I shall certainly be at leisure .
Mr. Weston	""" "" Upon my word , "" exclaimed Emma , "" you amuse me !"
Mr. Weston	I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys .
Mr. Weston	Dining once with the Coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place . I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed .
Mr. Weston	"But you , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) who know how very , very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , I can not imagine . And as to my dear little boys , I must say , that if Aunt Emma has not time for them , I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley , who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one-- and who , when he is at home , is either reading to himself or settling his accounts . """
Mr. Weston	Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile ; and succeeded without difficulty , upon Mrs. Elton 's beginning to talk to him .
Mr. Weston	"X One morning , about ten days after Mrs. Churchill 's decease , Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston , who "" could not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak with her . ""-- He met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father , "" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do , if it be possible . Mrs. Weston wants to see you ."
Mr. Weston	"But what can be the matter?-- Is she really not ill ? "" "" Depend upon me -- but ask no more questions ."
Mr. Weston	Something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls .
Mr. Weston	""" Now,""--said Emma , when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,-- "" now Mr. Weston , do let me know what has happened ."
Mr. Weston	""" No , no,""--he gravely replied.--""Don't ask me ."
Mr. Weston	I promised my wife to leave it all to her .
Mr. Weston	She will break it to you better than I can .
Mr. Weston	Tell me , I charge you tell me this moment what it is .
Mr. Weston	""" No , indeed you are mistaken ."
Mr. Weston	"""-- "" Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square ."
Mr. Weston	"I charge you by all that is sacred , not to attempt concealment . "" "" Upon my word , Emma . ""-- "" Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour , that it has nothing to do with any of them ?"
Mr. Weston	Good Heavens!--What can be to be _ broke _ to me , that does not relate to one of that family ?
Mr. Weston	""" Upon my honour , "" said he very seriously , "" it does not ."
Mr. Weston	""" I was wrong , "" he continued , "" in talking of its being _ broke _ to you ."
Mr. Weston	I should not have used the expression .
Mr. Weston	In fact , it does not concern you-- it concerns only myself,--that is , we hope.--Humph!--In short
Mr. Weston	, my dear Emma , there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it .
Mr. Weston	"I do n't say that it is not a disagreeable business -- but things might be much worse.--If we walk fast , we shall soon be at Randalls . """
Mr. Weston	"Half a dozen natural children , perhaps -- and poor Frank cut off!-- This , though very undesirable , would be no matter of agony to her . It inspired little more than an animating curiosity . "" Who is that gentleman on horseback ? "" said she , as they proceeded-- speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view ."
Mr. Weston	""" I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank , I assure you ."
Mr. Weston	""" Has your son been with you , then ? "" "" Oh !"
Mr. Weston	"For a moment he was silent ; and then added , in a tone much more guarded and demure , "" Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did . """
Mr. Weston	"They hurried on , and were speedily at Randalls.--""Well , my dear , "" said he , as they entered the room--""I have brought her , and now I hope you will soon be better ."
Mr. Weston	I shall leave you together .
Mr. Weston	"I shall not be far off , if you want me . ""-- And Emma distinctly heard him add , in a lower tone , before he quitted the room,--""I have been as good as my word . She has not the least idea . """
Mr. Weston	""" Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself"
Mr. Weston	I must love him ; and now that I am satisfied on one point , the one material point , I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may . They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment .
Mr. Weston	But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax , I never could , under any blunder , have spoken ill of her ; and as to speaking ill of him , there I must have been safe .
Mr. Weston	At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch .
Mr. Weston	"His wife gave him a look which invited him in ; and , while he was coming round , added , "" Now , dearest Emma , let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease , and incline him to be satisfied with the match . Let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may"
Mr. Weston	""" She met Mr. Weston on his entrance , with a smiling countenance , exclaiming , "" A very pretty trick you have been playing me , upon my word !"
Mr. Weston	But you really frightened me .
Mr. Weston	I thought you had lost half your property , at least .
Mr. Weston	"And here , instead of its being a matter of condolence , it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I congratulate you , Mr. Weston , with all my heart , on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter . """
Mr. Weston	A glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate .
Mr. Weston	There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else . Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first . Considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet 's mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would.-- She must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible . An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston 's parting words .
Mr. Weston	In spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet , which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself .
Mr. Weston	The intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another . Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet 's footstep and voice ; so , she supposed , had poor Mrs. Weston felt when _ she _ was approaching Randalls .
Mr. Weston	Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for Mr. Weston has told me himself .
Mr. Weston	I met him just now .
Mr. Weston	He told me it was to be a great secret ; and , therefore , I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you , but he said you knew it .
Mr. Weston	""" "" What did Mr. Weston tell you?""--said Emma , still perplexed ."
Mr. Weston	he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while .
Mr. Weston	""" Had you any idea , "" cried Harriet , "" of his being in love with her?--You , perhaps , might.--You ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body 's heart ; but nobody else--"
Mr. Weston	Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly-- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr. Frank Churchill 's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax . You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly .
Mr. Weston	""" Him!--never , never ."
Mr. Weston	"Dear Miss Woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ? "" turning away distressed ."
Mr. Weston	"Harriet , who was standing at some distance , and with face turned from her , did not immediately say any thing ; and when she did speak , it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma 's . "" I should not have thought it possible , "" she began , "" that you could have misunderstood me ! I know we agreed never to name him-- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else , I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person . Mr. Frank Churchill , indeed !"
Mr. Weston	"But if _ you _ , who had been always acquainted with him-- "" "" Harriet ! "" cried Emma , collecting herself resolutely--""Let us understand each other now , without the possibility of farther mistake ."
Mr. Weston	I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The
Mr. Weston	""" Might he not?--Is not it possible , that when enquiring , as you thought , into the state of your affections , he might be alluding to Mr. Martin-- he might have Mr. Martin 's interest in view ?"
Mr. Weston	You told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine -- and so I have .
Mr. Weston	"But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . "" The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech , the many bitter feelings , made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma 's side , to enable her to say on reply , "" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . "" Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father 's footsteps . He was coming through the hall . Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him ."
Mr. Weston	Had she left her where she ought , and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not , with a folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong-- all would have been safe ; none of this dreadful sequel would have been .
Mr. Weston	I could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room , and I could get at him , I spoke to him about the carriage .
Mr. Weston	You may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , I made my way directly to Miss Bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once .
Philip Elton	Not unfrequently , through Emma 's persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card - table for him . Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; and by Mr. Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse 's drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away .
Philip Elton	Harriet , Mr. Elton , and Mr. Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr. Woodhouse 's habits and inclination being consulted in every thing .
Philip Elton	Emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in Mrs. Goddard 's unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton 's would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much . She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard 's door , when she was met by Mr. Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid-- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield-- they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for . They joined company and proceeded together .
Philip Elton	"Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he exclaimed , "" A sore - throat!--I hope not infectious . I hope not of a putrid infectious sort . Has Perry seen her ?"
Philip Elton	"Let me entreat you to run no risks . Why does not Perry see her ? """
Philip Elton	But , upon my word , Mr. Elton , in your case , I should certainly excuse myself .
Philip Elton	"You appear to me a little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to - morrow will bring , I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to - night . """
Philip Elton	"Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her 's , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;-- but Emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being "" very cold , certainly very cold , "" and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening ."
Philip Elton	""" You do quite right , "" said she;--""we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston ."
Philip Elton	But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr. Elton 's only objection , and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction .
Philip Elton	It was a done thing ; Mr. Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her .
Philip Elton	""" Well , "" said she to herself , "" this is most strange!--After I had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination-- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with Mr. Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with Harriet ; but still , he can not refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked . What a strange thing love is !"
Philip Elton	"he can see ready wit in Harriet , but will not dine alone for her . "" Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard 's for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour ."
Philip Elton	"After a few minutes of entire silence between them , John Knightley began with-- "" I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr. Elton ."
Philip Elton	It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned .
Philip Elton	"With men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works . "" "" Mr. Elton 's manners are not perfect , "" replied Emma ; "" but where there is a wish to please , one ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great deal ."
Philip Elton	There is such perfect good - temper and good - will in Mr. Elton as one can not but value .
Philip Elton	""" Yes , "" said Mr. John Knightley presently , with some slyness , "" he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you ."
Philip Elton	""" Me ! "" she replied with a smile of astonishment , "" are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton 's object ?"
Philip Elton	""" Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea ! "" """
Philip Elton	I think your manners to him encouraging .
Philip Elton	"Mr. Elton and I are very good friends , and nothing more ; "" and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel . He said no more ."
Philip Elton	Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her .
Philip Elton	""" Yes , "" said John Knightley , "" and I think we shall have a good deal of it . "" "" Christmas weather , "" observed Mr. Elton ."
Philip Elton	At another time Emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at Mr. Elton 's spirits for other feelings .
Philip Elton	""" We are sure of excellent fires , "" continued he , "" and every thing in the greatest comfort ."
Philip Elton	""" I know nothing of the large parties of London , sir -- I never dine with any body . "" """
Philip Elton	Well , sir , the time must come when you will be paid for all this , when you will have little labour and great enjoyment .
Philip Elton	From Harriet 's happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father 's being present to engage Mr. Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady 's conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good . Harriet would have been a better match .
Philip Elton	I think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little . I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse-- ( looking towards Mr. Woodhouse ) , Your father 's state of health must be a great drawback .
Philip Elton	Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should .
Philip Elton	"I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good . "" "" My father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr. Perry , whose name , I dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now . "" "" Ah !"
Philip Elton	"She restrained herself , however , from any of the reproofs she could have given , and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly ; "" but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father ."
Philip Elton	I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the house too -- knowing what I had been accustomed to -- of course he was not wholly without apprehension . When he was speaking of it in that way , I honestly said that _ the _ _ world _ I could give up -- parties , balls , plays -- for I had no fear of retirement . Blessed with so many resources within myself , the world was not necessary to _ me _ .
Philip Elton	Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove ; but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , nor were spacious apartments .
Philip Elton	"Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman . "" "" And who do you think came in while we were there ? "" Emma was quite at a loss . The tone implied some old acquaintance-- and how could she possibly guess ? "" Knightley ! "" continued Mrs. Elton ; "" Knightley himself!--Was not it lucky?--for , not being within when he called the other day , I had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr. E. 's , I had a great curiosity ."
Philip Elton	"Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind!""-- All this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the Eltons ' departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending ."
Philip Elton	""" Well , my dear , "" he deliberately began , "" considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you ."
Philip Elton	""" "" I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir ."
Philip Elton	"Mr. Elton knows you . """
Philip Elton	""" But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _ bride _ ? It ought to be no recommendation to _ you _ ."
Philip Elton	It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them .
Philip Elton	""" No , my dear , I never encouraged any body to marry , but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady -- and a bride , especially , is never to be neglected ."
Philip Elton	"A bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may . """
Philip Elton	""" Well , papa , if this is not encouragement to marry , I do not know what is ."
Philip Elton	And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies .
Philip Elton	""" My dear , you do not understand me ."
Philip Elton	Her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _ her _ . Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton 's offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her .
Philip Elton	VI After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs. Suckling , the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn .
Philip Elton	"As I tell Mr. E. , you are a thorough humourist.-- Yes , believe me , Knightley , I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme . You have hit upon the very thing to please me . """
Philip Elton	He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton , and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma 's , and Harriet 's going there some very fine morning .
Philip Elton	Mr. Elton , in very good spirits , was one of the first to walk in .
Philip Elton	He joined them immediately , and , with scarcely an invitation , seated himself between them .
Philip Elton	Emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill , was willing to forget his late improprieties , and be as well satisfied with him as before , and on his making Harriet his very first subject , was ready to listen with most friendly smiles .
Philip Elton	"He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend-- her fair , lovely , amiable friend . "" Did she know?--had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably . "" And in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and Emma was quite in charity with him ."
Philip Elton	But at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on Harriet's -- more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint . He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _ promise _ _ him _ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her . She was vexed . It did appear -- there was no concealing it -- exactly like the pretence of being in love with her , instead of Harriet ; an inconstancy , if real , the most contemptible and abominable !
Philip Elton	"and she had difficulty in behaving with temper . He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore her assistance , "" Would not she give him her support?--would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard 's till it were certain that Miss Smith 's disorder had no infection ?"
Philip Elton	"He could not be satisfied without a promise-- would not she give him her influence in procuring it ? """
Philip Elton	""" So scrupulous for others , "" he continued , "" and yet so careless for herself !"
Philip Elton	She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to - day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself .
Philip Elton	Have not I some right to complain ?
Philip Elton	"I am sure of your kind support and aid . "" Emma saw Mrs. Weston 's surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose ."
Philip Elton	"She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention . She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse : "" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir ."
Philip Elton	"He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house . "" What is to be done , my dear Emma?--what is to be done ? "" was Mr. Woodhouse 's first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time ."
Philip Elton	""" Then , my dear Isabella , it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world , for in general every thing does give you cold ."
Philip Elton	Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home , I dare say .
Philip Elton	He had gone beyond the sweep-- some way along the Highbury road -- the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep -- in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground ; a very few flakes were falling at present , but the clouds were parting , and there was every appearance of its being soon over .
Philip Elton	He had seen the coachmen , and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend .
Philip Elton	Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tete - a - tete drive .
Philip Elton	To restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up -- her hand seized -- her attention demanded , and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping -- fearing -- adoring -- ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon
Philip Elton	Without scruple -- without apology-- without much apparent diffidence , Mr. Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _ her _ lover . She tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all .
Philip Elton	"Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied , "" I am very much astonished , Mr. Elton ."
Philip Elton	"you forget yourself-- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _ me _ , if you please . """
Philip Elton	"And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness , "" Mr. Elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct !"
Philip Elton	and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner .
Philip Elton	"Command yourself enough to say no more , and I will endeavour to forget it . """
Philip Elton	But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all to confuse his intellects .
Philip Elton	He perfectly knew his own meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,-- but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,--he resumed the subject of his own passion , and was very urgent for a favourable answer .
Philip Elton	"As she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied , "" It is impossible for me to doubt any longer ."
Philip Elton	You have made yourself too clear .
Philip Elton	Mr. Elton , my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express .
Philip Elton	Believe me , sir , I am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions .
Philip Elton	""" "" Good Heaven ! "" cried Mr. Elton , "" what can be the meaning of this?--"
Philip Elton	"She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton 's sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed-- "" Charming Miss Woodhouse ! allow me to interpret this interesting silence . It confesses that you have long understood me . "" "" No , sir , "" cried Emma , "" it confesses no such thing ."
Philip Elton	So far from having long understood you , I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views , till this moment .
Philip Elton	Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought seriously of her ?
Philip Elton	I am exceedingly sorry : but it is well that the mistake ends where it does . Had the same behaviour continued , Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views ; not being aware , probably , any more than myself , of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of .
Philip Elton	The Picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon after Mr. Elton 's return , and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting - room , he got up to look at it , and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as for Harriet 's feelings , they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted .
Philip Elton	Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin 's being no otherwise remembered , than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton , of the utmost advantage to the latter . Her views of improving her little friend 's mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to - morrow .
Philip Elton	Mr. Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked . He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips . They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles ; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled , and rather sentimentally recited , that well - known charade , My first doth affliction denote , Which my second is destin'd to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal.-- made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already .
Philip Elton	""" Why will not you write one yourself for us , Mr. Elton ? "" said she ; "" that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you . "" "" Oh no !"
Philip Elton	he had never written , hardly ever , any thing of the kind in his life .
Philip Elton	The stupidest fellow !
Philip Elton	"He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse""--he stopt a moment--""or Miss Smith could inspire him . """
Philip Elton	He called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , Emma was immediately convinced must be his own .
Philip Elton	""" I do not offer it for Miss Smith 's collection , "" said he ."
Philip Elton	""" Being my friend 's , I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye , but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it ."
Philip Elton	There was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend 's .
Philip Elton	"He was gone the next moment:--after another moment 's pause , "" Take it , "" said Emma , smiling , and pushing the paper towards Harriet--""it is for you . Take your own ."
Philip Elton	"She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , "" Very well , Mr. Elton , very well indeed ."
Philip Elton	I give you credit for it .
Philip Elton	This is saying very plainly--`Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you .
Philip Elton	Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance .
Philip Elton	It must be very clever , or he would not have brought it .
Philip Elton	""" There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment , "" said she , "" that I can not have a doubt as to Mr. Elton 's intentions ."
Philip Elton	You are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it .
Philip Elton	I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you .
Philip Elton	I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural .
Philip Elton	Mr. Elton 's superiority had very ample acknowledgment .
Philip Elton	""" Whatever you say is always right , "" cried Harriet , "" and therefore I suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise I could not have imagined it ."
Philip Elton	Mr. Elton , who might marry any body !
Philip Elton	There can not be two opinions about _ him _ .
Philip Elton	He is so very superior .
Philip Elton	When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted -- they do indeed -- and really it is strange ; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently , so palpably desirable -- what courts the pre - arrangement of other people , should so immediately shape itself into the proper form .
Philip Elton	You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes .
Philip Elton	""" "" That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me , of all people , who did not know him , to speak to him , at Michaelmas !"
Philip Elton	And he , the very handsomest man that ever was , and a man that every body looks up to , quite like Mr. Knightley !
Philip Elton	His company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week .
Philip Elton	Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury .
Philip Elton	When I look back to the first time I saw him !
Philip Elton	How little did I think!--The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good - natured .
Philip Elton	And how beautiful we thought he looked !
Philip Elton	He was arm - in - arm with Mr. Cole .
Philip Elton	"You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other . This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth , I could never have made any thing like it . """
Philip Elton	""" I thought he meant to try his skill , by his manner of declining it yesterday . "" "" I do think it is , without exception , the best charade I ever read . "" "" I never read one more to the purpose , certainly . "" "" It is as long again as almost all we have had before . "" "" I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour ."
Philip Elton	Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin 's prose .
Philip Elton	He will be here this evening , I dare say , and then I will give it him back , and some nonsense or other will pass between us , and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming .
Philip Elton	Depend upon it , he would not like to have his charade slighted , much better than his passion .
Philip Elton	Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th ,
Philip Elton	"He sat musing a little while , and then said , "" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does . I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . She and the children might stay very well ."
Philip Elton	Harriet turned away ; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up .
Philip Elton	His ostensible reason , however , was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse 's party could be made up in the evening without him , or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield .
Philip Elton	If he were , every thing else must give way ; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him -- had made such a point of it , that he had promised him conditionally to come .
Philip Elton	Emma thanked him , but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account ; her father was sure of his rubber .
Philip Elton	Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say .
Philip Elton	"He looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused ; said something about "" honour,""--glanced at Emma and at Harriet , and then seeing the book open on the table , took it up , and examined it very attentively ."
Philip Elton	"With the view of passing off an awkward moment , Emma smilingly said , "" You must make my apologies to your friend ; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two . He may be sure of every woman 's approbation while he writes with such gallantry ."
Philip Elton	""" "" I have no hesitation in saying , "" replied Mr. Elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; "" I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as _ I _ do -- I have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _ I _ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ) , he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life . """
Philip Elton	After this speech he was gone as soon as possible .
Philip Elton	Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh . She ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet 's share .
Philip Elton	"I Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in Emma 's opinion , had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day . She could not think that Harriet 's solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive-- "" Mr. Elton is so good to the poor ! "" she found something else must be done ."
Philip Elton	The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton .
Philip Elton	There was intimacy between them , and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton since his going away .
Philip Elton	Emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ' ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent Harriet 's being obliged to say a word . This she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury , and their card - parties .
Philip Elton	She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton ; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles , to usher in a letter from her niece .
Philip Elton	yes -- Mr. Elton , I understand -- certainly as to dancing-- Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was-- Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of Jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , Jane is so very great a favourite there . Whenever she is with us , Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can .
Philip Elton	And so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , ` I know you can not have heard from Jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ; ' and when I immediately said , ` But indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning , ' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized . ` Have you , upon your honour ? ' said she ; ` well , that is quite unexpected .
Philip Elton	Do let me hear what she says . '
Philip Elton	"You are so kind ! "" replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter.--""Oh !"
Philip Elton	I was reading it to Mrs. Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her-- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says;--but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see-- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half .
Philip Elton	"However , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother 's time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here . We never were so long without seeing her before , and as I was telling Mrs. Cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now . """
Philip Elton	A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins 's name was first mentioned in Highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her Christian name , and say whose music she principally played .
Philip Elton	Mr. Elton returned , a very happy man . He had gone away rejected and mortified -- disappointed in a very sanguine hope , after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement ; and not only losing the right lady , but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one .
Philip Elton	He had gone away deeply offended -- he came back engaged to another -- and to another as superior , of course , to the first , as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost .
Philip Elton	He came back gay and self - satisfied , eager and busy , caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse , and defying Miss Smith .
Philip Elton	The charming Augusta Hawkins , in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands as would always be called ten ; a point of some dignity , as well as some convenience : the story told well ; he had not thrown himself away -- he had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity-- the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice ; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps so quick , from the accidental rencontre , to the dinner at Mr. Green 's , and the party at Mrs. Brown's -- smiles and blushes rising in importance-- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- had in short , to use a most intelligible phrase , been so very ready to have him , that vanity and prudence were equally contented .
Philip Elton	He had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection , and was just the happy man he ought to be ; talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and , with cordial , fearless smiles , now addressing all the young ladies of the place , to whom , a few weeks ago , he would have been more cautiously gallant .
Philip Elton	The wedding was no distant event , as the parties had only themselves to please , and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for ; and when he set out for Bath again , there was a general expectation , which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole 's did not seem to contradict , that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride .
Philip Elton	During his present short stay , Emma had barely seen him ; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over , and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension , now spread over his air . She was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again .
Philip Elton	She wished him very well ; but he gave her pain , and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction .
Philip Elton	The pain of his continued residence in Highbury , however , must certainly be lessened by his marriage .
Philip Elton	Of the lady , individually , Emma thought very little . She was good enough for Mr. Elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for Highbury-- handsome enough -- to look plain , probably , by Harriet 's side .
Philip Elton	she was not so easily to be talked out of it . The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet 's mind was not to be talked away . He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her . Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love .
Philip Elton	she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton .
Philip Elton	She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other .
Philip Elton	Emma saw him only once ; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure _ just _ to meet with him , or _ just _ to miss him , _ just _ to hear his voice , or see his shoulder , _ just _ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture .
Philip Elton	She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her . Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins 's happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached!-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love ! Had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of Harriet 's mind , Emma would have been amused by its variations . Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated , sometimes the Martins ; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other .
Philip Elton	Mr. Elton 's engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin .
Philip Elton	Harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess .
Philip Elton	But Mr. Elton , in person , had driven away all such cares .
Philip Elton	While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin 's visit .
Philip Elton	XIV Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs. Weston 's drawing - room;--Mr
Philip Elton	. Elton must compose his joyous looks , and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill - humour .
Philip Elton	Mr. Elton must smile less , and Mr. John Knightley more , to fit them for
Philip Elton	This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day 's visit might not afford , which certainly did not belong to the present half - hour ; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston , her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful to Emma , and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton 's oddities , or of any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost
Philip Elton	Emma 's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion .
Philip Elton	"Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of "" Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!""-- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs. Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners ."
Philip Elton	For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet 's , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton 's nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to .
Philip Elton	"She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words "" my son , "" and "" Frank , "" and "" my son , "" repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward ."
Philip Elton	He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her . She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations . With such sensations , Mr. Elton 's civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--
Philip Elton	"for when happily released from Mr. Elton , and seated by Mr. Weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her , "" We want only two more to be just the right number ."
Philip Elton	I should like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend , Miss Smith , and my son -- and then I should say we were quite complete . I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting Frank .
Philip Elton	"I had a letter from him this morning , and he will be with us within a fortnight . """
Philip Elton	Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure ; and fully assented to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete .
Philip Elton	She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do .
Philip Elton	The case , you see , is--(but this is quite between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room .
Philip Elton	But I know they will , because it is a family that a certain lady , of some consequence , at Enscombe , has a particular dislike to : and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years , they always are put off when it comes to the point .
Philip Elton	I have not the smallest doubt of the issue .
Philip Elton	I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January , as I am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at Hartfield , that she can not calculate on their effects , as I have been long in the practice of doing .
Philip Elton	I never allow myself to speak ill of her , on Frank 's account ; for I do believe her to be very fond of him . I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body , except herself : but she has always been kind to him ( in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices , and expecting every thing to be as she likes ) .
Philip Elton	And it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though I would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper .
Philip Elton	"Then turning to Isabella , who had not been attending before--""You must know , my dear Mrs. Knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks . It depends entirely upon his aunt 's spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper ."
Philip Elton	To you -- to my two daughters -- I may venture on the truth .
Philip Elton	""" One ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but Enscombe , I believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _ she _ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her . "" "" But she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite . Now , according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _ him _ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all . "" "" My dearest Emma , do not pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a bad one , or to lay down rules for it : you must let it go its own way . I have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _ when _ it will be . """
Philip Elton	Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them ,
Philip Elton	, indeed , at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.--Robert
Philip Elton	The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day -- and Mr. Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse .
Philip Elton	"The wedding was very much like other weddings , where the parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and Mrs. Elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband , thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior to her own.--""Very little white satin , very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard of it . ""--But , in spite of these deficiencies , the wishes , the hopes , the confidence , the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony , were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union . FINIS"
Philip Elton	XVII Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield . The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and Mr. Woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella;--which poor Isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness .
Philip Elton	"The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with Mr. Elton 's best compliments , "" that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense-- and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them . "" Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr . Elton 's absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired ."
Philip Elton	She admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced .
Philip Elton	She had not even a share in his opening compliments.--Her name was not mentioned;-- and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father 's suspicion .
Philip Elton	It did , however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language .
Philip Elton	She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman 's return . She went to Mrs. Goddard 's accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was.-- She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred-- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks . The confession completely renewed her first shame -- and the sight of Harriet 's tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again .
Philip Elton	The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.-- She never could have deserved him -- and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible .
Philip Elton	She got her to Hartfield , and shewed her the most unvarying kindness , striving to occupy and amuse her , and by books and conversation , to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts .
Philip Elton	Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet 's age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton 's return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them . Harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness -- and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _ unrequited _ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force .
Philip Elton	If Mr. Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet 's persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him . Their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three .
Philip Elton	Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs. Goddard 's ; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth .
Philip Elton	"But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment . "" "" I do remember it , "" cried Emma ; "" I perfectly remember it.-- Talking about spruce - beer.--Oh ! yes -- Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr. Elton 's seeming resolved to learn to like it too ."
Philip Elton	"I must get rid of every thing.-- There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven ! of Mr. Elton . "" "" And when , "" thought Emma , "" will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill ? "" She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made , and could not but hope that the gipsy , though she had _ told _ no fortune , might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight after the alarm , they came to a sufficient explanation , and quite undesignedly ."
Philip Elton	"After another short hesitation , "" I hope it does not proceed from-- I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton ? """
Philip Elton	""" Mr. Elton indeed ! "" cried Harriet indignantly.--""Oh ! no""--and Emma could just catch the words , "" so superior to Mr. Elton ! """
Philip Elton	"Mr. Elton is going to be married . "" Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton , and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start , and a little blush , at the sound ."
Philip Elton	He had just read Elton 's letter as I was shewn in , and handed it to me directly .
Philip Elton	""" He had been so fortunate as to-- I forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them ."
Philip Elton	The information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins . By his style , I should imagine it just settled .
Philip Elton	""" Mr. Elton going to be married ! "" said Emma , as soon as she could speak ."
Philip Elton	""" He will have every body 's wishes for his happiness ."
Philip Elton	""" He is very young to settle , "" was Mr. Woodhouse 's observation . """
Philip Elton	He had better not be in a hurry .
Philip Elton	He seemed to me very well off as he was .
Philip Elton	"We were always glad to see him at Hartfield . "" "" A new neighbour for us all , Miss Woodhouse ! "" said Miss Bates , joyfully ; "" my mother is so pleased!--she says she can not bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress ."
Philip Elton	Jane , you have never seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him .
Philip Elton	""" No -- I have never seen Mr. Elton , "" she replied , starting on this appeal ; "" is he -- is he a tall man ? """
Philip Elton	"When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind . "" "" Very true , Miss Woodhouse , so she will . He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry ."
Philip Elton	His extreme attention to my mother-- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know -- it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick .
Philip Elton	Now , here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins ; and there are the Coles , such very good people ; and the Perrys
Philip Elton	""" Nobody had any information to give ; and , after a few more wonderings , Emma said , "" You are silent , Miss Fairfax -- but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news . You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell 's account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins . """
Philip Elton	""" When I have seen Mr. Elton , "" replied Jane , "" I dare say I shall be interested -- but I believe it requires _ that _ with me ."
Philip Elton	"And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off . "" "" Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse , "" said Miss Bates , "" four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs. Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man -- but'--In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries ."
Philip Elton	At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired -- Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly .
Philip Elton	But I gave what I believed the general opinion , when I called him plain .
Philip Elton	Emma , alone with her father , had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry-- and to marry strangers too -- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject . It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news , as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long ; but she was sorry for Harriet :
Philip Elton	Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly .
Philip Elton	She was not thoroughly comfortable herself . The young man 's conduct , and his sister 's , seemed the result of real feeling , and she could not but pity them .
Philip Elton	Of course , he must be sorry to lose her -- they must be all sorry .
Philip Elton	"Harriet said , "" very true , "" and she "" would not think about it ; "" but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else ; and Emma , at last , in order to put the Martins out of her head , was obliged to hurry on the news , which she had meant to give with so much tender caution ; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry , ashamed or only amused , at such a state of mind in poor Harriet -- such a conclusion of Mr. Elton 's importance with her !"
Philip Elton	Mr. Elton 's rights , however , gradually revived .
Philip Elton	VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet 's fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton 's being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet 's side , as there could be any occasion for .
Philip Elton	She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton 's being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already .
Philip Elton	She had no scruple with regard to him .
Philip Elton	He talked of Harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add .
Philip Elton	"His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet 's manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment . "" You have given Miss Smith all that she required , "" said he ; "" you have made her graceful and easy ."
Philip Elton	She was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature .
Philip Elton	""" I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints ."
Philip Elton	""" "" If it were admissible to contradict a lady , "" said the gallant Mr. Elton-- "" I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before . "" "" Exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me ."
Philip Elton	She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet 's picture .
Philip Elton	"It would be such a delight to have her picture ! "" "" Let me entreat you , "" cried Mr. Elton ; "" it would indeed be a delight !"
Philip Elton	Let me entreat you , Miss Woodhouse , to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend .
Philip Elton	I know what your drawings are .
Philip Elton	How could you suppose me ignorant ?
Philip Elton	You know nothing of drawing .
Philip Elton	Keep your raptures for Harriet 's face .
Philip Elton	""" Well , if you give me such kind encouragement , Mr. Elton , I believe I shall try what I can do ."
Philip Elton	""" Exactly so -- The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- I have not a doubt of your success ."
Philip Elton	""" But I am afraid , Mr. Elton , Harriet will not like to sit ."
Philip Elton	Did not you observe her manner of answering me ?
Philip Elton	yes , I observed it , I assure you .
Philip Elton	""" No great variety of faces for you , "" said Emma ."
Philip Elton	"Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , "" No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe . Exactly so ."
Philip Elton	But there was no doing any thing , with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch .
Philip Elton	She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence ; but was really obliged to put an end to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere .
Philip Elton	"It then occurred to her to employ him in reading . """
Philip Elton	If he would be so good as to read to them , it would be a kindness indeed !
Philip Elton	Mr. Elton was only too happy .
Philip Elton	She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed.--There was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible .
Philip Elton	She could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable .
Philip Elton	and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton 's very promising attachment was likely to add .
Philip Elton	Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr. Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again .
Philip Elton	"Every body who saw it was pleased , but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures , and defended it through every criticism . """
Philip Elton	"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted,""--observed Mrs. Weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover.--""The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes ."
Philip Elton	"It is the fault of her face that she has them not . "" "" Do you think so ? "" replied he ."
Philip Elton	""" I can not agree with you ."
Philip Elton	It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature .
Philip Elton	I never saw such a likeness in my life .
Philip Elton	"Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr. Elton warmly added , "" Oh no !"
Philip Elton	""" You , sir , may say any thing , "" cried Mr. Elton , "" but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of Miss Smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit !"
Philip Elton	I can not keep my eyes from it .
Philip Elton	"I never saw such a likeness . "" The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties ."
Philip Elton	But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton , than it was removed .
Philip Elton	His gallantry was always on the alert .
Philip Elton	""" Might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it !"
Philip Elton	he could ride to London at any time .
Philip Elton	It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand .
Philip Elton	""" "" He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world,""--brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and a very few minutes settled the business . Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough ."
Philip Elton	""" What a precious deposit ! "" said he with a tender sigh , as he received it ."
Philip Elton	""" This man is almost too gallant to be in love , "" thought Emma ."
Philip Elton	He is an excellent young man , and will suit Harriet exactly ; it will be an ` Exactly so , ' as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal .
Philip Elton	"But it is his gratitude on Harriet 's account . """
Philip Elton	""" If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man , I could have borne any thing ."
Philip Elton	"He might have doubled his presumption to me-- but poor Harriet ! "" How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet -- never !"
Philip Elton	His manners , however , must have been unmarked , wavering , dubious , or she could not have been so misled .
Philip Elton	The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!-- and the charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;-- how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet .
Philip Elton	Certainly she had often , especially of late , thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant ; but it had passed as his way , as a mere error of judgment , of knowledge , of taste , as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society , that with all the gentleness of his address , true elegance was sometimes wanting ; but , till this very day , she had never , for an instant , suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet 's friend . To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility .
Philip Elton	She remembered what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself . It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr. Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others . Contrary to the usual course of things , Mr. Elton 's wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion . His professions and his proposals did him no service .
Philip Elton	She thought nothing of his attachment , and was insulted by his hopes .
Philip Elton	He wanted to marry well , and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for .
Philip Elton	There had been no real affection either in his language or manners .
Philip Elton	She need not trouble herself to pity him .
Philip Elton	He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied , he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty , or with ten .
Philip Elton	But -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ) , to marry him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!--look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!-- It was most provoking .
Philip Elton	Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind .
Philip Elton	The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior . He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family -- and that the Eltons were nobody . The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate , to which all the rest of Highbury belonged ; but their fortune , from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself , in every other kind of consequence ; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago , to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade , or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.-- But he had fancied her in love with him ; that evidently must have been his dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as ( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like Mr. Elton , in fancying himself a very decided favourite . If _ she _ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _ he _ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers .
Philip Elton	"She was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more . "" Here have I , "" said she , "" actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man . She might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if I had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him . Oh !"
Philip Elton	that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin .
Philip Elton	, they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope . Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it . It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that Harriet 's nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive-- and that there could be no necessity for any body 's knowing what had passed except the three principals , and
Philip Elton	"The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton 's absenting himself . It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them,-- "" Ah !"
Philip Elton	Mr. Knightley , why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton ?
Philip Elton	""" These days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions ; and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill - humour at Randalls , that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield . He was always agreeable and obliging , and speaking pleasantly of every body ."
Philip Elton	""" It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet 's behalf , though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom ; for evil in that quarter was at hand . As Frank Churchill 's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton 's engagement in the conversation of Highbury , as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first , so now upon Frank Churchill 's disappearance , Mr. Elton 's concerns were assuming the most irresistible form.--His"
Philip Elton	He would soon be among them again ; Mr. Elton and his bride .
Philip Elton	"There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before "" Mr. Elton and his bride "" was in every body 's mouth , and Frank Churchill was forgotten . Emma grew sick at the sound ."
Philip Elton	She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton ; and Harriet 's mind , she had been willing to hope , had been lately gaining strength .
Philip Elton	""" Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton 's marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _ me _ ."
Philip Elton	"Emma continued , "" I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity ."
Philip Elton	The coming of her sister 's family was so very near at hand , that first in anticipation , and then in reality , it became henceforth her prime object of interest ; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected -- she did not herself expect-- that any thing beyond occasional , fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers .
Philip Elton	They might advance rapidly if they would , however ; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no . She hardly wished to have more leisure for them .
Philip Elton	There are people , who the more you do for them , the less they will do for themselves .
Philip Elton	Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley , from having been longer than usual absent from Surry , were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest .
Philip Elton	Till this year , every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey ; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea - bathing for the children , and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions , or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse , who could not be induced to get so far as London , even for poor Isabella 's sake ; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit . He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety .
Philip Elton	The bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them .
Philip Elton	Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty , elegant little woman , of gentle , quiet manners , and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate ; wrapt up in her family ; a devoted wife , a doating mother , and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that , but for these higher ties , a warmer love might have seemed impossible .
Philip Elton	She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness ; and with this resemblance of her father , she inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in her own health , over - careful of that of her children , had many fears and many nerves , and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry . They were alike too , in a general benevolence of temper , and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance .
Philip Elton	Mr. John Knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour .
Philip Elton	He was not an ill - tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased .
Philip Elton	He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing . He was not a great favourite with his fair sister - in - law .
Philip Elton	""" Pretty well , my dear -- I hope -- pretty well.--I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably . "" Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls ."
Philip Elton	""" "" Very much to the honour of both , "" was the handsome reply ."
Philip Elton	""" And do you see her , sir , tolerably often ? "" asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father ."
Philip Elton	"Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--""Not near so often , my dear , as I could wish . "" "" Oh !"
Philip Elton	papa , we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married .
Philip Elton	Either in the morning or evening of every day , excepting one , have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston , and generally both , either at Randalls or here -- and as you may suppose , Isabella , most frequently here .
Philip Elton	Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself .
Philip Elton	Papa , if you speak in that melancholy way , you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all .
Philip Elton	"Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed , but every body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated -- which is the exact truth . """
Philip Elton	""" Just as it should be , "" said Mr. John Knightley , "" and just as I hoped it was from your letters ."
Philip Elton	Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy .
Philip Elton	I have been always telling you , my love , that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have Emma 's account , I hope you will be satisfied .
Philip Elton	""" Why , to be sure , "" said Mr. Woodhouse--""yes , certainly -- I can not deny that Mrs. Weston , poor Mrs. Weston , does come and see us pretty often-- but then -- she is always obliged to go away again ."
Philip Elton	""" "" It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not , papa.-- You quite forget poor Mr. Weston . "" "" I think , indeed , "" said John Knightley pleasantly , "" that Mr. Weston has some little claim ."
Philip Elton	I , being a husband , and you not being a wife , the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force .
Philip Elton	As for Isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can .
Philip Elton	"' Tis a sad business . "" "" Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I can not possibly"
Philip Elton	say ` poor Miss Taylor . '
Philip Elton	She meant to be very happy , in spite of the scene being laid at Mr. Cole 's ; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr. Elton , even in the days of his favour , none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole .
Philip Elton	The less worthy females were to come in the evening , with Miss Bates , Miss Fairfax , and Miss Smith ; but already , at dinner , they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general ; and , while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over , Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour .
Philip Elton	"Jane Fairfax did look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend . In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her . She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte , she felt too much in the secret herself , to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair , and therefore purposely kept at a distance ; but by the others , the subject was almost immediately introduced , and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received , the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of "" my excellent friend Colonel Campbell . """
Philip Elton	""" And she , "" Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton . "" Emma restrained her indignation , and only turned from her in silence ."
Mr. Perry	Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury , and longed to dance again ; and the last half - hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls , was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject .
Mr. Perry	Frank 's was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance . But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest .
Mr. Perry	His first proposition and request , that the dance begun at Mr. Cole 's should be finished there -- that the same party should be collected , and the same musician engaged , met with the readiest acquiescence .
Mr. Perry	Every door was now closed , the passage plan given up , and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again ; and with such good - will on Frank Churchill 's part , that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple , was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten .
Mr. Perry	""" We were too magnificent , "" said he ."
Mr. Perry	""" Very true , "" he gravely replied ; "" it was very bad . """
Mr. Perry	"But still he went on measuring , and still he ended with , "" I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple . """
Mr. Perry	""" No , no , "" said she , "" you are quite unreasonable ."
Mr. Perry	""" There is no denying it , "" he replied . "" I agree with you exactly ."
Mr. Perry	"It would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- I do not know that -- I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well . """
Mr. Perry	Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self - willed , and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest . Had she intended ever to _ marry _ him , it might have been worth while to pause and consider , and try to understand the value of his preference , and the character of his temper ; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance , he was
Mr. Perry	Before the middle of the next day , he was at Hartfield ; and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme .
Mr. Perry	It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement .
Mr. Perry	""" Well , Miss Woodhouse , "" he almost immediately began , "" your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope , by the terrors of my father 's little rooms . I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a thought of my father 's , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon ."
Mr. Perry	"May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ? "" "" The Crown ! "" """
Mr. Perry	Yes ; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there .
Mr. Perry	Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _ any _ _ thing _ to like to yield .
Mr. Perry	"consent-- I hope you consent ? """
Mr. Perry	"Papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ? """
Mr. Perry	""" No ; he thought it very far from an improvement -- a very bad plan-- much worse than the other ."
Mr. Perry	He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh ! no -- a very bad plan .
Mr. Perry	""" "" I was going to observe , sir , "" said Frank Churchill , "" that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body 's catching cold-- so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls !"
Mr. Perry	Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could .
Mr. Perry	""" Sir , "" said Mr. Woodhouse , rather warmly , "" you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character ."
Mr. Perry	"Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill . But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father 's house . "" "" From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir ."
Mr. Perry	"We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief . "" "" Open the windows!--but"
Mr. Perry	, Mr. Churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls . Nobody could be so imprudent !
Mr. Perry	I never heard of such a thing .
Mr. Perry	"Dancing with open windows!--I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs. Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it . "" """
Mr. Perry	Ah ! sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected .
Mr. Perry	""" "" Have you indeed , sir?--Bless me !"
Mr. Perry	"If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done . "" "" But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited-- "" "" Oh ! "" interrupted Emma , "" there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over ."
Mr. Perry	If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses .
Mr. Perry	""" "" So they will , my dear ."
Mr. Perry	"I do not know her , even by sight . "" "" I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs. Weston 's care ."
Mr. Perry	""" There , papa!--Now you must be satisfied -- Our own dear Mrs. Weston , who is carefulness itself ."
Mr. Perry	Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ?
Mr. Perry	` If _ Miss _ _ Taylor _ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir . '
Mr. Perry	"How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ! """
Mr. Perry	Mr. Perry did say so .
Mr. Perry	You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry 's great attention .
Mr. Perry	He came four times a day for a week . He said , from the first , it was a very good sort -- which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint .
Mr. Perry	"I hope whenever poor Isabella 's little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry . "" "" My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment , "" said Frank Churchill , "" examining the capabilities of the house . I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . I was desired to say so from both ."
Mr. Perry	"It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . They can do nothing satisfactorily without you . "" Emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown ."
Mr. Perry	"There were Mr. and Mrs. Weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect . "" Emma , "" said she , "" this paper is worse than I expected ."
Mr. Perry	""" "" My dear , you are too particular , "" said her husband ."
Mr. Perry	"We never see any thing of it on our club - nights . "" The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant , "" Men never know when things are dirty or not ; "" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself , "" Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares . """
Mr. Perry	One perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain .
Mr. Perry	Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage ; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper .
Mr. Perry	"To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object -- if one could but tell what that would be . "" "" Yes , very true , "" cried Frank , "" very true ."
Mr. Perry	You want your neighbours ' opinions . I do not wonder at you .
Mr. Perry	They are not far off . Shall I call upon them ? Or Miss Bates ?
Mr. Perry	She is still nearer.-- And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body .
Mr. Perry	I think we do want a larger council .
Mr. Perry	Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us ?
Mr. Perry	""" "" Well -- if you please , "" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating , "" if you think she will be of any use . "" "" You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates , "" said Emma ."
Mr. Perry	""" She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing ."
Mr. Perry	She will not even listen to your questions .
Mr. Perry	""" Aye , do , Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us end the matter at once"
Mr. Perry	She will enjoy the scheme , I am sure ; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties .
Mr. Perry	""" Both sir !"
Mr. Perry	"I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece . "" "" Oh !"
Mr. Perry	I beg your pardon , sir .
Mr. Perry	Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both .
Mr. Perry	""" And away he ran ."
Mr. Perry	Long before he reappeared , attending the short , neat , brisk - moving aunt , and her elegant niece,--Mrs . Weston , like a sweet - tempered woman and a good wife , had examined the passage again , and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before-- indeed very trifling ; and here ended the difficulties of decision .
Mr. Perry	All the minor arrangements of table and chair , lights and music , tea and supper , made themselves ; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Stokes.-- Every body invited , was certainly to come ; Frank had already written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight , which could not possibly be refused .
Mr. Perry	""" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ; "" and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge 's at the time proposed ."
Mr. Perry	Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged-- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr. Perry was uneasy about her .
Mr. Perry	He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it .
Mr. Perry	Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:-- confined always to one room;--he could have wished it otherwise-- and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description .
Mr. Perry	He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them . Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful .
Mr. Perry	To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name-- mentioning that she had Mr. Perry 's decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient .
Mr. Perry	Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons , the Mrs. Perrys , and the Mrs. Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself-- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece 's appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing:-- Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful .
Mr. Perry	He had been at the pains of consulting Mr. Perry , the apothecary , on the subject
Mr. Perry	Mr. Perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse 's life ; and upon being applied to , he could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination ) that wedding - cake might certainly disagree with many -- perhaps with most people , unless taken moderately .
Mr. Perry	She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on Mr. Perry 's coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery.--There
Mr. Perry	"For a moment or two nothing was said , and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest , till she found her arm drawn within his , and pressed against his heart , and heard him thus saying , in a tone of great sensibility , speaking low , "" Time , my dearest Emma , time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your father 's sake -- I know you will not allow yourself-- . """
Mr. Perry	"Her arm was pressed again , as he added , in a more broken and subdued accent , "" The feelings of the warmest friendship -- Indignation -- Abominable scoundrel!""-- And in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded with , "" He will soon be gone ."
Mr. Perry	"Mr. Perry is not gone . "" And , after proceeding a few steps , she added-- "" I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr. Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me.--I will"
Mr. Perry	If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr. Perry . The expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know . He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .
Mr. Perry	Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard 's to attend a sick child , and Miss Nash had seen him , and he had told Miss Nash , that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park , he had met Mr. Elton , and found to his great surprize , that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to London , and not meaning to return till the morrow , though it was the whist - club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ;
Mr. Perry	Mr. Perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must
Mr. Perry	"When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind . "" "" Very true , Miss Woodhouse , so she will . He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry ."
Mr. Perry	-- I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry .
Mr. Perry	Harriet , tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word , was always very long at a purchase ; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind , Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;-- Mr. Perry walking hastily by , Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the office - door , Mr. Cole 's carriage - horses returning from exercise , or a stray letter - boy on an obstinate mule , were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect ; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray , a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket , two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone , and a string of dawdling children round the baker 's little bow - window eyeing the gingerbread , she knew she had no reason to complain , and was amused enough ; quite enough still to stand at the door .
Mr. Perry	But about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry ; I happened to meet him in the street .
Mr. Perry	Mr. Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella 's husband . He lived about a mile from Highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London . He had returned to a late dinner , after some days ' absence , and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square .
Isabella Knightley	Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate.-- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke . She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella 's invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss .
Isabella Knightley	Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister 's side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable.-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse 's carriage.--It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square .

Isabella Knightley	Now Emma could , indeed , enjoy Mr. Knightley 's visits ; now she could talk , and she could listen with true happiness , unchecked by that sense of injustice , of guilt , of something most painful , which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her , how much might at that moment , and at a little distance , be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself .
Isabella Knightley	XIII There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John Knightley , in this short visit to Hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister .
Isabella Knightley	She had nothing to wish otherwise , but that the days did not pass so swiftly . It was a delightful visit;--perfect , in being much too short .
Isabella Knightley	Harriet , Mr. Elton , and Mr. Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr. Woodhouse 's habits and inclination being consulted in every thing .
Isabella Knightley	"Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her 's , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;-- but Emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being "" very cold , certainly very cold , "" and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening ."
Isabella Knightley	Mrs. Weston 's friends were all made happy by her safety ; and if the satisfaction of her well - doing could be increased to Emma , it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl . She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston . She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her , hereafter , with either of Isabella 's sons ; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best .
Isabella Knightley	She was aware herself , that , parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not have rested , as it now almost wholly did , on Isabella 's letters .
Isabella Knightley	Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .
Isabella Knightley	Emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston , whose marriages taking them from Hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from Hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?-- He would not deny that he did , she was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him?-- Who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes
Isabella Knightley	To Emma 's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley 's , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion.-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs. Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one--
Isabella Knightley	""" Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister ."
Isabella Knightley	""" Then , my dear Isabella , it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world , for in general every thing does give you cold ."
Isabella Knightley	Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home , I dare say .
Isabella Knightley	""" Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan ."
Isabella Knightley	Isabella then went to Emma ; but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away ; and they were still discussing the point , when Mr. Knightley , who had left the room immediately after his brother 's first report of the snow ,
Isabella Knightley	To Isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father 's account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls .
Isabella Knightley	He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it .
Isabella Knightley	Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tete - a - tete drive .
Isabella Knightley	"I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!-- No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received-- "" "" Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it . I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend ."
Isabella Knightley	The name makes me think of poor Isabella ; for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama .
Isabella Knightley	I hope we shall have her here next week .
Isabella Knightley	Have you thought , my dear , where you shall put her -- and what room there will be for the children ?
Isabella Knightley	yes -- she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual , you know .
Isabella Knightley	""" "" I do not know , my dear -- but it is so long since she was here!--not since last Easter , and then only for a few days.--Mr . John Knightley 's being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly taken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here ! """
Isabella Knightley	""" She will not be surprized , papa , at least ."
Isabella Knightley	I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married .
Isabella Knightley	""" We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us , while Isabella is here ."
Isabella Knightley	""" Yes , my dear , if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she is coming for only one week ."
Isabella Knightley	""" "" It would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield . "" Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley 's claims on his brother , or any body 's claims on Isabella , except his own ."
Isabella Knightley	"He sat musing a little while , and then said , "" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does . I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . She and the children might stay very well ."
Isabella Knightley	Isabella can not bear to stay behind her husband .
Isabella Knightley	Unwelcome as it was , Mr. Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter 's attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them .
Isabella Knightley	Some people are surprized , I believe , that the eldest was not , but Isabella would have him called Henry , which I thought very pretty of her .
Isabella Knightley	The misfortune of Harriet 's cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella 's coming , and of Emma 's being to follow ,
Isabella Knightley	"Then turning to Isabella , who had not been attending before--""You must know , my dear Mrs. Knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks . It depends entirely upon his aunt 's spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper ."
Isabella Knightley	To you -- to my two daughters -- I may venture on the truth .
Isabella Knightley	""" Oh , Mrs. Churchill ; every body knows Mrs. Churchill , "" replied Isabella : "" and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion ."
Isabella Knightley	Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston . She should then have heard more : Mrs. Weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge .
Isabella Knightley	"While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying , "" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain ."
Isabella Knightley	The intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield , to allow them the fortnight 's absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan.--John and Isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it .
Isabella Knightley	Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately ?
Isabella Knightley	Jane , do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley .
Isabella Knightley	It must be done directly ; it must be done in London ; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on ; and Isabella , the usual doer of all commissions , must not be applied to , because it was December , and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs
Isabella Knightley	It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives Isabella all her popularity.-- I have it not -- but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet
John Knightley	Emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in Mrs. Goddard 's unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton 's would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much . She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard 's door , when she was met by Mr. Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid-- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield-- they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for . They joined company and proceeded together .
John Knightley	"After a few minutes of entire silence between them , John Knightley began with-- "" I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr. Elton ."
John Knightley	""" Yes , "" said Mr. John Knightley presently , with some slyness , "" he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you ."
John Knightley	""" Me ! "" she replied with a smile of astonishment , "" are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton 's object ?"
John Knightley	""" Such an imagination has crossed me , I own , Emma ; and if it never occurred to you before , you may as well take it into consideration now ."
John Knightley	I do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly .
John Knightley	I think your manners to him encouraging .
John Knightley	I speak as a friend , Emma .
John Knightley	""" "" I thank you ; but I assure you you are quite mistaken ."
John Knightley	"Mr. Elton and I are very good friends , and nothing more ; "" and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel . He said no more ."
John Knightley	The preparing and the going abroad in such weather , with the sacrifice of his children after dinner , were evils , were disagreeables at least , which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like ; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase ; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent .
John Knightley	""" A man , "" said he , "" must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him . He must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; I could not do such a thing ."
John Knightley	""" Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the "" Very true , my love , "" which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all . She could not be complying , she dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence ."
John Knightley	She allowed him to talk , and arranged the glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her lips .
John Knightley	"His face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered . """
John Knightley	no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard 's door , which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress , I was told that Miss Smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse . Very much grieved and concerned-- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning .
John Knightley	"Mr. Perry has been with her , as you probably heard . "" "" Yes -- I imagined -- that is -- I did not-- "" "" He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report ."
John Knightley	"Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things , and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment . "" What an excellent device , "" said he , "" the use of a sheepskin for carriages ."
John Knightley	snows a little I see .
John Knightley	""" Yes , "" said John Knightley , "" and I think we shall have a good deal of it . "" "" Christmas weather , "" observed Mr. Elton ."
John Knightley	I was snowed up at a friend 's house once for a week .
John Knightley	"I went for only one night , and could not get away till that very day se'nnight . """
John Knightley	"Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly , "" I can not wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls . """
John Knightley	I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma , ) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr. Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings .
John Knightley	""" My first enjoyment , "" replied John Knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , "" will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again . """
John Knightley	Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .
John Knightley	""" John does not even mention your friend , "" said Mr. Knightley ."
John Knightley	""" Here is his answer , if you like to see it . "" It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage ."
John Knightley	Emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned .
John Knightley	""" John enters like a brother into my happiness , "" continued Mr. Knightley , "" but he is no complimenter ; and though I well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise . But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes ."
John Knightley	""" He writes like a sensible man , "" replied Emma , when she had read the letter ."
John Knightley	""" I honour his sincerity ."
John Knightley	"It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already . Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him . "" """
John Knightley	My Emma , he means no such thing .
John Knightley	"He only means-- "" "" He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two , "" interrupted she , with a sort of serious smile--""much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject ."
John Knightley	""" Emma , my dear Emma-- "" "" Oh ! "" she cried with more thorough gaiety , "" if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion ."
John Knightley	Depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing _ you _ justice .
John Knightley	He will think all the happiness , all the advantage , on your side of the question ; all the merit on mine .
John Knightley	I wish I may not sink into ` poor Emma ' with him at once.-- His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther .
John Knightley	""" "" Ah ! "" he cried , "" I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together ."
John Knightley	I am amused by one part of John 's letter-- did you notice it?--where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind .
John Knightley	""" "" If I understand your brother , he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying ."
John Knightley	He had no idea of me .
John Knightley	"He seems perfectly unprepared for that . "" "" Yes , yes -- but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings ."
John Knightley	What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.-- But it was so , I suppose .
John Knightley	I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` Uncle seems always tired now . '
John Knightley	well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse 's mind.--It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other-- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place . Mrs. Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield ! And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable!-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband 's plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma .
John Knightley	"Mr. Elton cared little about it , compared with his wife ; he only hoped "" the young lady 's pride would now be contented ; "" and supposed "" she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ; "" and , on the point of living at Hartfield , could daringly exclaim , "" Rather he than I!""-- But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--""Poor Knightley !"
John Knightley	Emma shall be an angel , and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella . John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children .
John Knightley	He went to town on business three days ago , and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John.--He delivered these papers to John , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley 's . They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley 's .
John Knightley	The party was to be our brother and sister , Henry , John -- and Miss Smith .
John Knightley	"She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention . She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse : "" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir ."
John Knightley	""" I admired your resolution very much , sir , "" said he , "" in venturing out in such weather , for of course you saw there would be snow very soon ."
John Knightley	I admired your spirit ; and I dare say we shall get home very well .
John Knightley	I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight .
John Knightley	The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them .
John Knightley	""" You had better order the carriage directly , my love , "" said she ; "" I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk ."
John Knightley	Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend .
John Knightley	If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed!--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse ! who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near !
John Knightley	No , upon my honour , there is no unsteadiness of character .
John Knightley	I have thought only of you .
John Knightley	I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else .
John Knightley	Every thing that I have said or done , for many weeks past , has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself .
John Knightley	No!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me .
John Knightley	As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings-- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared , ) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent .
John Knightley	Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought seriously of her ?
John Knightley	""" Never , madam , "" cried he , affronted in his turn : "" never , I assure you . _"
John Knightley	"I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!-- No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received-- "" "" Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it . I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend ."
John Knightley	In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance .
John Knightley	I am exceedingly sorry : but it is well that the mistake ends where it does . Had the same behaviour continued , Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views ; not being aware , probably , any more than myself , of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of .
John Knightley	"But , as it is , the disappointment is single , and , I trust , will not be lasting . I have no thoughts of matrimony at present . "" He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace . If there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment . Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma"
John Knightley	I wonder which she will think the handsomest , Henry or John ?
John Knightley	Henry is a fine boy , but John is very like his mama .
John Knightley	John , the second , is named after his father .
John Knightley	. Elton must compose his joyous looks , and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill - humour .
John Knightley	Mr. Elton must smile less , and Mr. John Knightley more , to fit them for
John Knightley	The intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield , to allow them the fortnight 's absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan.--John and Isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it .
Robert Martin	Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin .
Robert Martin	""" It is so , indeed , "" continued Mr. Knightley ; "" I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left me not half an hour ago . "" She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement . "" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were the same . But in time they will . Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject ."
Robert Martin	It seems an impossibility!--You can not mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin .
Robert Martin	You can not mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet .
Robert Martin	"You only mean , that he intends it . "" """
Robert Martin	"I mean that he has done it , "" answered Mr. Knightley , with smiling but determined decision , "" and been accepted ."
Robert Martin	He went to town on business three days ago , and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John.--He delivered these papers to John , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley 's . They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley 's .
Robert Martin	, I must say , that Robert Martin 's heart seemed for _ him _ , and to _ me _ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at Astley 's , my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John , and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy .
Robert Martin	His situation is an evil -- but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend ; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more .
Robert Martin	His good sense and good principles would delight you.--As far as the man is concerned , you could not wish your friend in better hands .
Robert Martin	His rank in society I would alter if I could , which is saying a great deal I assure you , Emma.--You laugh at me about William Larkins ; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin .
Robert Martin	_ Her _ connexions may be worse than _ his _ .
Robert Martin	how peculiarly unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before .
Robert Martin	"Emma could not help laughing as she answered , "" Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But , Mr. Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _ accepted _ him . I could suppose she might in time -- but can she already?-- Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him?--It was not Harriet 's hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox . "" The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was , at this moment , so strong to Emma 's feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet 's side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , "" No , I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin , "" that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature ."
Robert Martin	Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are ?
Robert Martin	""" I am quite sure , "" he replied , speaking very distinctly , "" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so ."
Robert Martin	He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do .
Robert Martin	He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends .
Robert Martin	I assured him that I could not .
Robert Martin	Then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day .
Robert Martin	I have taken some pains for your sake , and for Robert Martin 's sake , ( whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever , ) to get acquainted with her .
Robert Martin	Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin 's cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.-- Much of this , I have no doubt , she may thank you for .
Robert Martin	Her father 's business was to announce James 's being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing .
Robert Martin	Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own .
Robert Martin	It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin .
Robert Martin	. Weston was alone in the drawing - room:-- but hardly had they been told of the baby , and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for coming , which he asked for , when a glimpse was caught through the blind , of two figures passing near the window .
Robert Martin	""" I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning ."
Robert Martin	He stays till to - morrow , and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us.--They
Robert Martin	"Emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried , "" Ah ! by the bye , "" then sinking his voice , and looking demure for the moment--""I hope Mr. Knightley is well ? "" He paused.--She coloured and laughed.--""I know you saw my letter , and think you may remember my wish in your favour . Let me return your congratulations.-- I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He is a man whom I can not presume to praise . """
Robert Martin	"I should certainly have called at Hartfield , had you failed to come . "" The others had been talking of the child , Mrs. Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant 's appearing not quite well ."
Robert Martin	She believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr. Perry .
Robert Martin	, however , the child had been perfectly well again . This was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it .
Robert Martin	""" She should always send for Perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment ."
Robert Martin	She could not be too soon alarmed , nor send for Perry too often .
Robert Martin	"It was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it . """
Robert Martin	""" Perry ! "" said he to Emma , and trying , as he spoke , to catch Miss Fairfax 's eye . "" My friend Mr. Perry !"
Robert Martin	"What are they saying about Mr. Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel now?--Has he set up his carriage ? "" Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from Jane 's countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf ."
Robert Martin	He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma 's feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley 's high superiority of character .
Robert Martin	The happiness of this most happy day , received its completion , in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced .
Robert Martin	My friend Robert could not resist .
Robert Martin	They called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as I understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain.--She
Robert Martin	made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving .
Robert Martin	He came down by yesterday 's coach , and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast , to report his proceedings , first on my affairs , and then on his own . This is all that I can relate of the how , where , and when .
Robert Martin	I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin .
Robert Martin	"""--She did not suspect him ."
Robert Martin	It was too old a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet.--They took a few turns together along
Robert Martin	""" I have reason to think , "" he replied , "" that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert Martin is the man ."
Robert Martin	Her visit to Abbey - Mill , this summer , seems to have done his business .
Robert Martin	He is desperately in love and means to marry her .
Robert Martin	""" He is very obliging , "" said Emma ; "" but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him ?"
Robert Martin	He came to the Abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it .
Robert Martin	He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , I believe , considers me as one of his best friends . He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether I thought her too young : in short , whether I approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _ your _ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him .
Robert Martin	I was very much pleased with all that he said .
Robert Martin	I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin .
Robert Martin	He always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging .
Robert Martin	He told me every thing ; his circumstances and plans , and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage .
Robert Martin	He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother .
Robert Martin	I had no hesitation in advising him to marry . He proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , I was convinced he could not do better .
Robert Martin	I praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy .
Robert Martin	If he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , I dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had . This happened the night before last .
Robert Martin	Now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard 's to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch .
Robert Martin	""" Pray , Mr. Knightley , "" said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , "" how do you know that Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday ?"
Robert Martin	""" Certainly , "" replied he , surprized , "" I do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred . Was not she the whole day with you ? "" "" Come , "" said she , "" I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me . He did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused ."
Robert Martin	Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin ?
Robert Martin	You persuaded her to refuse him .
Robert Martin	Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man , but I can not admit him to be Harriet 's equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her . By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples .
Robert Martin	""" "" Not Harriet 's equal ! "" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , "" No , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation ."
Robert Martin	What are Harriet Smith 's claims , either of birth , nature or education , to any connexion higher than Robert Martin ?
Robert Martin	She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all . My only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him . I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse . But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well .
Robert Martin	What ! think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more , ) a good match for my intimate friend !
Robert Martin	"They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves is much above his.--It would be a degradation . "" "" A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer ! "" "" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense . She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely"
Robert Martin	is superior to Mr. Robert Martin .
Robert Martin	Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him .
Robert Martin	I know him well . He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion .
Robert Martin	And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know .
Robert Martin	Depend upon it he had encouragement .
Robert Martin	You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet .
Robert Martin	Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed . Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour - boarder at Mrs. Goddard 's all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other , ) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master 's son .
Robert Martin	But as to my _ letting _ her marry Robert Martin , it is impossible ; she has refused him , and so decidedly , I think , as must prevent any second application .
Robert Martin	She must abide by the evil of having refused him , whatever it may be ; and as to the refusal itself , I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little ; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do .
Robert Martin	His appearance is so much against him , and his manner so bad , that if she ever were disposed to favour him , she is not now .
Robert Martin	I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him . He was the brother of her friends , and he took pains to please her ; and altogether , having seen nobody better ( that must have been his great assistant ) she might not , while she was at Abbey - Mill , find him disagreeable .
Robert Martin	""" "" Nonsense , errant nonsense , as ever was talked ! "" cried Mr. Knightley.--""Robert Martin 's manners have sense , sincerity , and good - humour to recommend them ; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand ."
Robert Martin	She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable .
Robert Martin	""" Robert Martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so ; and I hope it will not be long before he does ."
Robert Martin	Harriet 's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy . The possibility of the young man 's coming to Mrs. Goddard 's that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas . The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness
Robert Martin	Harriet 's cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of Mr. Martin , but to talk of Mr. Elton . Miss Nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight .
Robert Martin	, than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was!-- that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley , and was now forming all her views of happiness .
Robert Martin	But what did such particulars explain?-- The fact was , as Emma could now acknowledge , that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin ; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this , it must ever be unintelligible to Emma . The event , however , was most joyful ; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet 's
Robert Martin	No objection was raised on the father 's side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin , who was now introduced at Hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend . She had no doubt of Harriet 's happiness with any good - tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement . She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness . She would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out . She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;--or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself .

She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;--or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself .
Robert Martin	Harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins , was less and less at Hartfield ; which was not to be regretted.-- The intimacy between her and Emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner .
Robert Martin	Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them ,
Robert Martin	The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day -- and Mr. Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse .
Robert Martin	She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son 's wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs. Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever . With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .
Robert Martin	Mr. Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ?
Robert Martin	He does not read ?
Robert Martin	""" Oh yes!--that is , no -- I do not know -- but I believe he has read a good deal -- but not what you would think any thing of ."
Robert Martin	He reads the Agricultural Reports , and some other books that lay in one of the window seats -- but he reads all _ them _ to himself .
Robert Martin	But sometimes of an evening , before we went to cards , he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts , very entertaining .
Robert Martin	And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield .
Robert Martin	He never read the Romance of the Forest , nor The Children of the Abbey .
Robert Martin	He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them , but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can .
Robert Martin	""" The next question was-- "" What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin ? """
Robert Martin	I thought him very plain at first , but I do not think him so plain now .
Robert Martin	But did you never see him ?
Robert Martin	He is in Highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston .
Robert Martin	He has passed you very often .
Robert Martin	""" "" That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name ."
Robert Martin	It is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed -- I mean by sight .
Robert Martin	""" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man . I know , indeed , that he is so , and , as such , wish him well ."
Robert Martin	What do you imagine his age to be ?
Robert Martin	""" "" He was four - and - twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day 's difference -- which is very odd . "" "" Only four - and - twenty ."
Robert Martin	His mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry .
Robert Martin	They seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it .
Robert Martin	Six years hence , if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own , with a little money , it might be very desirable .
Robert Martin	"Dear Miss Woodhouse , he would be thirty years old ! """
Robert Martin	Mr. Martin , I imagine , has his fortune entirely to make -- cannot be at all beforehand with the world . Whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , I dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet .
Robert Martin	""" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry;--I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice ."
Robert Martin	"I want to see you permanently well connected , and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries , I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters , to be acquainted with the wife , who will probably be some mere farmer 's daughter , without education . "" "" To be sure ."
Robert Martin	Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up .
Robert Martin	However , I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's -- and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife .
Robert Martin	"I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins , especially Elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me . But if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly I had better not visit her , if I can help it . "" Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love ."
Robert Martin	The young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on Harriet 's side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own . They met Mr. Martin the very next day , as they were walking on the Donwell road .
Robert Martin	He was on foot , and after looking very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion .
Robert Martin	Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin .
Robert Martin	His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet 's inclination .
Robert Martin	Mr. Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was . They remained but a few minutes together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which Miss Woodhouse
Robert Martin	""" Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd !"
Robert Martin	It was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by Randalls .
Robert Martin	He did not think we ever walked this road .
Robert Martin	He thought we walked towards Randalls most days .
Robert Martin	He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet .
Robert Martin	He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow .
Robert Martin	Well , Miss Woodhouse , is he like what you expected ?
Robert Martin	What do you think of him ?
Robert Martin	Do you think him so very plain ?
Robert Martin	""" "" He is very plain , undoubtedly -- remarkably plain:--but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility ."
Robert Martin	I had no right to expect much , and I did not expect much ; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish , so totally without air .
Robert Martin	"I had imagined him , I confess , a degree or two nearer gentility . "" "" To be sure , "" said Harriet , in a mortified voice , "" he is not so genteel as real gentlemen . "" """
Robert Martin	I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin .
Robert Martin	I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before .
Robert Martin	"I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here . "" "" Certainly , he is not like Mr. Knightley ."
Robert Martin	He has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley . I see the difference plain enough .
Robert Martin	"But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man ! "" "" Mr. Knightley 's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with _ him _ ."
Robert Martin	You might not see one in a hundred with _ gentleman _ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley .
Robert Martin	But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to . What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton ?
Robert Martin	Compare Mr. Martin with either of _ them _ .
Robert Martin	Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at Mr. Weston 's time of life ?
Robert Martin	"He will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss . "" "" Will he , indeed ?"
Robert Martin	""" How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended ."
Robert Martin	He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else -- which is just as it should be , for a thriving man .
Robert Martin	What has he to do with books ?
Robert Martin	And I have no doubt that he _ will _ thrive , and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _ us _ .
Robert Martin	""" "" I wonder he did not remember the book""--was all Harriet 's answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself . She , therefore , said no more for some time ."
Robert Martin	"Her next beginning was , "" In one respect , perhaps , Mr. Elton 's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley 's or Mr. Weston 's ."
Robert Martin	Neither would Mr. Knightley 's downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _ him _ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable . On the contrary , I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model .
Robert Martin	Mr. Elton is good - humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle .
Robert Martin	He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late .
Robert Martin	I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , Harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be . If he means any thing , it must be to please you .
Robert Martin	"Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day ? """
Robert Martin	She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr. Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable .
Robert Martin	Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet 's head . She thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it . She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict .
Robert Martin	Mr. Elton 's situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet .
Robert Martin	He had a comfortable home for her , and Emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world .
Robert Martin	She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet 's there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy .
Robert Martin	And he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like .
Robert Martin	He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin 's riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton 's admiration .
Robert Martin	VII The very day of Mr. Elton 's going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma 's services towards her friend .
Robert Martin	"She had heard , as soon as she got back to Mrs. Goddard 's , that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from Mr. Martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage . "" Who could have thought it ?"
Robert Martin	"And he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.-- """
Robert Martin	""" Upon my word , "" she cried , "" the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking ."
Robert Martin	"He will connect himself well if he can . "" "" Will you read the letter ? "" cried Harriet ."
Robert Martin	"She paused over it , while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a "" Well , well , "" and was at last forced to add , "" Is it a good letter ? or is it too short ? "" "" Yes , indeed , a very good letter , "" replied Emma rather slowly--""so good a letter , Harriet , that every thing considered , I think one of his sisters must have helped him ."
Robert Martin	I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman .
Robert Martin	No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words .
Robert Martin	You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment .
Robert Martin	""" "" You think I ought to refuse him then , "" said Harriet , looking down ."
Robert Martin	""" Ought to refuse him !"
Robert Martin	""" "" I had no notion that he liked me so very much , "" said Harriet , contemplating the letter ."
Robert Martin	If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ?
Robert Martin	"Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes . At last , with some hesitation , Harriet said-- "" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr. Martin ."
Robert Martin	It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin .
Robert Martin	I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it .
Robert Martin	He must have a pretty good opinion of himself .
Robert Martin	""" "" I do not think he is conceited either , in general , "" said Harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; "" at least , he is very good natured , and I shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that I should -- and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _ one _ is so very handsome and agreeable ."
Robert Martin	However , I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but
Robert Martin	""" Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too . "" Emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a "" very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter ."
Robert Martin	I am quite determined to refuse him .
Robert Martin	Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence . The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all .
Robert Martin	She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton .
Robert Martin	The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected Mr. Martin .
Robert Martin	""" Now he has got my letter , "" said she softly ."
Robert Martin	""" I wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too . I hope he will not mind it so very much ."
Robert Martin	""" At this moment , perhaps , Mr. Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original , and after being asked for it five or six times , allowing them to hear your name , your own dear name . "" "" My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond - street ."
Robert Martin	""" "" Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton ."
Robert Martin	No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow .
Robert Martin	It is his companion all this evening , his solace , his delight .
Robert Martin	It opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession .
Robert Martin	They told me -- that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday .
Robert Martin	""" Oh ! "" "" He came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner ."
Robert Martin	""" Oh ! "" "" They talked a great deal about him , especially Anne Cox ."
