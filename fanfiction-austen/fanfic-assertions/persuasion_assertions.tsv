Character	Assertion
Anne Elliot	Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross , to learn that a removal from one set of people to another , though at a distance of only three miles , will often include a total change of conversation , opinion , and idea .
Anne Elliot	"She had never been staying there before , without being struck by it , or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown , or unconsidered there , were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest ; yet , with all this experience , she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson , in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle , was become necessary for her ; for certainly , coming as she did , with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks , she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove : "" So , Miss Anne , Sir Walter and your sister are gone ; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in ? "" and this , without much waiting for an answer ; or in the young ladies ' addition of , "" I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter ; but remember , papa , if we do go , we must be in a good situation : none of your Queen Squares for us ! "" or in the anxious supplement from Mary , of-- "" Upon my word , I shall be pretty well off , when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath !"
Anne Elliot	""" She could only resolve to avoid such self - delusion in future , and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell . The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard , and to destroy , their own horses , dogs , and newspapers to engage them , and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping , neighbours , dress , dancing , and music . She acknowledged it to be very fitting , that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse ; and hoped , ere long , to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into ."
Anne Elliot	With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross , it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination , her memory , and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible .
Anne Elliot	She had no dread of these two months .
Anne Elliot	Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth , nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort . She was always on friendly terms with her brother - in - law ; and in the children , who loved her nearly as well , and respected her a great deal more than their mother , she had an object of interest , amusement , and wholesome exertion . Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits . As it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else .
Anne Elliot	He had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife 's occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne 's admiration , and
Anne Elliot	""" I could manage them very well , if it were not for Mary 's interference , "" was what Anne often heard him say , and had a good deal of faith in ; but when listening in turn to Mary 's reproach of "" Charles spoils the children so that I can not get them into any order , "" she never had the smallest temptation to say , "" Very true . """
Anne Elliot	One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties , and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house .
Anne Elliot	"Known to have some influence with her sister , she was continually requested , or at least receiving hints to exert it , beyond what was practicable . "" I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill , "" was Charles 's language ; and , in an unhappy mood , thus spoke Mary : "" I do believe if Charles were to see me dying , he would not think there was anything the matter with me ."
Anne Elliot	I am sure , Anne , if you would , you might persuade him that I really am very ill -- a great deal worse than I ever own .
Anne Elliot	"And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with Anne , to say , "" Oh !"
Anne Elliot	Miss Anne , I can not help wishing Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children .
Anne Elliot	They are quite different creatures with you !
Anne Elliot	It is a pity you can not put your sister in the way of managing them .
Anne Elliot	I assure you , Miss Anne , it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should .
Anne Elliot	"I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; "" do n't do this , "" and "" do n't do that ; "" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them"
Anne Elliot	"If Jemima were not the trustiest , steadiest creature in the world , it would be enough to spoil her ; for she tells me , they are always tempting her to take a walk with them . "" And on Mrs Musgrove 's side , it was , "" I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter - in - law 's concerns , for I know it would not do ; but I shall tell you , Miss Anne , because you may be able to set things to rights , that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles 's nursery - maid : I hear strange stories of her ; she is always upon the gad ; and from my own knowledge , I can declare , she is such a fine - dressing lady , that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near ."
Anne Elliot	"Mrs Charles quite swears by her , I know ; but I just give you this hint , that you may be upon the watch ; because , if you see anything amiss , you need not be afraid of mentioning it . """
Anne Elliot	"Again , it was Mary 's complaint , that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the Great House with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place . And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves , one of them after talking of rank , people of rank , and jealousy of rank , said , "" I have no scruple of observing to you , how nonsensical some persons are about their place , because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it ; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious , especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma . Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma , but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it ."
Anne Elliot	""" How was Anne to set all these matters to rights ?"
Anne Elliot	She could do little more than listen patiently , soften every grievance , and excuse each to the other ; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours , and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister 's benefit . In all other respects , her visit began and proceeded very well .
Anne Elliot	Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject , by being removed three miles from Kellynch ; Mary 's ailments lessened by having a constant companion , and their daily intercourse with the other family , since there was neither superior affection , confidence , nor employment in the cottage , to be interrupted by it , was rather an advantage . It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible , for they met every morning , and hardly ever spent an evening asunder ; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's respectable forms in the usual places , or without the talking , laughing , and singing of their daughters .
Anne Elliot	"There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross , in less affluent circumstances , who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures : they would come at any time , and help play at anything , or dance anywhere ; and Anne , very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post , played country dances to them by the hour together ; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove more than anything else , and often drew this compliment;-- "" Well done , Miss Anne ! very well done indeed !"
Anne Elliot	Michaelmas came ; and now Anne 's heart must be in Kellynch again . A beloved home made over to others ; all the precious rooms and furniture , groves , and prospects , beginning to own other eyes and other limbs !
Anne Elliot	"She could not think of much else on the 29th of September ; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary , who , on having occasion to note down the day of the month , exclaimed , "" Dear me , is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch ?"
Anne Elliot	"Mary deplored the necessity for herself . "" Nobody knew how much she should suffer ."
Anne Elliot	"She should put it off as long as she could ; "" but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on an early day , and was in a very animated , comfortable state of imaginary agitation , when she came back ."
Anne Elliot	Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going .
Anne Elliot	She wished , however to see the Crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned . They came : the master of the house was not at home , but the two sisters were together ; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne , while the Admiral sat by Mary , and made himself very agreeable by his good - humoured notice of her little boys , she was well able to watch for a likeness , and if it failed her in the features , to catch it in the voice , or in the turn of sentiment and expression . Mrs Croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person . She had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather - beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight - and - thirty . Her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour .
Anne Elliot	"Anne gave her credit , indeed , for feelings of great consideration towards herself , in all that related to Kellynch , and it pleased her : especially , as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute , in the instant even of introduction , that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft 's side , to give a bias of any sort . She was quite easy on that head , and consequently full of strength and courage , till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft 's suddenly saying,-- "" It was you , and not your sister , I find , that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with , when he was in this country ."
Anne Elliot	""" Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing ; but the age of emotion she certainly had not ."
Anne Elliot	""" Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married ? "" added Mrs Croft ."
Anne Elliot	She could now answer as she ought ; and was happy to feel , when Mrs Croft 's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke , that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother .
Anne Elliot	She immediately felt how reasonable it was , that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward , and not of Frederick ; and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour 's present state with proper interest .
Anne Elliot	"The rest was all tranquillity ; till , just as they were moving , she heard the Admiral say to Mary-- "" We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft 's here soon ; I dare say you know him by name . """
Anne Elliot	He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys , clinging to him like an old friend , and declaring he should not go ; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets , & c. , to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun , Anne was left to persuade herself , as well as she could , that the same brother must still be in question .
Anne Elliot	She could not , however , reach such a degree of certainty , as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house , where the Crofts had previously been calling .
Anne Elliot	"The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage ; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot , the coach was beginning to be listened for , when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in . That she was coming to apologize , and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves , was the first black idea ; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted , when Louisa made all right by saying , that she only came on foot , to leave more room for the harp , which was bringing in the carriage . "" And I will tell you our reason , "" she added , "" and all about it . I am come on to give you notice , that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening , especially mamma ; she is thinking so much of poor Richard !"
Anne Elliot	I will tell you why she is out of spirits . When the Crofts called this morning , ( they called here afterwards , did not they ? ) , they happened to say , that her brother , Captain Wentworth , is just returned to England , or paid off , or something , and is coming to see them almost directly ; and most unluckily it came into mamma 's head , when they were gone , that Wentworth , or something very like it , was the name of poor Richard 's captain at one time ; I do not know when or where , but a great while before he died , poor fellow ! And upon looking over his letters and things , she found it was so , and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man , and her head is quite full of it , and of poor Richard ! So we must be as merry as we can , that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things .
Anne Elliot	He had been several years at sea , and had , in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable , and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of , been six months on board Captain Frederick Wentworth 's frigate , the Laconia ; and from the Laconia he had , under the influence of his captain , written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence ; that is to say , the only two disinterested letters ; all the rest had been mere applications for money .
Anne Elliot	In each letter he had spoken well of his captain ; but yet , so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters , so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships , that it had made scarcely any impression at the time ; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck , this very day , with a recollection of the name of Wentworth , as connected with her son , seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur . She had gone to her letters , and found it all as she supposed ; and the re - perusal of these letters , after so long an interval , her poor son gone for ever , and all the strength of his faults forgotten , had affected her spirits exceedingly , and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death . Mr Musgrove was , in a lesser degree , affected likewise ; and when they reached the cottage , they were evidently in want , first , of being listened to anew on this subject , and afterwards , of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them . To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth , repeating his name so often , puzzling over past years , and at last ascertaining that it might , that it probably would , turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting , once or twice , after their coming back from Clifton -- a very fine young man -- but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago , was a new sort of trial to Anne 's nerves .
Anne Elliot	She found , however , that it was one to which she must inure herself .
Anne Elliot	"Since he actually was expected in the country , she must teach herself to be insensible on such points . And not only did it appear that he was expected , and speedily , but the Musgroves , in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick , and very high respect for his character , stamped as it was by poor Dick 's having been six months under his care , and mentioning him in strong , though not perfectly well - spelt praise , as "" a fine dashing felow , only two perticular about the schoolmaster , "" were bent on introducing themselves , and seeking his acquaintance , as soon as they could hear of his arrival . The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening ."
Anne Elliot	Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur .
Anne Elliot	Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion , though too wise to acknowledge as much at home , where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife ; for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite , she could not but think , as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience , that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either .
Anne Elliot	Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about , and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to .
Anne Elliot	She did not attribute guile to any . It was the highest satisfaction to her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning .
Anne Elliot	It was Mary 's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from Henrietta , and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to - morrow . Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was wise .
Anne Elliot	"It was a very fine November day , and the Miss Musgroves came through the little grounds , and stopped for no other purpose than to say , that they were going to take a long walk , and therefore concluded Mary could not like to go with them ; and when Mary immediately replied , with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker , "" Oh , yes , I should like to join you very much , I am very fond of a long walk ; "" Anne felt persuaded , by the looks of the two girls , that it was precisely what they did not wish , and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce , of everything being to be communicated , and everything being to be done together , however undesired and inconvenient ."
Anne Elliot	She tried to dissuade Mary from going , but in vain ; and that being the case , thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves ' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise , as she might be useful in turning back with her sister , and lessening the interference in any plan of their own .
Anne Elliot	Could Anne have foreseen such a junction , she would have staid at home ; but , from some feelings of interest and curiosity , she fancied now that it was too late to retract , and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves , who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance .
Anne Elliot	Anne 's object was , not to be in the way of anybody ; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary , to keep with her brother and sister .
Anne Elliot	Her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day , from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves , and withered hedges , and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn , that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness , that season which had drawn from every poet , worthy of being read , some attempt at description , or some lines of feeling .
Anne Elliot	She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations ; but it was not possible , that when within reach of Captain Wentworth 's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves , she should not try to hear it ; yet she caught little very remarkable .
Anne Elliot	This distinction appeared to increase , and there was one speech of Louisa 's which struck her .
Anne Elliot	Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again .
Anne Elliot	"The sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by , unless some tender sonnet , fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year , with declining happiness , and the images of youth and hope , and spring , all gone together , blessed her memory . She roused herself to say , as they struck by order into another path , "" Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop ?"
Anne Elliot	But nobody heard , or , at least , nobody answered her .
Anne Elliot	"Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to Henrietta , Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to Captain Wentworth-- "" It is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life . "" She received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of ."
Anne Elliot	Anne found a nice seat for her , on a dry sunny bank , under the hedge - row , in which she had no doubt of their still being , in some spot or other .
Anne Elliot	till she overtook her
Anne Elliot	Anne , really tired herself , was glad to sit down ; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge - row , behind her , as if making their way back along the rough , wild sort of channel , down the centre .
Anne Elliot	"What Anne first heard was-- "" And so , I made her go . I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . What !"
Anne Elliot	""" She would have turned back then , but for you ? "" "" She would indeed ."
Anne Elliot	I am almost ashamed to say it .
Anne Elliot	After the hints you gave just now , which did but confirm my own observations , the last time I was in company with him , I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on . I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this . Your sister is an amiable creature ; but yours is the character of decision and firmness , I see .
Anne Elliot	If you value her conduct or happiness , infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can . But this , no doubt , you have been always doing .
Anne Elliot	You are never sure of a good impression being durable ; everybody may sway it .
Anne Elliot	""" He had done , and was unanswered . It would have surprised Anne if Louisa could have readily answered such a speech : words of such interest , spoken with such serious warmth !"
Anne Elliot	She could imagine what Louisa was feeling .
Anne Elliot	For herself , she feared to move , lest she should be seen .
Anne Elliot	"While she remained , a bush of low rambling holly protected her , and they were moving on . Before they were beyond her hearing , however , Louisa spoke again . "" Mary is good - natured enough in many respects , "" said she ; "" but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride -- the Elliot pride ."
Anne Elliot	We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead .
Anne Elliot	I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne ?
Anne Elliot	"After a moment 's pause , Captain Wentworth said-- "" Do you mean that she refused him ? """
Anne Elliot	I wish she had accepted him . We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell 's doing , that she did not .
Anne Elliot	"They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell , and that therefore , she persuaded Anne to refuse him . "" The sounds were retreating , and Anne distinguished no more ."
Anne Elliot	Her own emotions still kept her fixed .
Anne Elliot	She had much to recover from , before she could move .
Anne Elliot	The listener 's proverbial fate was not absolutely hers ; she had heard no evil of herself , but she had heard a great deal of very painful import .
Anne Elliot	She saw how her own character was considered by Captain Wentworth , and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation .
Anne Elliot	As soon as she could , she went after Mary , and having found , and walked back with her to their former station , by the stile , felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected , and once more in motion together .
Anne Elliot	Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give . Charles and Henrietta returned , bringing , as may be conjectured , Charles Hayter with them .
Anne Elliot	The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand ; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman 's side , and a relenting on the lady 's , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt . Henrietta looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased;-- Charles Hayter exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross . Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two .
Anne Elliot	In a long strip of meadow land , where there was ample space for all , they were thus divided , forming three distinct parties ; and to that party of the three which boasted least animation , and least complaisance , Anne necessarily belonged .
Anne Elliot	She joined Charles and Mary , and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles 's other arm ; but Charles , though in very good humour with her , was out of temper with his wife .
Anne Elliot	Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him , and was now to reap the consequence , which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch ; and when Mary began to complain of it , and lament her being ill - used , according to custom , in being on the hedge side , while Anne was never incommoded on the other , he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of , and they could hardly get him along at all .
Anne Elliot	""" Miss Elliot , I am sure you are tired , "" cried Mrs Croft ."
Anne Elliot	""" Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home ."
Anne Elliot	Here is excellent room for three , I assure you .
Anne Elliot	If we were all like you , I believe we might sit four .
Anne Elliot	"You must , indeed , you must . "" Anne was still in the lane ; and though instinctively beginning to decline , she was not allowed to proceed ."
Anne Elliot	The Admiral 's kind urgency came in support of his wife 's ; they would not be refused ; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner , and Captain Wentworth , without saying a word , turned to her , and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage .
Anne Elliot	She was in the carriage , and felt that he had placed her there , that his will and his hands had done it , that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue , and his resolution to give her rest .
Anne Elliot	She was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her , which all these things made apparent .
Anne Elliot	She understood him .
Anne Elliot	He could not forgive her , but he could not be unfeeling .
Anne Elliot	Though condemning her for the past , and considering it with high and unjust resentment , though perfectly careless of her , and though becoming attached to another , still he could not see her suffer , without the desire of giving her relief .
Anne Elliot	It was a remainder of former sentiment ; it was an impulse of pure , though unacknowledged friendship ; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart , which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain , that she knew not which prevailed . Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given . They had travelled half their way along the rough lane , before she was quite awake to what they said .
Anne Elliot	"She then found them talking of "" Frederick . "" "" He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , Sophy , "" said the Admiral ; "" but there is no saying which ."
Anne Elliot	We sailors , Miss Elliot , can not afford to make long courtships in time of war .
Anne Elliot	How many days was it , my dear , between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth ?
Anne Elliot	""" "" We had better not talk about it , my dear , "" replied Mrs Croft , pleasantly ; "" for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding , she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together ."
Anne Elliot	"I had known you by character , however , long before . "" "" Well , and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl , and what were we to wait for besides ?"
Anne Elliot	""" "" Very good humoured , unaffected girls , indeed , "" said Mrs Croft , in a tone of calmer praise , such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother ; "" and a very respectable family ."
Anne Elliot	""" But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger ; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut , nor ran foul of a dung - cart ; and Anne , with some amusement at their style of driving , which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs"
Anne Elliot	, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage .
Anne Elliot	: the day was even fixed ; and Anne , being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled , was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch , and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it .
Anne Elliot	It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth , within half a mile of him ; they would have to frequent the same church , and there must be intercourse between the two families .
Anne Elliot	This was against her ; but on the other hand , he spent so much of his time at Uppercross , that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind , than as going towards him ; and , upon the whole , she believed she must , on this interesting question , be the gainer , almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society , in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell
Anne Elliot	She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall : those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her ; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere .
Anne Elliot	They did not like each other , and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good ; and were Lady Russell to see them together , she might think that he had too much self - possession , and she too little . These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross , where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough .
Anne Elliot	Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months ' visit there ,
Anne Elliot	but he was gaining strength apace , and she had nothing else to stay for .
Anne Elliot	The conclusion of her visit , however , was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined .
Anne Elliot	""" And yet , "" said Anne to herself , as they now moved forward to meet the party , "" he has not , perhaps , a more sorrowing heart than I have . I can not believe his prospects so blighted for ever ."
Anne Elliot	He is younger than I am ; younger in feeling , if not in fact ; younger as a man .
Anne Elliot	There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this , and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon , so unlike the usual style of give - and - take invitations , and dinners of formality and display , that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother - officers .
Anne Elliot	""" These would have been all my friends , "" was her thought ;"
Anne Elliot	and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness .
Anne Elliot	On quitting the Cobb , they all went in - doors with their new friends , and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many . Anne had a moment 's astonishment on the subject herself ; but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville , to turn the actual space to the best account , to supply the deficiencies of lodging - house furniture , and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected .
Anne Elliot	The varieties in the fitting - up of the rooms , where the common necessaries provided by the owner , in the common indifferent plight , were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood , excellently worked up , and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited , were more than amusing to Anne ; connected as it all was with his profession , the fruit of its labours , the effect of its influence on his habits , the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented , made it to her a something more , or less , than gratification .
Anne Elliot	He drew , he varnished , he carpentered , he glued ; he made toys for the children ; he fashioned new netting - needles and pins with improvements ; and if everything else was done , sat down to his large fishing - net at one corner of the room . Anne thought she left great happiness behind her
Anne Elliot	Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in Captain Wentworth 's company than she had at first imagined could ever be , that the sitting down to the same table with him now , and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it ( they never got beyond ) , was become a mere nothing .
Anne Elliot	While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to Anne 's lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him .
Anne Elliot	He was shy , and disposed to abstraction ; but the engaging mildness of her countenance , and gentleness of her manners , soon had their effect ; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion . He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading , though principally in poetry ; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening 's indulgence in the discussion of subjects , which his usual companions had probably no concern in , she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction , which had naturally grown out of their conversation . For , though shy , he did not seem reserved ; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints ; and having talked of poetry , the richness of the present age , and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first - rate poets , trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred , and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos ; and moreover , how the Giaour was to be pronounced , he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet , and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other ; he repeated , with such tremulous feeling , the various lines which imaged a broken heart , or a mind destroyed by wretchedness , and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood , that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry , and to say , that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely ; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly . His looks shewing him not pained , but pleased with this allusion to his situation , she was emboldened to go on ; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind , she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study ; and on being requested to particularize , mentioned such works of our best moralists , such collections of the finest letters , such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering , as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts , and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances . Captain Benwick listened attentively , and seemed grateful for the interest implied ; and though with a shake of the head , and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his , noted down the names of those she recommended , and promised to procure and read them
Anne Elliot	When the evening was over , Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination .
Anne Elliot	A very few days more , and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch , and Mr Musgrove had called on him , and come back warm in his praise , and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross , by the end of another week . It had been a great disappointment to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed , so impatient was he to shew his gratitude , by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own roof , and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars . But a week must pass ; only a week , in Anne 's reckoning , and then , she supposed , they must meet ; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week .
Anne Elliot	Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove 's civility , and she was all but calling there in the same half hour .
Anne Elliot	She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House , where , as she afterwards learnt , they must inevitably have found him , when they were stopped by the eldest boy 's being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall . The child 's situation put the visit entirely aside ; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference , even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account .
Anne Elliot	It was an afternoon of distress , and Anne had every thing to do at once ; the apothecary to send for , the father to have pursued and informed , the mother to support and keep from hysterics , the servants to control , the youngest child to banish , and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe ; besides sending , as soon as she recollected it , proper notice to the other house , which brought her an accession rather of frightened , enquiring companions , than of very useful assistants .
Anne Elliot	Her brother 's return was the first comfort ; he could take best care of his wife ; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary .
Anne Elliot	Till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar - bone was soon replaced , and though Mr Robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew 's state , as to give the information of Captain Wentworth 's visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before .
Anne Elliot	""" Oh no ; as to leaving the little boy , "" both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought ; and Anne , in the joy of the escape , could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs ."
Anne Elliot	Your sister being with you , my love , I have no scruple at all .
Anne Elliot	"Anne will send for me if anything is the matter . "" Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain . Mary knew , from Charles 's manner of speaking , that he was quite determined on going , and that it would be of no use to teaze him ."
Anne Elliot	"She said nothing , therefore , till he was out of the room , but as soon as there was only Anne to hear-- "" So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves , with this poor sick child ; and not a creature coming near us all the evening !"
Anne Elliot	"You saw how hysterical I was yesterday . "" "" But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm-- of the shock ."
Anne Elliot	You will not be hysterical again .
Anne Elliot	I perfectly understand Mr Robinson 's directions , and have no fears ; and indeed , Mary , I can not wonder at your husband .
Anne Elliot	I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother , but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick - room than Charles , for I can not be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if I told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about .
Anne Elliot	""" "" But , could you be comfortable yourself , to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy ? "" """
Anne Elliot	Yes ; you see his papa can , and why should not I ?
Anne Elliot	"I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is . I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday , but the case is very different to - day . "" "" Well , if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself , suppose you were to go , as well as your husband . Leave little Charles to my care ."
Anne Elliot	You can make little Charles do anything ; he always minds you at a word .
Anne Elliot	I shall certainly go ; I am sure I ought if I can , quite as much as Charles , for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth , and I know you do not mind being left alone .
Anne Elliot	An excellent thought of yours , indeed , Anne .
Anne Elliot	You can send for us , you know , at a moment 's notice , if anything is the matter ; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you .
Anne Elliot	"I should not go , you may be sure , if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child . "" The next moment she was tapping at her husband 's dressing - room door , and as Anne followed her up stairs , she was in time for the whole conversation , which began with Mary 's saying , in a tone of great exultation-- "" I mean to go with you , Charles , for I am of no more use at home than you are ."
Anne Elliot	Anne will stay ; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him .
Anne Elliot	It is Anne 's own proposal , and so I shall go with you , which will be a great deal better , for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday .
Anne Elliot	""" "" This is very kind of Anne , "" was her husband 's answer , "" and I should be very glad to have you go ; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself , to nurse our sick child . """
Anne Elliot	Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause , and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him , where conviction was at least very agreeable , he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone , though he still wanted her to join them in the evening , when the child might be at rest for the night , and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her , but she was quite unpersuadable ; and this being the case , she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits . They were gone , she hoped , to be happy , however oddly constructed such happiness might seem ; as for herself , she was left with as many sensations of comfort , as were , perhaps , ever likely to be hers . She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child ; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant , making himself agreeable to others ?
Anne Elliot	She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting .
Anne Elliot	Had he wished ever to see her again , he need not have waited till this time ; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago , when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting .
Anne Elliot	Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance , and their visit in general .
Anne Elliot	Anne understood it .
Anne Elliot	He wished to avoid seeing her .
Anne Elliot	He had inquired after her , she found , slightly , as might suit a former slight acquaintance , seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged , actuated , perhaps , by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet .
Anne Elliot	The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child 's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice . Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over .
Anne Elliot	Her eye half met Captain Wentworth 's , a bow , a curtsey passed ; she heard his voice ; he talked to Mary , said all that was right , said something to the Miss Musgroves , enough to mark an easy footing ; the room seemed full , full of persons and voices , but a few minutes ended it .
Anne Elliot	"Charles shewed himself at the window , all was ready , their visitor had bowed and was gone , the Miss Musgroves were gone too , suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen : the room was cleared , and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could . "" It is over !"
Anne Elliot	"it is over ! "" she repeated to herself again and again , in nervous gratitude ."
Anne Elliot	Mary talked , but she could not attend .
Anne Elliot	She had seen him .
Anne Elliot	Soon , however , she began to reason with herself , and try to be feeling less .
Anne Elliot	It included nearly a third part of her own life .
Anne Elliot	with all her reasoning , she found , that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing .
Anne Elliot	Was this like wishing to avoid her ? And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question .
Anne Elliot	"On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented , she was soon spared all suspense ; for , after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary : -- "" Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you , Anne , though he was so attentive to me ."
Anne Elliot	Henrietta asked him what he thought of you , when they went away , and he said , ` You were so altered he should not have known you again . '
Anne Elliot	"Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister 's in a common way , but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound . "" Altered beyond his knowledge . """
Anne Elliot	Anne fully submitted , in silent , deep mortification .
Anne Elliot	Doubtless it was so , and she could take no revenge , for he was not altered , or not for the worse .
Anne Elliot	She had already acknowledged it to herself , and she could not think differently , let him think of her as he would .
Anne Elliot	No : the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing , manly , open look , in no respect lessening his personal advantages .
Anne Elliot	She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth .
Anne Elliot	""" So altered that he should not have known her again ! """
Anne Elliot	These were words which could not but dwell with her .
Anne Elliot	Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them . They were of sobering tendency ; they allayed agitation ; they composed , and consequently must make her happier .
Anne Elliot	Frederick Wentworth had used such words , or something like them , but without an idea that they would be carried round to her . He had thought her wretchedly altered , and in the first moment of appeal , had spoken as he felt . He had not forgiven Anne Elliot . She had used him ill , deserted and disappointed him ; and worse , she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so , which his own decided , confident temper could not endure .
Anne Elliot	She had given him up to oblige others .
Anne Elliot	He had been most warmly attached to her , and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal ; but , except from some natural sensation of curiosity , he had no desire of meeting her again . Her power with him was gone for ever . It was now his object to marry .
Anne Elliot	He was rich , and being turned on shore , fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted ; actually looking round , ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow . He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves , if they could catch it ; a heart , in short , for any pleasing young woman who came in his way , excepting Anne Elliot .
Anne Elliot	"Should not this be enough for a sailor , who has had no society among women to make him nice ? "" He said it , she knew , to be contradicted . His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice ; and Anne Elliot was not out of his thoughts , when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with ."
Anne Elliot	16 There was one point which Anne , on returning to her family , would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot 's being in love with Elizabeth , which was , her father 's not being in love with Mrs Clay ; and she was very far from easy about it , when she had been at home a few hours .
Anne Elliot	On going down to breakfast the next morning , she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady 's side of meaning to leave them .
Anne Elliot	"She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said , that "" now Miss Anne was come , she could not suppose herself at all wanted ; "" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper , "" That must not be any reason , indeed ."
Anne Elliot	I assure you I feel it none .
Anne Elliot	"She is nothing to me , compared with you ; "" and she was in full time to hear her father say , "" My dear madam , this must not be ."
Anne Elliot	He spoke and looked so much in earnest , that Anne was not surprised to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself .
Anne Elliot	"Her countenance , perhaps , might express some watchfulness ; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister . The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties , and promise to stay . In the course of the same morning , Anne and her father chancing to be alone together , he began to compliment her on her improved looks ; he thought her "" less thin in her person , in her cheeks ; her skin , her complexion , greatly improved ; clearer , fresher ."
Anne Elliot	"Had she been using any thing in particular ? """
Anne Elliot	"he was surprised at that ; "" and added , "" certainly you can not do better than to continue as you are ; you can not be better than well ; or I should recommend Gowland , the constant use of Gowland , during the spring months ."
Anne Elliot	Mrs Clay has been using it at my recommendation , and you see what it has done for her .
Anne Elliot	"You see how it has carried away her freckles . "" If Elizabeth could but have heard this ! Such personal praise might have struck her , especially as it did not appear to Anne that the freckles were at all lessened . But everything must take its chance ."
Anne Elliot	The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour , and of Anne so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in Bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed .
Anne Elliot	"As Mr Elliot became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others . His manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told Anne , almost ready to exclaim , "" Can this be Mr Elliot ? "" and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man ."
Anne Elliot	It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently ; and it did not surprise her , therefore , that Lady Russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent , nothing to require more motives than appeared , in Mr Elliot 's great desire of a reconciliation . In Lady Russell 's view , it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot , at a mature time of life , should feel it a most desirable object , and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people , to be on good terms with the head of his family ; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear , and only erring in the heyday of youth .
Anne Elliot	"Anne presumed , however , still to smile about it , and at last to mention "" Elizabeth . """
Anne Elliot	"Lady Russell listened , and looked , and made only this cautious reply:--""Elizabeth ! very well ; time will explain . "" It was a reference to the future , which Anne , after a little observation , felt she must submit to ."
Anne Elliot	She could determine nothing at present .
Anne Elliot	In fact , Anne could never see the crape round his hat , without fearing that she was the inexcusable one , in attributing to him such imaginations ; for though his marriage had not been very happy , still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved .
Anne Elliot	However it might end , he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in Bath : she saw nobody equal to him ; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme , which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again , and to see more of , as herself .
Anne Elliot	He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness . She knew it well ; and she remembered another person 's look also .
Anne Elliot	His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers .
Anne Elliot	It was not merely complaisance , it must be a liking to the cause , which made him enter warmly into her father and sister 's solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them .
Anne Elliot	The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple , and her daughter , the Honourable Miss Carteret ; and all the comfort of No.-- , Camden Place , was swept away for many days ; for the Dalrymples ( in Anne 's opinion , most unfortunately ) were cousins of the Elliots ; and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly .
Anne Elliot	Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility , and she must acknowledge herself disappointed .
Anne Elliot	"She had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life , and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen ; a wish that they had more pride ; for "" our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret ; "" "" our cousins , the Dalrymples , "" sounded in her ears all day long ."
Anne Elliot	""" Family connexions were always worth preserving , good company always worth seeking ; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house , for three months , in Laura Place , and would be living in style . She had been at Bath the year before , and Lady Russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman ."
Anne Elliot	Sir Walter , however , would choose his own means , and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation , regret , and entreaty , to his right honourable cousin .
Anne Elliot	"They visited in Laura Place , they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple , and the Honourable Miss Carteret , to be arranged wherever they might be most visible : and "" Our cousins in Laura Place,""--""Our cousin , Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , "" were talked of to everybody ."
Anne Elliot	Anne was ashamed .
Anne Elliot	Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable , she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created , but they were nothing .
Anne Elliot	"Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name of "" a charming woman , "" because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody ."
Anne Elliot	Miss Carteret , with still less to say , was so plain and so awkward , that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but for her birth .
Anne Elliot	"when Anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to Mr Elliot , he agreed to their being nothing in themselves , but still maintained that , as a family connexion , as good company , as those who would collect good company around them , they had their value . Anne smiled and said , "" My idea of good company , Mr Elliot , is the company of clever , well - informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what I call good company . "" "" You are mistaken , "" said he gently , "" that is not good company ; that is the best . Good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice . Birth and good manners are essential ; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company ; on the contrary , it will do very well . My cousin Anne shakes her head . She is not satisfied ."
Anne Elliot	She is fastidious .
Anne Elliot	"My dear cousin "" ( sitting down by her ) , "" you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman I know ; but will it answer ?"
Anne Elliot	Will it make you happy ? Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place , and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible ?
Anne Elliot	You may depend upon it , that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter , and as rank is rank , your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family ( our family let me say ) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for .
Anne Elliot	""" Yes , "" sighed Anne , "" we shall , indeed , be known to be related to them ! """
Anne Elliot	"then recollecting herself , and not wishing to be answered , she added , "" I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance . I suppose "" ( smiling ) "" I have more pride than any of you ; but I confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them ."
Anne Elliot	""" Pardon me , dear cousin , you are unjust in your own claims ."
Anne Elliot	In London , perhaps , in your present quiet style of living , it might be as you say : but in Bath ; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing : always acceptable as acquaintance .
Anne Elliot	""" "" Well , "" said Anne , "" I certainly am proud , too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place ."
Anne Elliot	""" I love your indignation , "" said he ; "" it is very natural ."
Anne Elliot	But here you are in Bath , and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot .
Anne Elliot	"You talk of being proud ; I am called proud , I know , and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise ; for our pride , if investigated , would have the same object , I have no doubt , though the kind may seem a little different . In one point , I am sure , my dear cousin , "" ( he continued , speaking lower , though there was no one else in the room ) "" in one point , I am sure , we must feel alike ."
Anne Elliot	We must feel that every addition to your father 's society , among his equals or superiors , may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him .
Anne Elliot	""" He looked , as he spoke , to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately occupying : a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant ; and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride , she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay ; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father 's getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her ."
Anne Elliot	Anne was the nearest to him , and making yet a little advance , she instantly spoke .
Anne Elliot	"He was preparing only to bow and pass on , but her gentle "" How do you do ? "" brought him out of the straight line to stand near her , and make enquiries in return , in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground ."
Anne Elliot	Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne ; she knew nothing of their looks , and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done . While they were speaking , a whispering between her father and Elizabeth caught her ear . She could not distinguish , but she must guess the subject ; and on Captain Wentworth 's making a distant bow , she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance , and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself .
Anne Elliot	This , though late , and reluctant , and ungracious , was yet better than nothing , and her spirits improved .
Anne Elliot	"After talking , however , of the weather , and Bath , and the concert , their conversation began to flag , and so little was said at last , that she was expecting him to go every moment , but he did not ; he seemed in no hurry to leave her ; and presently with renewed spirit , with a little smile , a little glow , he said-- "" I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme ."
Anne Elliot	"I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock , and the more from its not overpowering you at the time . """
Anne Elliot	"She assured him that she had not . """
Anne Elliot	When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon , you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery .
Anne Elliot	""" "" Certainly I could have none ."
Anne Elliot	But it appears -- I should hope it would be a very happy match .
Anne Elliot	A sudden recollection seemed to occur , and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne 's cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground .
Anne Elliot	"A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman . He ought not ; he does not . "" Either from the consciousness , however , that his friend had recovered , or from other consciousness , he went no farther ; and Anne who , in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered , and in spite of all the various noises of the room , the almost ceaseless slam of the door , and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through , had distinguished every word , was struck , gratified , confused , and beginning to breathe very quick , and feel an hundred things in a moment . It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject ; and yet , after a pause , feeling the necessity of speaking , and having not the smallest wish for a total change , she only deviated so far as to say-- "" You were a good while at Lyme , I think ? "" "" About a fortnight . I could not leave it till Louisa 's doing well was quite ascertained ."
Anne Elliot	""" "" I should very much like to see Lyme again , "" said Anne ."
Anne Elliot	I should not have supposed that you could have found anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling .
Anne Elliot	The horror and distress you were involved in , the stretch of mind , the wear of spirits ! I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust .
Anne Elliot	""" "" The last hours were certainly very painful , "" replied Anne ; "" but when pain is over , the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure ."
Anne Elliot	"I have travelled so little , that every fresh place would be interesting to me ; but there is real beauty at Lyme ; and in short "" ( with a faint blush at some recollections ) ,"
Anne Elliot	""" altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable . "" As she ceased , the entrance door opened again , and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting ."
Anne Elliot	""" Lady Dalrymple , Lady Dalrymple , "" was the rejoicing sound ; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance , Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her . Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , escorted by Mr Elliot and Colonel Wallis , who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant , advanced into the room . The others joined them , and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included . She was divided from Captain Wentworth ."
Anne Elliot	Their interesting , almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time , but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on ! She had learnt , in the last ten minutes , more of his feelings towards Louisa , more of all his feelings than she dared to think of ; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party , to the needful civilities of the moment , with exquisite , though agitated sensations .
Anne Elliot	She was in good humour with all .
Anne Elliot	She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all , and to pity every one , as being less happy than herself .
Anne Elliot	The delightful emotions were a little subdued , when on stepping back from the group , to be joined again by Captain Wentworth , she saw that he was gone . She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room .
Anne Elliot	He was gone ; he had disappeared , she felt a moment 's regret .
Anne Elliot	He would look for her , he would find her out before the evening were over , and at present , perhaps , it was as well to be asunder .
Anne Elliot	"She was in need of a little interval for recollection . """
Anne Elliot	Upon Lady Russell 's appearance soon afterwards , the whole party was collected , and all that remained was to marshal themselves , and proceed into the Concert Room ; and be of all the consequence in their power , draw as many eyes , excite as many whispers , and disturb as many people as they could . Very , very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in . Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret , and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her , had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach ; and Anne -- but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne 's felicity , to draw any comparison between it and her sister 's ; the origin of one all selfish vanity , of the other all generous attachment . Anne saw nothing , thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room .
Anne Elliot	Her happiness was from within .
Anne Elliot	Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed ; but she knew nothing about it .
Anne Elliot	She was thinking only of the last half hour , and as they passed to their seats , her mind took a hasty range over it .
Anne Elliot	His choice of subjects , his expressions , and still more his manner and look , had been such as she could see in only one light .
Anne Elliot	His opinion of Louisa Musgrove 's inferiority , an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give , his wonder at Captain Benwick , his feelings as to a first , strong attachment ; sentences begun which he could not finish , his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance , all , all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least ; that anger , resentment , avoidance , were no more ; and that they were succeeded , not merely by friendship and regard , but by the tenderness of the past . Yes , some share of the tenderness of the past . She could not contemplate the change as implying less .
Anne Elliot	He must love her .
Anne Elliot	These were thoughts , with their attendant visions , which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation ; and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him , without even trying to discern him .
Anne Elliot	When their places were determined on , and they were all properly arranged , she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room , but he was not ; her eye could not reach him ; and the concert being just opening , she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way .
Anne Elliot	The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches : Anne was among those on the foremost , and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well , with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis , as to have a seat by her . Miss Elliot , surrounded by her cousins , and the principal object of Colonel Wallis 's gallantry , was quite contented .
Anne Elliot	Anne 's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening ; it was just occupation enough : she had feelings for the tender , spirits for the gay , attention for the scientific , and patience for the wearisome ; and had never liked a concert better , at least during the first act .
Anne Elliot	Towards the close of it , in the interval succeeding an Italian song , she explained the words of the song to Mr Elliot .
Anne Elliot	""" This , "" said she , "" is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an Italian love - song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give ; for I do not pretend to understand the language ."
Anne Elliot	I am a very poor Italian scholar .
Anne Elliot	""" "" Yes , yes , I see you are ."
Anne Elliot	I see you know nothing of the matter .
Anne Elliot	You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted , transposed , curtailed Italian lines , into clear , comprehensible , elegant English . You need not say anything more of your ignorance .
Anne Elliot	""" I will not oppose such kind politeness ; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient ."
Anne Elliot	""" I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long , "" replied he , "" without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot ; and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments , and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman ."
Anne Elliot	"I forget what we are to have next , "" turning to the bill ."
Anne Elliot	""" Perhaps , "" said Mr Elliot , speaking low , "" I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of . "" "" Indeed !"
Anne Elliot	You can have been acquainted with it only since I came to Bath , excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family .
Anne Elliot	""" "" I knew you by report long before you came to Bath ."
Anne Elliot	I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately . I have been acquainted with you by character many years .
Anne Elliot	"Your person , your disposition , accomplishments , manner ; they were all present to me . "" Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise ."
Anne Elliot	To have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance , by nameless people , is irresistible ; and Anne was all curiosity .
Anne Elliot	She wondered , and questioned him eagerly ; but in vain .
Anne Elliot	He would mention no names now ; but such , he could assure her , had been the fact .
Anne Elliot	He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her .
Anne Elliot	Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford , Captain Wentworth 's brother .
Anne Elliot	"He might have been in Mr Elliot 's company , but she had not courage to ask the question . "" The name of Anne Elliot , "" said he , "" has long had an interesting sound to me ."
Anne Elliot	""" Such , she believed , were his words ; but scarcely had she received their sound , than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her , which rendered every thing else trivial ."
Anne Elliot	Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking .
Anne Elliot	""" A very fine young man indeed ! "" said Lady Dalrymple ."
Anne Elliot	Irish , I dare say .
Anne Elliot	"His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire , the Croft , who rents Kellynch . "" Before Sir Walter had reached this point , Anne 's eyes had caught the right direction , and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance ."
Anne Elliot	As her eyes fell on him , his seemed to be withdrawn from her .
Anne Elliot	It seemed as if she had been one moment too late ; and as long as she dared observe , he did not look again : but the performance was recommencing , and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward .
Anne Elliot	When she could give another glance , he had moved away .
Anne Elliot	He could not have come nearer to her if he would ; she was so surrounded and shut in : but she would rather have caught his eye .
Anne Elliot	Mr Elliot 's speech , too , distressed her .
Anne Elliot	She had no longer any inclination to talk to him . She wished him not so near her .
Anne Elliot	Now she hoped for some beneficial change ; and , after a period of nothing - saying amongst the party , some of them did decide on going in quest of tea . Anne was one of the few who did not choose to move .
Anne Elliot	She remained in her seat , and so did Lady Russell ; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot ; and she did not mean , whatever she might feel on Lady Russell 's account , to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth , if he gave her the opportunity .
Anne Elliot	She was persuaded by Lady Russell 's countenance that she had seen him . He did not come however .
Anne Elliot	Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance , but he never came .
Anne Elliot	To Anne , it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation .
Anne Elliot	She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more , without the interchange of one friendly look .
Anne Elliot	In re - settling themselves there were now many changes , the result of which was favourable for her .
Anne Elliot	Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again , and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret , in a manner not to be refused , to sit between them ; and by some other removals , and a little scheming of her own , Anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before , much more within reach of a passer - by .
Anne Elliot	She could not do so , without comparing herself with Miss Larolles , the inimitable Miss Larolles ; but still she did it , and not with much happier effect ; though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours , she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed . Such was her situation , with a vacant space at hand , when Captain Wentworth was again in sight . She saw him not far off .
Anne Elliot	He saw her too ; yet he looked grave , and seemed irresolute , and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her . She felt that something must be the matter . The change was indubitable . The difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room was strikingly great .
Anne Elliot	She thought of her father , of Lady Russell . Could there have been any unpleasant glances ?
Anne Elliot	Anne replied , and spoke in defence of the performance so well , and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly , that his countenance improved , and he replied again with almost a smile .
Anne Elliot	They talked for a few minutes more ; the improvement held ; he even looked down towards the bench , as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying ; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round .
Anne Elliot	He begged her pardon , but she must be applied to , to explain Italian again .
Anne Elliot	Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung . Anne could not refuse ; but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit .
Anne Elliot	A few minutes , though as few as possible , were inevitably consumed ; and when her own mistress again , when able to turn and look as she had done before , she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth , in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell .
Anne Elliot	""" "" Is not this song worth staying for ? "" said Anne , suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging ."
Anne Elliot	Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection !
Anne Elliot	Could she have believed it a week ago ; three hours ago !
Anne Elliot	How , in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations , would he ever learn of her real sentiments ?
Anne Elliot	Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith , meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call ; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object .
Anne Elliot	She felt a great deal of good - will towards him . In spite of the mischief of his attentions , she owed him gratitude and regard , perhaps compassion . She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance , of the right which he seemed to have to interest her , by everything in situation , by his own sentiments , by his early prepossession .
Anne Elliot	How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case , was not worth enquiry ; for there was a Captain Wentworth ; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad , her affection would be his for ever .
Anne Elliot	Their union , she believed , could not divide her more from other men , than their final separation . Prettier musings of high - wrought love and eternal constancy , could never have passed along the streets of Bath , than Anne was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings . It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way .
Anne Elliot	She was sure of a pleasant reception ; and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming , seemed hardly to have expected her , though it had been an appointment .
Anne Elliot	An account of the concert was immediately claimed ; and Anne 's recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it .
Anne Elliot	All that she could tell she told most gladly , but the all was little for one who had been there , and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith ,
Anne Elliot	who had already heard , through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter , rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne could relate , and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company
Anne Elliot	""" Yes ; I did not see them myself , but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in the room . "" "" The Ibbotsons , were they there ?"
Anne Elliot	""" I do not know ."
Anne Elliot	"I do not think they were . "" "" Old Lady Mary Maclean ?"
Anne Elliot	I need not ask after her . She never misses , I know ; and you must have seen her . She must have been in your own circle ; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple , you were in the seats of grandeur , round the orchestra , of course .
Anne Elliot	""" "" No , that was what I dreaded ."
Anne Elliot	It would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect .
Anne Elliot	"But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be farther off ; and we were exceedingly well placed , that is , for hearing ; I must not say for seeing , because I appear to have seen very little . "" "" Oh !"
Anne Elliot	you saw enough for your own amusement .
Anne Elliot	There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd , and this you had .
Anne Elliot	You were a large party in yourselves , and you wanted nothing beyond .
Anne Elliot	""" "" But I ought to have looked about me more , "" said Anne , conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about , that the object only had been deficient ."
Anne Elliot	""" No , no ; you were better employed . You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening ."
Anne Elliot	I see it in your eye .
Anne Elliot	"I perfectly see how the hours passed : that you had always something agreeable to listen to . In the intervals of the concert it was conversation . "" Anne half smiled and said , "" Do you see that in my eye ?"
Anne Elliot	Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world , the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together .
Anne Elliot	A blush overspread Anne 's cheeks .
Anne Elliot	She could say nothing .
Anne Elliot	""" And such being the case , "" continued Mrs Smith , after a short pause , "" I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning ."
Anne Elliot	"It is really very good of you to come and sit with me , when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time . "" Anne heard nothing of this ."
Anne Elliot	"She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend 's penetration , unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her . After another short silence-- "" Pray , "" said Mrs Smith , "" is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ? Does he know that I am in Bath ?"
Anne Elliot	""" Mr Elliot ! "" repeated Anne , looking up surprised ."
Anne Elliot	A moment 's reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under .
Anne Elliot	"She caught it instantaneously ; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety , soon added , more composedly , "" Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot ? """
Anne Elliot	"Had I known it , I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you . "" "" To confess the truth , "" said Mrs Smith , assuming her usual air of cheerfulness , "" that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have ."
Anne Elliot	I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot . I want your interest with him .
Anne Elliot	"He can be of essential service to me ; and if you would have the goodness , my dear Miss Elliot , to make it an object to yourself , of course it is done . """
Anne Elliot	""" I should be extremely happy ; I hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you , "" replied Anne ; "" but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case ."
Anne Elliot	I am sure you have , somehow or other , imbibed such a notion .
Anne Elliot	You must consider me only as Mr Elliot 's relation .
Anne Elliot	"If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me . "" Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance , and then , smiling , said-- "" I have been a little premature , I perceive ; I beg your pardon ."
Anne Elliot	But now , my dear Miss Elliot , as an old friend , do give me a hint as to when I may speak .
Anne Elliot	To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled , and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot 's good fortune .
Anne Elliot	""" "" No , "" replied Anne , "" nor next week , nor next , nor next ."
Anne Elliot	I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week .
Anne Elliot	I am not going to marry Mr Elliot .
Anne Elliot	"I should like to know why you imagine I am ? "" Mrs Smith looked at her again , looked earnestly , smiled , shook her head , and exclaimed-- "" Now , how I do wish I understood you !"
Anne Elliot	How I do wish I knew what you were at !
Anne Elliot	I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel , when the right moment occurs .
Anne Elliot	Till it does come , you know , we women never mean to have anybody . It is a thing of course among us , that every man is refused , till he offers . But why should you be cruel ?
Anne Elliot	Where can you look for a more suitable match ?
Anne Elliot	Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike , agreeable man ? Let me recommend Mr Elliot .
Anne Elliot	I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis ; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis ?
Anne Elliot	""" "" My dear Mrs Smith , Mr Elliot 's wife has not been dead much above half a year . He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one . "" "" Oh !"
Anne Elliot	"if these are your only objections , "" cried Mrs Smith , archly , "" Mr Elliot is safe , and I shall give myself no more trouble about him ."
Anne Elliot	Do not forget me when you are married , that 's all .
Anne Elliot	Let him know me to be a friend of yours , and then he will think little of the trouble required , which it is very natural for him now , with so many affairs and engagements of his own , to avoid and get rid of as he can ; very natural , perhaps .
Anne Elliot	Of course , he can not be aware of the importance to me .
Anne Elliot	Well , my dear Miss Elliot , I hope and trust you will be very happy .
Anne Elliot	Your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been .
Anne Elliot	You are safe in all worldly matters , and safe in his character .
Anne Elliot	""" "" No , "" said Anne , "" I can readily believe all that of my cousin . He seems to have a calm decided temper , not at all open to dangerous impressions ."
Anne Elliot	I consider him with great respect .
Anne Elliot	I have no reason , from any thing that has fallen within my observation , to do otherwise .
Anne Elliot	But I have not known him long ; and he is not a man , I think , to be known intimately soon .
Anne Elliot	Will not this manner of speaking of him , Mrs Smith , convince you that he is nothing to me ?
Anne Elliot	And , upon my word , he is nothing to me .
Anne Elliot	Should he ever propose to me ( which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing ) , I shall not accept him .
Anne Elliot	I assure you I shall not .
Anne Elliot	"I assure you , Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing , in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford : not Mr Elliot ; it is not Mr Elliot that-- "" She stopped , regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much ; but less would hardly have been sufficient ."
Anne Elliot	Mrs Smith would hardly have believed so soon in Mr Elliot 's failure , but from the perception of there being a somebody else . As it was , she instantly submitted , and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond ; and Anne , eager to escape farther notice , was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot ; where she could have received the idea , or from whom she could have heard it .
Anne Elliot	""" Do tell me how it first came into your head ."
Anne Elliot	""" "" It first came into my head , "" replied Mrs Smith , "" upon finding how much you were together , and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you ; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way ."
Anne Elliot	""" And has it indeed been spoken of ? "" "" Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday ? "" "" No ."
Anne Elliot	"I observed no one in particular . "" "" It was my friend Mrs Rooke ; Nurse Rooke ; who , by - the - bye , had a great curiosity to see you , and was delighted to be in the way to let you in . She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday ; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot . She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself , which did not seem bad authority ."
Anne Elliot	"She sat an hour with me on Monday evening , and gave me the whole history . "" "" The whole history , "" repeated Anne , laughing ."
Anne Elliot	""" She could not make a very long history , I think , of one such little article of unfounded news ."
Anne Elliot	""" But , "" continued Anne , presently , "" though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot , I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could ."
Anne Elliot	Shall I mention to him your being in Bath ?
Anne Elliot	"Shall I take any message ? "" """
Anne Elliot	No , I thank you : no , certainly not .
Anne Elliot	In the warmth of the moment , and under a mistaken impression , I might , perhaps , have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances ; but not now .
Anne Elliot	No , I thank you , I have nothing to trouble you with .
Anne Elliot	""" I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years ?"
Anne Elliot	""" I did . """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes ; he was not married when I knew him first ."
Anne Elliot	""" And -- were you much acquainted ? "" "" Intimately . "" "" Indeed !"
Anne Elliot	Then do tell me what he was at that time of life .
Anne Elliot	I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man .
Anne Elliot	""" "" I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years , "" was Mrs Smith 's answer , given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther ; and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity ."
Anne Elliot	"At last-- "" I beg your pardon , my dear Miss Elliot , "" she cried , in her natural tone of cordiality , "" I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you , but I have been uncertain what I ought to do ."
Anne Elliot	I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you .
Anne Elliot	However , I have determined ; I think I am right ; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot 's real character .
Anne Elliot	Though I fully believe that , at present , you have not the smallest intention of accepting him , there is no saying what may happen .
Anne Elliot	You might , some time or other , be differently affected towards him .
Anne Elliot	Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced .
Anne Elliot	"Anne 's astonished air , and exclamation of wonder , made her pause , and in a calmer manner , she added , "" My expressions startle you ."
Anne Elliot	You must allow for an injured , angry woman .
Anne Elliot	But I will try to command myself . I will not abuse him .
Anne Elliot	He was the intimate friend of my dear husband , who trusted and loved him , and thought him as good as himself .
Anne Elliot	At nineteen , you know , one does not think very seriously ; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others , and much more agreeable than most others , and we were almost always together .
Anne Elliot	"My poor Charles , who had the finest , most generous spirit in the world , would have divided his last farthing with him ; and I know that his purse was open to him ; I know that he often assisted him . """
Anne Elliot	""" This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot 's life , "" said Anne , "" which has always excited my particular curiosity ."
Anne Elliot	It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister . I never knew him myself ; I only heard of him ; but there was a something in his conduct then , with regard to my father and sister , and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage , which I never could quite reconcile with present times .
Anne Elliot	""" He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him , but I heard him speak of them for ever ."
Anne Elliot	I can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , I knew all about it at the time .
Anne Elliot	"though I did not know his wife previously , her inferior situation in society , indeed , rendered that impossible , yet I knew her all her life afterwards , or at least till within the last two years of her life , and can answer any question you may wish to put . "" "" Nay , "" said Anne , "" I have no particular enquiry to make about her . I have always understood they were not a happy couple . But I should like to know why , at that time of his life , he should slight my father 's acquaintance as he did . My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him . Why did Mr Elliot draw back ?"
Anne Elliot	He was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and I know it was his belief ( whether justly or not , of course I can not decide ) , that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence .
Anne Elliot	That was his motive for drawing back , I can assure you .
Anne Elliot	He had no concealments with me .
Anne Elliot	It was curious , that having just left you behind me in Bath , my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin ; and that , through him , I should be continually hearing of your father and sister . He described one Miss Elliot , and I thought very affectionately of the other .
Anne Elliot	""" Perhaps , "" cried Anne , struck by a sudden idea , "" you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot ?"
Anne Elliot	"I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot , and vouch for your being a very different creature from-- "" She checked herself just in time ."
Anne Elliot	""" This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night , "" cried Anne ."
Anne Elliot	I found he had been used to hear of me .
Anne Elliot	I could not comprehend how .
Anne Elliot	I think differently now ; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions ; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing .
Anne Elliot	"It would not be fair ; and yet you ought to have proof , for what is all this but assertion , and you shall have proof . """
Anne Elliot	""" Indeed , my dear Mrs Smith , I want none , "" cried Anne ."
Anne Elliot	""" You have asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago ."
Anne Elliot	"I am more curious to know why he should be so different now . "" "" But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary ; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . """
Anne Elliot	Anne , seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it , did as she was desired .
Anne Elliot	"The box was brought and placed before her , and Mrs Smith , sighing over it as she unlocked it , said-- "" This is full of papers belonging to him , to my husband ; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him ."
Anne Elliot	""" I wish I had any name but Elliot ."
Anne Elliot	I am sick of it .
Anne Elliot	The name of Walter I can drop , thank God !
Anne Elliot	"and I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again , meaning , for the rest of my life , to be only yours truly,--Wm . Elliot . "" Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow ; and Mrs Smith , observing the high colour in her face , said-- "" The language , I know , is highly disrespectful . Though I have forgot the exact terms , I have a perfect impression of the general meaning ."
Anne Elliot	But it shows you the man .
Anne Elliot	Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father .
Anne Elliot	"She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour , that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies , that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others , before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over , and say-- "" Thank you ."
Anne Elliot	Mr Elliot 's having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father .
Anne Elliot	That was all prior to my coming to Bath . I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived .
Anne Elliot	You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due , by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm .
Anne Elliot	Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement .
Anne Elliot	He had seen you indeed , before he came to Bath , and admired you , but without knowing it to be you .
Anne Elliot	"Did he see you last summer or autumn , ` somewhere down in the west , ' to use her own words , without knowing it to be you ? "" "" He certainly did ."
Anne Elliot	I happened to be at Lyme .
Anne Elliot	He saw you then at Lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place , as Miss Anne Elliot , and from that moment , I have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there .
Anne Elliot	But there was another , and an earlier , which I will now explain . If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable , stop me .
Anne Elliot	"My account states , that your sister 's friend , the lady now staying with you , whom I have heard you mention , came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September ( in short when they first came themselves ) , and has been staying there ever since ; that she is a clever , insinuating , handsome woman , poor and plausible , and altogether such in situation and manner , as to give a general idea , among Sir Walter 's acquaintance , of her meaning to be Lady Elliot , and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently , blind to the danger . """
Anne Elliot	"Here Mrs Smith paused a moment ; but Anne had not a word to say , and she continued-- "" This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family , long before you returned to it ; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it , though he did not then visit in Camden Place ; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there , and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two , as he happened to do a little before Christmas , Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things , and the reports beginning to prevail ."
Anne Elliot	Now you are to understand , that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot 's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy .
Anne Elliot	This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done ; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could . He was to be introduced , and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced , and everybody was to be introduced .
Anne Elliot	Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re - admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ) , to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject .
Anne Elliot	""" "" Yes , "" said Anne , "" you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known , or could imagine ."
Anne Elliot	The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting , but I have heard nothing which really surprises me .
Anne Elliot	Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea , as nurse tells me , that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry , that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay .
Anne Elliot	A scheme , worthy of Mrs Wallis 's understanding , by all accounts ; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it .
Anne Elliot	And , indeed , to own the truth , I do not think nurse , in her heart , is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter 's making a second match . She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony , you know ; and ( since self will intrude ) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot , through Mrs Wallis 's recommendation ?
Anne Elliot	""" "" I am very glad to know all this , "" said Anne , after a little thoughtfulness ."
Anne Elliot	""" It will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him , but I shall know better what to do ."
Anne Elliot	My line of conduct will be more direct .
Anne Elliot	Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion . She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot 's marriage ) they had been as before always together , and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune .
Anne Elliot	Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself , and was most tender of throwing any on her husband ; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living , and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance . From his wife 's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings , easy temper , careless habits , and not strong understanding , much more amiable than his friend , and very unlike him , led by him , and probably despised by him .
Anne Elliot	With a confidence in Mr Elliot 's regard , more creditable to his feelings than his judgement , Mr Smith had appointed him the executor of his will ; but Mr Elliot would not act , and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her , in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation , had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit , or listened to without corresponding indignation .
Anne Elliot	Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion , answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith , which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble , and , under a cold civility , the same hard - hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her .
Anne Elliot	It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity ; and Anne felt , at some moments , that no flagrant open crime could have been worse .
Anne Elliot	She had a great deal to listen to ; all the particulars of past sad scenes , all the minutiae of distress upon distress , which in former conversations had been merely hinted at , were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence
Anne Elliot	Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief , and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend 's usual state of mind .
Anne Elliot	There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation .
Anne Elliot	She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies , which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances , might be recoverable by proper measures ; and this property , though not large , would be enough to make her comparatively rich .
Anne Elliot	Mr Elliot would do nothing , and she could do nothing herself , equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness , and from employing others by her want of money .
Anne Elliot	She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel , and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law .
Anne Elliot	To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances , that a little trouble in the right place might do it , and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims , was hard to bear . It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne 's good offices with Mr Elliot .
Anne Elliot	She had previously , in the anticipation of their marriage , been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it ; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature , since he did not even know her to be in Bath , it immediately occurred , that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved , and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne 's feelings , as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot 's character would allow , when Anne 's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything ; and while it took from her the new - formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety , left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way . After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot , Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith 's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation .
Anne Elliot	""" My dear , "" was Mrs Smith 's reply , "" there was nothing else to be done ."
Anne Elliot	I considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and I could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband .
Anne Elliot	My heart bled for you , as I talked of happiness ; and yet he is sensible , he is agreeable , and with such a woman as you , it was not absolutely hopeless .
Anne Elliot	I was willing to hope that you must fare better .
Anne Elliot	""" Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed . It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell !"
Anne Elliot	It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived ; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference , which carried them through the greater part of the morning , was , that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Smith , in which his conduct was involved .
Anne Elliot	"Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in Cheshire ; how mentioned in Dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of Charles II , with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto:--""Principal seat , Kellynch Hall , in the county of Somerset , "" and Sir Walter 's handwriting again in this finale:-- "" Heir presumptive , William Walter Elliot , Esq . , great grandson of the second Sir Walter . """
Anne Elliot	He had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty - four , was still a very fine man .
Anne Elliot	--Three girls , the two eldest sixteen and fourteen , was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath , an awful charge rather , to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited , silly father . She had , however , one very intimate friend , a sensible , deserving woman , who had been brought , by strong attachment to herself , to settle close by her , in the village of Kellynch ; and on her kindness and advice , Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters .
Anne Elliot	This friend , and Sir Walter , did not marry , whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance . Thirteen years
Anne Elliot	had passed away since Lady Elliot 's death , and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends , and one remained a widower , the other a widow .
Anne Elliot	That Lady Russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again , than when she does not ; but Sir Walter 's continuing in singleness requires explanation .
Anne Elliot	her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ) , there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem .
Anne Elliot	He had never indulged much hope , he had now none , of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work .
Anne Elliot	All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably .
Anne Elliot	Anne haggard , Mary coarse , every face in the neighbourhood worsting , and the rapid increase of the crow 's foot about Lady Russell 's temples had long been a distress to him .
Anne Elliot	Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment .
Anne Elliot	Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall , presiding and directing with a self - possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was . For thirteen years had she been doing the honours , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing - rooms and dining - rooms in the country .
Anne Elliot	Thirteen winters ' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded , and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms , as she travelled up to London with her father , for a few weeks ' annual enjoyment of the great world . She had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine - and - twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions ; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever , but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet - blood within the next twelvemonth or two . Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth , but now she liked it not .
Anne Elliot	The following spring he was seen again in town , found equally agreeable , again encouraged , invited , and expected , and again he did not come ; and the next tidings were that he was married . Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot , he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth .
Anne Elliot	She felt herself ill - used and unfortunate , as did her father ; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity , or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne .
Anne Elliot	There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of ; but had every acre been alienable , it would have made no difference .
Anne Elliot	Their two confidential friends , Mr Shepherd , who lived in the neighbouring market town , and Lady Russell , were called to advise them ; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure , without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride .
Anne Elliot	17 While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in Laura Place , Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description .
Anne Elliot	She had called on her former governess , and had heard from her of there being an old school - fellow in Bath , who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering .
Anne Elliot	Anne had gone unhappy to school , grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved , feeling her separation from home , and suffering as a girl of fourteen , of strong sensibility and not high spirits , must suffer at such a time ; and Miss Hamilton , three years older than herself , but still from the want of near relations and a settled home , remaining another year at school , had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery , and could never be remembered with indifference .
Anne Elliot	Miss Hamilton had left school , had married not long afterwards , was said to have married a man of fortune , and this was all that Anne had known of her , till now that their governess 's account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form .
Anne Elliot	Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith , and Anne therefore lost no time in going .
Anne Elliot	She mentioned nothing of what she had heard , or what she intended , at home .
Anne Elliot	She only consulted Lady Russell , who entered thoroughly into her sentiments , and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith 's lodgings in Westgate Buildings , as Anne chose to be taken . The visit was paid , their acquaintance re - established , their interest in each other more than re - kindled .
Anne Elliot	Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming , silent , unformed girl of fifteen , to the elegant little woman of seven - and - twenty , with every beauty except bloom , and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle ; and twelve years had transformed the fine - looking , well - grown Miss Hamilton , in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority , into a poor , infirm , helpless widow , receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour ; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away , and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times .
Anne Elliot	Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on , and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation .
Anne Elliot	Neither the dissipations of the past -- and she had lived very much in the world -- nor the restrictions of the present , neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits . In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness , and Anne 's astonishment increased .
Anne Elliot	She could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith 's .
Anne Elliot	She had been very fond of her husband : she had buried him . She had been used to affluence : it was gone .
Anne Elliot	She had no child to connect her with life and happiness again , no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs , no health to make all the rest supportable .
Anne Elliot	Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour , and a dark bedroom behind , with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance , which there was only one servant in the house to afford , and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath .
Anne Elliot	Yet , in spite of all this , Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression , to hours of occupation and enjoyment .
Anne Elliot	She watched , observed , reflected , and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only . A submissive spirit might be patient , a strong understanding would supply resolution , but here was something more ; here was that elasticity of mind , that disposition to be comforted , that power of turning readily from evil to good , and of finding employment which carried her out of herself , which was from nature alone .
Anne Elliot	It was the choicest gift of Heaven ; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which , by a merciful appointment , it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want .
Anne Elliot	Call it gossip , if you will , but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour 's leisure to bestow on me , she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable : something that makes one know one 's species better .
Anne Elliot	"To me , who live so much alone , her conversation , I assure you , is a treat . """
Anne Elliot	"Anne , far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure , replied , "" I can easily believe it ."
Anne Elliot	""" "" Yes , "" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly , "" sometimes it may , though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe ."
Anne Elliot	Anne saw the misery of such feelings .
Anne Elliot	Anne had called several times on her friend , before the existence of such a person was known in Camden Place . At last , it became necessary to speak of her .
Anne Elliot	Sir Walter , Elizabeth and Mrs Clay , returned one morning from Laura Place , with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening , and Anne was already engaged , to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings .
Anne Elliot	"They were not much interested in anything relative to Anne ; but still there were questions enough asked , to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was ; and Elizabeth was disdainful , and Sir Walter severe . "" Westgate Buildings ! "" said he , "" and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be visiting in Westgate Buildings ?"
Anne Elliot	Upon my word , Miss Anne Elliot , you have the most extraordinary taste !
Anne Elliot	Everything that revolts other people , low company , paltry rooms , foul air , disgusting associations are inviting to you .
Anne Elliot	But surely you may put off this old lady till to - morrow : she is not so near her end , I presume , but that she may hope to see another day .
Anne Elliot	""" But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance ? "" asked Elizabeth ."
Anne Elliot	""" She sees nothing to blame in it , "" replied Anne ; "" on the contrary , she approves it , and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs Smith ."
Anne Elliot	""" Sir Henry Russell 's widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot . A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings ! A poor widow barely able to live , between thirty and forty ; a mere Mrs Smith , an every - day Mrs Smith , of all people and all names in the world , to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot , and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland ! Mrs Smith !"
Anne Elliot	Mrs Clay , who had been present while all this passed , now thought it advisable to leave the room , and Anne could have said much , and did long to say a little in defence of her friend 's not very dissimilar claims to theirs , but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her .
Anne Elliot	She made no reply .
Anne Elliot	She left it to himself to recollect , that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty , with little to live on , and no surname of dignity .
Anne Elliot	Anne kept her appointment ; the others kept theirs , and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening .
Anne Elliot	She had been the only one of the set absent , for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship 's service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot ; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early , and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her . Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell .
Anne Elliot	To her , its greatest interest must be , in having been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot ; in having been wished for , regretted , and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause .
Anne Elliot	Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot . He thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence . He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits ; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend , could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man , without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create . Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot .
Anne Elliot	She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her , and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood , and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing .
Anne Elliot	She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject , she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter , of a possible attachment on his side , of the desirableness of the alliance , supposing such attachment to be real and returned .
Anne Elliot	"Anne heard her , and made no violent exclamations ; she only smiled , blushed , and gently shook her head . "" I am no match - maker , as you well know , "" said Lady Russell , "" being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations ."
Anne Elliot	I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together .
Anne Elliot	""" Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man , and in many respects I think highly of him , "" said Anne ; "" but we should not suit . """
Anne Elliot	"Lady Russell let this pass , and only said in rejoinder , "" I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother 's place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me . You are your mother 's self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued ! My dearest Anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! """
Anne Elliot	Anne was obliged to turn away , to rise , to walk to a distant table , and , leaning there in pretended employment , try to subdue the feelings this picture excited .
Anne Elliot	For a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched .
Anne Elliot	"The idea of becoming what her mother had been ; of having the precious name of "" Lady Elliot "" first revived in herself ; of being restored to Kellynch , calling it her home again , her home for ever , was a charm which she could not immediately resist . Lady Russell said not another word , willing to leave the matter to its own operation ; and believing that , could Mr Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed , in short , what Anne did not believe ."
Anne Elliot	The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself brought Anne to composure again .
Anne Elliot	She never could accept him .
Anne Elliot	And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one ; her judgement , on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against Mr Elliot .
Anne Elliot	Though they had now been acquainted a month , she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character .
Anne Elliot	He certainly knew what was right , nor could she fix
Anne Elliot	on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed ; but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct .
Anne Elliot	She distrusted the past , if not the present .
Anne Elliot	She saw that there had been bad habits ; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing ; that there had been a period of his life ( and probably not a short one ) when he had been , at least , careless in all serious matters ; and , though he might now think very differently , who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever , cautious man , grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ? How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ? Mr Elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open . There was never any burst of feeling , any warmth of indignation or delight , at the evil or good of others . This , to Anne , was a decided imperfection .
Anne Elliot	Her early impressions were incurable .
Anne Elliot	She prized the frank , the open - hearted , the eager character beyond all others .
Anne Elliot	Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still .
Anne Elliot	She felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing , than of those whose presence of mind never varied , whose tongue never slipped .
Anne Elliot	Various as were the tempers in her father 's house , he pleased them all .
Anne Elliot	He had spoken to her with some degree of openness of Mrs Clay ; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was about , and to hold her in contempt ; and yet Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body . Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend , for she saw nothing to excite distrust . She could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot ; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church , in the course of the following autumn .
Anne Elliot	14 Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge . They had left Louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them . They had been all in lodgings together .
Anne Elliot	Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme . She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight . Anne enquired after Captain Benwick , Mary 's face was clouded directly . Charles laughed .
Anne Elliot	: Charles undertook to give him some shooting , and he seemed quite delighted , and , for my part , I thought it was all settled ; when behold ! on Tuesday night , he made a very awkward sort of excuse ; ` he never shot ' and he had ` been quite misunderstood , ' and he had promised this and he had promised that , and the end of it was , I found , that he did not mean to come .
Anne Elliot	I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull ; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart - broken man as Captain Benwick .
Anne Elliot	"Charles laughed again and said , "" Now Mary , you know very well how it really was ."
Anne Elliot	"It was all your doing , "" ( turning to Anne . )"
Anne Elliot	""" He fancied that if he went with us , he should find you close by : he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross ; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off , his heart failed him ,"
Anne Elliot	and he had not courage to come . That is the fact , upon my honour , Mary knows it is .
Anne Elliot	""" But Mary did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot , or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed . Anne 's good - will , however , was not to be lessened by what she heard . She boldly acknowledged herself flattered , and continued her enquiries . "" Oh !"
Anne Elliot	"he talks of you , "" cried Charles , "" in such terms-- "" Mary interrupted him ."
Anne Elliot	""" I declare , Charles , I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there ."
Anne Elliot	"I declare , Anne , he never talks of you at all . "" "" No , "" admitted Charles , "" I do not know that he ever does , in a general way ; but however , it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly ."
Anne Elliot	His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation , and he wants to talk to you about them ; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks -- oh !
Anne Elliot	Now Mary , I declare it was so , I heard it myself , and you were in the other room .
Anne Elliot	""" "" And I am sure , "" cried Mary , warmly , "" it was a very little to his credit , if he did ."
Anne Elliot	Miss Harville only died last June . Such a heart is very little worth having ; is it , Lady Russell ?
Anne Elliot	I am sure you will agree with me .
Anne Elliot	""" I must see Captain Benwick before I decide , "" said Lady Russell , smiling . "" And that you are very likely to do very soon , I can tell you , ma'am , """
Anne Elliot	""" Though he had not nerves for coming away with us , and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here , he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself , you may depend on it ."
Anne Elliot	I told him the distance and the road , and I told him of the church 's being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , I thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon .
Anne Elliot	So , I give you notice , Lady Russell .
Anne Elliot	""" "" Any acquaintance of Anne 's will always be welcome to me , "" was Lady Russell 's kind answer ."
Anne Elliot	"as to being Anne 's acquaintance , "" said Mary , "" I think he is rather my acquaintance , for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight ."
Anne Elliot	""" "" Well , as your joint acquaintance , then , I shall be very happy to see Captain Benwick . "" "" You will not find anything very agreeable in him , I assure you , ma'am ."
Anne Elliot	I am sure you will not like him .
Anne Elliot	""" "" There we differ , Mary , "" said Anne ."
Anne Elliot	""" I think Lady Russell would like him ."
Anne Elliot	I think she would be so much pleased with his mind , that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner .
Anne Elliot	""" "" So do I , Anne , "" said Charles ."
Anne Elliot	""" I am sure Lady Russell would like him ."
Anne Elliot	He is just Lady Russell 's sort .
Anne Elliot	""" "" Yes , that he will ! "" exclaimed Mary , tauntingly ."
Anne Elliot	""" He will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drop 's one 's scissors , or anything that happens . Do you think Lady Russell would like that ? "" Lady Russell could not help laughing ."
Anne Elliot	""" Upon my word , "" said she , "" I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture , steady and matter of fact as I may call myself ."
Anne Elliot	I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions .
Anne Elliot	I wish he may be induced to call here .
Anne Elliot	"And when he does , Mary , you may depend upon hearing my opinion ; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand . "" "" You will not like him , I will answer for it . "" Lady Russell began talking of something else ."
Anne Elliot	Mary spoke with animation of their meeting with , or rather missing , Mr Elliot so extraordinarily .
Anne Elliot	""" He is a man , "" said Lady Russell , "" whom I have no wish to see ."
Anne Elliot	"His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family , has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me . "" This decision checked Mary 's eagerness , and stopped her short in the midst of the Elliot countenance ."
Anne Elliot	With regard to Captain Wentworth , though Anne hazarded no enquiries , there was voluntary communication sufficient .
Anne Elliot	His spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected .
Anne Elliot	As Louisa improved , he had improved , and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week .
Anne Elliot	He had not seen Louisa ; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview , that he did not press for it at all ; and , on the contrary , seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days , till her head was stronger .
Anne Elliot	He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week , and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him ; but , as Charles maintained to the last , Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch . There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick , from this time . Lady Russell could not hear the door - bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father 's grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him . Captain Benwick came not , however .
Anne Elliot	He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined , or he was too shy ; and after giving him a week 's indulgence , Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite . The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school , bringing with them Mrs Harville 's little children , to improve the noise of Uppercross , and lessen that of Lyme .
Anne Elliot	Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once , when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again .
Anne Elliot	Though neither Henrietta , nor Louisa , nor Charles Hayter , nor Captain Wentworth were there , the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in .
Anne Elliot	Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them . On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others . Charles and Mary also came in , of course , during their visit , and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell , and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain .
Anne Elliot	Anne , judging from her own temperament , would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves , which Louisa 's illness must have so greatly shaken .
Anne Elliot	But Mrs Musgrove , who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially , again and again , for all her attentions to them , concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing , with a happy glance round the room , that after all she had gone through , nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home .
Anne Elliot	"Captain Wentworth was gone , for the present , to see his brother in Shropshire . """
Anne Elliot	"I hope I shall remember , in future , "" said Lady Russell , as soon as they were reseated in the carriage , "" not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays ."
Anne Elliot	When Lady Russell not long afterwards , was entering Bath on a wet afternoon , and driving through the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place , amidst the dash of other carriages , the heavy rumble of carts and drays , the bawling of newspapermen , muffin - men and milkmen , and the ceaseless clink of pattens , she made no complaint .
Anne Elliot	Anne did not share these feelings . She persisted in a very determined , though very silent disinclination for Bath ; caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings , smoking in rain , without any wish of seeing them better ; felt their progress through the streets to be , however disagreeable , yet too rapid ; for who would be glad to see her when she arrived ?
Anne Elliot	"This was very wonderful if it were true ; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot , already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary , of his being "" a man whom she had no wish to see . """
Anne Elliot	She had a great wish to see him .
Anne Elliot	If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch , he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree . Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance , but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not , which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath .
Anne Elliot	She was put down in Camden Place ; and Lady Russell then drove to her own lodgings , in Rivers Street .
Anne Elliot	Anne went home to think over all that she had heard .
Anne Elliot	In one point , her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot .
Anne Elliot	In every other respect , in looking around her , or penetrating forward , she saw more to distrust and to apprehend .
Anne Elliot	She was concerned for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling ; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister , and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils , without knowing how to avert any one of them . She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him .
Anne Elliot	She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith , but here was a reward indeed springing from it !
Anne Elliot	Mrs Smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done .
Anne Elliot	Could the knowledge have been extended through her family ?
Anne Elliot	She must talk to Lady Russell , tell her , consult with her , and having done her best , wait the event with as much composure as possible ; and after all , her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell ; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself .
Anne Elliot	She found , on reaching home , that she had , as she intended , escaped seeing Mr Elliot ; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit ; but hardly had she congratulated herself , and felt safe , when she heard that he was coming again in the evening .
Anne Elliot	""" "" Quite delightful ! "" cried Mrs Clay , not daring , however , to turn her eyes towards Anne ."
Anne Elliot	If you will have such ideas !
Anne Elliot	I did invite him , you know .
Anne Elliot	Anne admired the good acting of the friend , in being able to shew such pleasure as she did , in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object .
Anne Elliot	To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room ; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her .
Anne Elliot	She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere , but now she saw insincerity in everything .
Anne Elliot	His attentive deference to her father , contrasted with his former language , was odious ; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith , she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness , or the sound of his artificial good sentiments . She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side . It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat ; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship ; and to retrace , as quietly as she could , the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along . She was accordingly more guarded , and more cool , than she had been the night before .
Anne Elliot	It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her ; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party , seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort . It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and Elizabeth ; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them ! Mrs Clay 's selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his ; and Anne would have compounded for the marriage at once , with all its evils , to be clear of Mr Elliot 's subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it .
Anne Elliot	On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell , and accomplish the necessary communication ; and she would have gone directly after breakfast , but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble , which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion . She saw Mrs Clay fairly off , therefore , before she began to talk of spending the morning in Rivers Street .
Anne Elliot	While her father spoke , there was a knock at the door .
Anne Elliot	Anne , remembering the preconcerted visits , at all hours , of Mr Elliot , would have expected him , but for his known engagement seven miles off .
Anne Elliot	"After the usual period of suspense , the usual sounds of approach were heard , and "" Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove "" were ushered into the room . Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance ; but Anne was really glad to see them ; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome ; and as soon as it became clear that these , their nearest relations , were not arrived with an views of accommodation in that house , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality , and do the honours of it very well ."
Anne Elliot	They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove , and were at the White Hart . So much was pretty soon understood ; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing - room , and regaling themselves with her admiration , Anne could not draw upon Charles 's brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary , as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of .
Anne Elliot	She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove , Henrietta , and Captain Harville , beside their two selves .
Anne Elliot	He gave her a very plain , intelligible account of the whole ; a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding .
Anne Elliot	but Mary could not bear to be left , and had made herself so unhappy about it , that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense , or at an end .
Anne Elliot	Anne 's only surprise was , that affairs should be in forwardness enough for Henrietta 's wedding - clothes to be talked of . She had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand ; but she learned from Charles that , very recently , ( since Mary 's last letter to herself ) , Charles Hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years ; and that on the strength of his present income , with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question , the two families had consented to the young people 's wishes , and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months , quite as soon as Louisa 's .
Anne Elliot	""" I am extremely glad , indeed , "" cried Anne , "" particularly glad that this should happen ; and that of two sisters , who both deserve equally well , and who have always been such good friends , the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other-- that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort . I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both ."
Anne Elliot	My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer , but he has no other fault to find .
Anne Elliot	Money , you know , coming down with money -- two daughters at once -- it can not be a very agreeable operation , and it streightens him as to many things .
Anne Elliot	However , I do not mean to say they have not a right to it .
Anne Elliot	It is very fit they should have daughters ' shares ; and I am sure he has always been a very kind , liberal father to me .
Anne Elliot	She never did , you know .
Anne Elliot	"I can not make her attend to the value of the property . It is a very fair match , as times go ; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life , and I shall not leave off now . "" "" Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove , "" exclaimed Anne , "" should be happy in their children 's marriages . They do everything to confer happiness , I am sure ."
Anne Elliot	"Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ? "" He answered rather hesitatingly , "" Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different . If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab - chick in the water ; and Benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long ."
Anne Elliot	Anne could not help laughing .
Anne Elliot	""" That can not be much to your taste , I know , "" said she ; "" but I do believe him to be an excellent young man ."
Anne Elliot	Nobody doubts it ; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself .
Anne Elliot	I have a great value for Benwick ; and when one can but get him to talk , he has plenty to say .
Anne Elliot	I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before .
Anne Elliot	"We had a famous set - to at rat - hunting all the morning in my father 's great barns ; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since . """
Anne Elliot	Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles 's following the others to admire mirrors and china ; but Anne had heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross , and rejoice in its happiness ; and though she sighed as she rejoiced , her sigh had none of the ill - will of envy in it .
Anne Elliot	She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could , but she did not want to lessen theirs .
Anne Elliot	"These were her internal persuasions : "" Old fashioned notions ; country hospitality ; we do not profess to give dinners ; few people in Bath do ; Lady Alicia never does ; did not even ask her own sister 's family , though they were here a month : and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove ; put her quite out of her way ."
Anne Elliot	I am sure she would rather not come ; she can not feel easy with us .
Anne Elliot	I will ask them all for an evening ; that will be much better ; that will be a novelty and a treat .
Anne Elliot	Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning ; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary , to go and see her and Henrietta directly . Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present .
Anne Elliot	They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes ; but Anne convinced herself that a day 's delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence , and hastened forward to the White Hart , to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn , with an eagerness of good - will which many associations contributed to form .
Anne Elliot	They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within , and by themselves , and Anne had the kindest welcome from each .
Anne Elliot	It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on Charles 's leaving them together , was listening to Mrs Musgrove 's history of Louisa , and to Henrietta 's of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which Mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill - used by anybody ; which Mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining .
Anne Elliot	A large party in an hotel ensured a quick - changing , unsettled scene . One five minutes brought a note , the next a parcel ; and Anne had not been there half an hour , when their dining - room , spacious as it was , seemed more than half filled : a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove , and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth .
Anne Elliot	It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again .
Anne Elliot	Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings ; she had derived from it a delightful conviction ; but she feared from his looks , that the same unfortunate persuasion , which had hastened him away from the Concert Room , still governed .
Anne Elliot	"She tried to be calm , and leave things to take their course , and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:-- "" Surely , if there be constant attachment on each side , our hearts must understand each other ere long ."
Anne Elliot	And yet , a few minutes afterwards , she felt as if their being in company with each other , under their present circumstances , could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind .
Anne Elliot	""" Anne , "" cried Mary , still at her window , "" there is Mrs Clay , I am sure , standing under the colonnade , and a gentleman with her ."
Anne Elliot	"It is Mr Elliot himself . "" "" No , "" cried Anne , quickly , "" it can not be Mr Elliot , I assure you ."
Anne Elliot	"He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to - morrow . "" As she spoke , she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her , the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her , and made her regret that she had said so much , simple as it was . Mary , resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin , began talking very warmly about the family features , and protesting still more positively that it was Mr Elliot , calling again upon Anne to come and look for herself , but Anne did not mean to stir , and tried to be cool and unconcerned ."
Anne Elliot	Her distress returned , however , on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors , as if they believed themselves quite in the secret . It was evident that the report concerning her had spread , and a short pause succeeded , which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther .
Anne Elliot	""" Do come , Anne "" cried Mary , "" come and look yourself ."
Anne Elliot	You will be too late if you do not make haste .
Anne Elliot	You seem to have forgot all about Lyme .
Anne Elliot	""" To pacify Mary , and perhaps screen her own embarrassment , Anne did move quietly to the window ."
Anne Elliot	"She was just in time to ascertain that it really was Mr Elliot , which she had never believed , before he disappeared on one side , as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other ; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest , she calmly said , "" Yes , it is Mr Elliot , certainly . He has changed his hour of going , I suppose , that is all , or I may be mistaken , I might not attend ; "" and walked back to her chair , recomposed , and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well ."
Anne Elliot	Anne will not be sorry to join us , I am sure .
Anne Elliot	Consider , my father 's heir : the future representative of the family .
Anne Elliot	The careless expression was life to Anne , who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention , looking and listening with his whole soul ; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself . Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style ; he , half serious and half jesting , maintaining the scheme for the play , and she , invariably serious , most warmly opposing it , and not omitting to make it known that , however determined to go to Camden Place herself , she should not think herself very well used , if they went to the play without her . Mrs Musgrove interposed .
Anne Elliot	"It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father 's ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us . """
Anne Elliot	"Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness ; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying-- "" If it depended only on my inclination , ma'am , the party at home ( excepting on Mary 's account ) would not be the smallest impediment ."
Anne Elliot	I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you .
Anne Elliot	She had spoken it ; but she trembled when it was done , conscious that her words were listened to , and daring not even to try to observe their effect .
Anne Elliot	Captain Wentworth left his seat , and walked to the fire - place ; probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards , and taking a station , with less bare - faced design , by Anne .
Anne Elliot	""" You have not been long enough in Bath , "" said he , "" to enjoy the evening parties of the place . "" "" Oh !"
Anne Elliot	The usual character of them has nothing for me .
Anne Elliot	I am no card - player .
Anne Elliot	""" "" You were not formerly , I know . You did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes ."
Anne Elliot	""" I am not yet so much changed , "" cried Anne , and stopped , fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction ."
Anne Elliot	Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne 's imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour ; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered , she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta , eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out , and calling on her companions to lose no time , lest somebody else should come in .
Anne Elliot	Anne talked of being perfectly ready , and tried to look it ; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair , in preparing to quit the room , she would have found , in all her own sensations for her cousin , in the very security of his affection , wherewith to pity her . Their preparations , however , were stopped short .
Anne Elliot	Anne felt an instant oppression , and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same .
Anne Elliot	The comfort , the freedom , the gaiety of the room was over , hushed into cold composure , determined silence , or insipid talk , to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister . How mortifying to feel that it was so !
Anne Elliot	Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular .
Anne Elliot	The interruption had been short , though severe , and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out , but not to Anne . She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed , and of the manner in which it had been received ; a manner of doubtful meaning , of surprise rather than gratification , of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance . She knew him ; she saw disdain in his eye , and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering , as an atonement for all the insolence of the past . Her spirits sank .
Anne Elliot	"You see he can not put the card out of his hand . """
Anne Elliot	Anne caught his eye , saw his cheeks glow , and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt , and turned away , that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her .
Anne Elliot	The gentlemen had their own pursuits , the ladies proceeded on their own business , and they met no more while Anne belonged to them .
Anne Elliot	She was earnestly begged to return and dine , and give them all the rest of the day , but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more , and fit only for home , where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose .
Anne Elliot	Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning , therefore , she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place , there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow 's party , the frequent enumeration of the persons invited , and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath , while harassing herself with the never - ending question , of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not ?
Anne Elliot	They were reckoning him as certain , but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together .
Anne Elliot	She generally thought he would come , because she generally thought he ought ; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion , as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings .
Anne Elliot	She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation , to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath , for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself , she determined to mention it , and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs Clay 's face as she listened .
Anne Elliot	It was transient : cleared away in an instant ; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having , by some complication of mutual trick , or some overbearing authority of his , been obliged to attend ( perhaps for half an hour ) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter .
Anne Elliot	"She exclaimed , however , with a very tolerable imitation of nature : -- "" Oh !"
Anne Elliot	Only think , Miss Elliot , to my great surprise I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street .
Anne Elliot	I was never more astonished .
Anne Elliot	He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard .
Anne Elliot	He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return .
Anne Elliot	He was full of ` to - morrow , ' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have
Anne Elliot	entirely out of my head
Anne Elliot	She had a cultivated mind , and was , generally speaking , rational and consistent ; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry ; she had a value for rank and consequence , which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them . Herself the widow of only a knight , she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due ; and Sir Walter , independent of his claims as an old acquaintance , an attentive neighbour , an obliging landlord , the husband of her very dear friend , the father of Anne and her sisters , was , as being Sir Walter , in her apprehension , entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties . They must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt .
Anne Elliot	Every emendation of Anne 's had been on the side of honesty against importance .
Anne Elliot	"What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ? There will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct . I have great hope of prevailing . We must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man . "" This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him . She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure , and saw no dignity in anything short of it . She wanted it to be prescribed , and felt as a duty . She rated Lady Russell 's influence highly ; and as to the severe degree of self - denial which her own conscience prompted , she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete , than to half a reformation ."
Anne Elliot	Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both , and so on , through the whole list of Lady Russell 's too gentle reductions .
Anne Elliot	How Anne 's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence .
Anne Elliot	All Anne 's wishes had been for the latter . A small house in their own neighbourhood , where they might still have Lady Russell 's society , still be near Mary , and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch , was the object of her ambition . But the usual fate of Anne attended her , in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on . She disliked Bath , and did not think it agreed with her ; and Bath was to be her home .
Anne Elliot	It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood . Anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw , and to Sir Walter 's feelings they must have been dreadful .
Anne Elliot	And with regard to Anne 's dislike of Bath , she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising , first , from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there , after her mother 's death ; and secondly , from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself . Lady Russell was fond of Bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend 's health , by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good .
Anne Elliot	Anne had been too little from home , too little seen .
Anne Elliot	Her spirits were not high .
Anne Elliot	She had never received from her more than outward attention , nothing beyond the observances of complaisance ; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry , against previous inclination . She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : Elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility .
Anne Elliot	18 It was the beginning of February ; and Anne , having been a month in Bath , was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme .
Anne Elliot	She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated .
Anne Elliot	It was three weeks since she had heard at all . She only knew that Henrietta was at home again ; and that Louisa , though considered to be recovering fast , was still in Lyme ; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening , when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to her ; and , to quicken the pleasure and surprise , with Admiral and Mrs Croft 's compliments .
Anne Elliot	A circumstance to interest her .
Anne Elliot	They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally .
Anne Elliot	"What have they brought you ? "" "" A letter from Uppercross Cottage , Sir ."
Anne Elliot	I should have visited Admiral Croft , however , at any rate .
Anne Elliot	I know what is due to my tenant .
Anne Elliot	Anne could listen no longer ; she could not even have told how the poor Admiral 's complexion escaped ; her letter engrossed her .
Anne Elliot	""" My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence , because I know how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath ."
Anne Elliot	You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross , which , as you well know , affords little to write about .
Anne Elliot	We have had a very dull Christmas ; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays . I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody .
Anne Elliot	: I believe no children ever had such long ones .
Anne Elliot	I am sure I had not .
Anne Elliot	I do not understand it .
Anne Elliot	They are not at all nice children , in my opinion ; but Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well , if not better , than her grandchildren .
Anne Elliot	I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January , except Charles Hayter , who had been calling much oftener than was welcome .
Anne Elliot	Between ourselves , I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa ; it would have kept her a little out of his way .
Anne Elliot	Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey , which is not very likely , considering the care that will be taken of her ; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to - morrow .
Anne Elliot	I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable , and wish I could be acquainted with him too ; but I have my usual luck : I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on ; always the last of my family to be noticed .
Anne Elliot	Does she never mean to go away ? But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant , we might not be invited . Let me know what you think of this .
Anne Elliot	I do not expect my children to be asked , you know . I can leave them at the Great House very well , for a month or six weeks .
Anne Elliot	I have this moment heard that the Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately ; they think the Admiral gouty .
Anne Elliot	Charles heard it quite by chance ; they have not had the civility to give me any notice , or of offering to take anything . I do not think they improve at all as neighbours . We see nothing of them , and this is really an instance of gross inattention .
Anne Elliot	Charles joins me in love , and everything proper .
Anne Elliot	"Yours affectionately , "" Mary M--- . """
Anne Elliot	I am sorry to say that I am very far from well ; and Jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore - throat very much about .
Anne Elliot	I dare say I shall catch it ; and my sore - throats , you know , are always worse than anybody 's .
Anne Elliot	I kept my letter open , that I might send you word how Louisa bore her journey , and now I am extremely glad I did , having a great deal to add .
Anne Elliot	In the first place , I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday , offering to convey anything to you ; a very kind , friendly note indeed , addressed to me , just as it ought ; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like . The Admiral does not seem very ill , and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants .
Anne Elliot	I shall be truly glad to have them back again .
Anne Elliot	I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little .
Anne Elliot	as well as the Harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa , and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by Captain Harville . True , upon my honour !
Anne Elliot	Are not you astonished ?
Anne Elliot	I shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it , for I never did .
Anne Elliot	Indeed , Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her .
Anne Elliot	Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say ; but if you remember , I never thought him attached to Louisa ; I never could see anything of it .
Anne Elliot	And this is the end , you see , of Captain Benwick 's being supposed to be an admirer of yours .
Anne Elliot	How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me . I hope he will be more agreeable now .
Anne Elliot	This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth 's share of interest in the letter ; when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove , and her fine little boys , Anne was at liberty . In her own room , she tried to comprehend it .
Anne Elliot	She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity , or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend .
Anne Elliot	She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly . Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove ! The high - spirited , joyous - talking Louisa Musgrove , and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading , Captain Benwick , seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other .
Anne Elliot	That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary , from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself .
Anne Elliot	She did not mean , however , to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity , than Mary might have allowed . She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment .
Anne Elliot	She saw no reason against their being happy .
Anne Elliot	and sentimental reflection was amusing , but she had no doubt of its being so .
Anne Elliot	The day at Lyme , the fall from the Cobb , might influence her health , her nerves , her courage , her character to the end of her life , as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate .
Anne Elliot	The conclusion of the whole was , that if the woman who had been sensible of Captain Wentworth 's merits could be allowed to prefer another man , there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder ; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it , certainly nothing to be regretted . No , it was not regret which made Anne 's heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free .
Anne Elliot	She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate .
Anne Elliot	She longed to see the Crofts ; but when the meeting took place , it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them .
Anne Elliot	Anne saw them wherever she went .
Anne Elliot	Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the Admiral 's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her . Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft 's arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend 's carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral .
Anne Elliot	He was standing by himself at a printshop window , with his hands behind him , in earnest contemplation of some print , and she not only might have passed him unseen , but was obliged to touch as well as address him
Anne Elliot	before she could catch his notice
Anne Elliot	When he did perceive and acknowledge her , however , it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour .
Anne Elliot	""" Ha ! is it you ?"
Anne Elliot	Thank you , thank you .
Anne Elliot	Here I am , you see , staring at a picture .
Anne Elliot	Did you ever see the like ?
Anne Elliot	What queer fellows your fine painters must be , to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that ?
Anne Elliot	"I am going home . "" "" That I will , with all my heart , and farther , too ."
Anne Elliot	Yes , yes we will have a snug walk together , and I have something to tell you as we go along .
Anne Elliot	There , take my arm ; that 's right ; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there .
Anne Elliot	""" Did you say that you had something to tell me , sir ? "" "" Yes , I have , presently ."
Anne Elliot	But here comes a friend , Captain Brigden ; I shall only say , ` How d'ye do ? ' as we pass , however .
Anne Elliot	I shall not stop .
Anne Elliot	Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife .
Anne Elliot	I am glad they are not on this side of the way .
Anne Elliot	Sophy can not bear them . They played me a pitiful trick once : got away with some of my best men .
Anne Elliot	I will tell you the whole story another time .
Anne Elliot	Look , he sees us ; he kisses his hand to you ; he takes you for my wife .
Anne Elliot	How do you like Bath , Miss Elliot ? It suits us very well .
Anne Elliot	We do not like our lodgings here the worse , I can tell you , for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth .
Anne Elliot	"The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way . "" When they were got a little farther , Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate . She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified ; but she was still obliged to wait , for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont ; and as she was not really Mrs Croft , she must let him have his own way ."
Anne Elliot	"As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont , he began-- "" Well , now you shall hear something that will surprise you ."
Anne Elliot	But first of all , you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about .
Anne Elliot	That young lady , you know , that we have all been so concerned for .
Anne Elliot	"Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did ; but now she could safely suggest the name of "" Louisa ."
Anne Elliot	I should never be out if they were all Sophys , or something of that sort . Well , this Miss Louisa , we all thought , you know , was to marry Frederick . He was courting her week after week .
Anne Elliot	"You know James Benwick . "" "" A little ."
Anne Elliot	I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick .
Anne Elliot	Nay , most likely they are married already , for I do not know what they should wait for .
Anne Elliot	""" I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man , "" said Anne , "" and I understand that he bears an excellent character ."
Anne Elliot	He is only a commander , it is true , made last summer , and these are bad times for getting on , but he has not another fault that I know of .
Anne Elliot	"An excellent , good - hearted fellow , I assure you ; a very active , zealous officer too , which is more than you would think for , perhaps , for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice . """
Anne Elliot	""" Indeed you are mistaken there , sir ; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick 's manners ."
Anne Elliot	I thought them particularly pleasing , and I will answer for it , they would generally please .
Anne Elliot	"There is something about Frederick more to our taste . "" Anne was caught ."
Anne Elliot	"She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other , not at all to represent Captain Benwick 's manners as the very best that could possibly be ; and , after a little hesitation , she was beginning to say , "" I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends , "" but the Admiral interrupted her with-- "" And the thing is certainly true . It is not a mere bit of gossip ."
Anne Elliot	"I fancy they are all at Uppercross . "" This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist ; she said , therefore , "" I hope , Admiral , I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth 's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy ."
Anne Elliot	"I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill - used man . "" "" Not at all , not at all ; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end . "" Anne looked down to hide her smile . "" No , no ; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that ."
Anne Elliot	But what I mean is , that I hope there is nothing in Captain Wentworth 's manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill - used by his friend , which might appear , you know , without its being absolutely said .
Anne Elliot	I should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be destroyed , or even wounded , by a circumstance of this sort .
Anne Elliot	""" Yes , yes , I understand you ."
Anne Elliot	No , you would not guess , from his way of writing , that he had ever thought of this Miss ( what 's her name ? ) for himself . He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together ; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that , I think .
Anne Elliot	""" Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to convey , but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther ."
Anne Elliot	"Do not you think , Miss Elliot , we had better try to get him to Bath ? """
Anne Elliot	19 While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne , and expressing his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath , Captain Wentworth was already on his way thither .
Anne Elliot	Before Mrs Croft had written , he was arrived , and the very next time Anne walked out , she saw him .
Anne Elliot	It began to rain , not much , but enough to make shelter desirable for women , and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple 's carriage , which was seen waiting at a little distance ; she , Anne , and Mrs Clay , therefore , turned into Molland 's , while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple , to request her assistance .
Anne Elliot	The rain was a mere trifle , and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot .
Anne Elliot	much thicker than Miss Anne 's ; and , in short , her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be , and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined , that the others were obliged to settle it for them ; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already , and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal ,
Anne Elliot	that his cousin Anne 's boots were rather the thickest .
Anne Elliot	It was fixed accordingly , that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the carriage ; and they had just reached this point , when Anne , as she sat near the window , descried , most decidedly and distinctly , Captain Wentworth walking down the street .
Anne Elliot	Her start was perceptible only to herself ; but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world , the most unaccountable and absurd !
Anne Elliot	For a few minutes she saw nothing before her ; it was all confusion . She was lost , and when she had scolded back her senses , she found the others still waiting for the carriage , and Mr Elliot ( always obliging ) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs Clay 's . She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door ; she wanted to see if it rained .
Anne Elliot	Why was she to suspect herself of another motive ?
Anne Elliot	She left her seat , she would go ; one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half , or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was .
Anne Elliot	She would see if it rained .
Anne Elliot	She was sent back , however , in a moment by the entrance of Captain Wentworth himself , among a party of gentlemen and ladies , evidently his acquaintance , and whom he must have joined a little below Milsom Street .
Anne Elliot	He was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before ; he looked quite red .
Anne Elliot	For the first time , since their renewed acquaintance , she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two .
Anne Elliot	She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments .
Anne Elliot	All the overpowering , blinding , bewildering , first effects of strong surprise were over with her .
Anne Elliot	Still , however , she had enough to feel !
Anne Elliot	He spoke to her , and then turned away .
Anne Elliot	She could not have called it either cold or friendly , or anything so certainly as embarrassed . After a short interval , however , he came towards her , and spoke again .
Anne Elliot	Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed : neither of them , probably , much the wiser for what they heard , and Anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly .
Anne Elliot	He looked very well , not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits , and he talked of Uppercross , of the Musgroves , nay , even of Louisa , and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her ; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable , not easy , not able to feign that he was . It did not surprise , but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him .
Anne Elliot	She saw that he saw Elizabeth , that Elizabeth saw him , that there was complete internal recognition on each side ; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance , expecting it , and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness .
Anne Elliot	Lady Dalrymple 's carriage , for which Miss Elliot was growing very impatient , now drew up ; the servant came in to announce it . It was beginning to rain again , and altogether there was a delay , and a bustle , and a talking , which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot .
Anne Elliot	At last Miss Elliot and her friend , unattended but by the servant , ( for there was no cousin returned ) , were walking off ; and Captain Wentworth , watching them , turned again to Anne , and by manner , rather than words , was offering his services to her .
Anne Elliot	""" I am much obliged to you , "" was her answer , "" but I am not going with them . The carriage would not accommodate so many ."
Anne Elliot	I walk : I prefer walking .
Anne Elliot	"After a moment 's pause he said : "" Though I came only yesterday , I have equipped myself properly for Bath already , you see , "" ( pointing to a new umbrella ) ; "" I wish you would make use of it , if you are determined to walk ; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair . "" She was very much obliged to him , but declined it all , repeating her conviction , that the rain would come to nothing at present , and adding , "" I am only waiting for Mr Elliot ."
Anne Elliot	"He will be here in a moment , I am sure . """
Anne Elliot	She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in .
Anne Elliot	"There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme , admiring Anne as she passed , except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend . He came in with eagerness , appeared to see and think only of her , apologised for his stay , was grieved to have kept her waiting , and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased ; and in another moment they walked off together , her arm under his , a gentle and embarrassed glance , and a "" Good morning to you ! "" being all that she had time for , as she passed away ."
Anne Elliot	""" Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin , I fancy ?"
Anne Elliot	"One can guess what will happen there . He is always with them ; half lives in the family , I believe . What a very good - looking man ! "" "" Yes , and Miss Atkinson , who dined with him once at the Wallises , says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with ."
Anne Elliot	""" She is pretty , I think ; Anne Elliot ; very pretty , when one comes to look at her ."
Anne Elliot	It is not the fashion to say so , but I confess I admire her more than her sister .
Anne Elliot	"so do I. """
Anne Elliot	Anne is too delicate for them .
Anne Elliot	""" Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin , if he would have walked by her side all the way to Camden Place , without saying a word ."
Anne Elliot	She had never found it so difficult to listen to him , though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care , and though his subjects were principally such as were wo nt to be always interesting : praise , warm , just , and discriminating , of Lady Russell , and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay .
Anne Elliot	But just now she could think only of Captain Wentworth .
Anne Elliot	She could not understand his present feelings , whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not ; and till that point were settled , she could not be quite herself .
Anne Elliot	She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time ; but alas !
Anne Elliot	alas ! she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet . Another circumstance very essential for her to know , was how long he meant to be in Bath ; he had not mentioned it , or she could not recollect it . He might be only passing through . But it was more probable that he should be come to stay .
Anne Elliot	How would it all be ? She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick .
Anne Elliot	It had cost her something to encounter Lady Russell 's surprise ; and now , if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth , her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him .
Anne Elliot	The following morning Anne was out with her friend , and for the first hour , in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain ; but at last , in returning down Pulteney Street , she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street .
Anne Elliot	She looked instinctively at Lady Russell ; but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself .
Anne Elliot	No , it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite . She looked at her however , from time to time , anxiously ; and when the moment approached which must point him out , though not daring to look again ( for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen ) , she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell 's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him-- of her being , in short , intently observing him .
Anne Elliot	She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell 's mind , the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes , the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him , and in foreign climes and in active service too , without robbing him of one personal grace ! At last , Lady Russell drew back her head .
Anne Elliot	""" Now , how would she speak of him ? """
Anne Elliot	Anne sighed and blushed and smiled , in pity and disdain , either at her friend or herself . The part which provoked her most , was that in all this waste of foresight and caution , she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them .
Anne Elliot	The theatre or the rooms , where he was most likely to be , were not fashionable enough for the Elliots , whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties , in which they were getting more and more engaged ; and Anne , wearied of such a state of stagnation , sick of knowing nothing , and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried , was quite impatient for the concert evening .
Anne Elliot	It was really expected to be a good one , and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music . If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again , she fancied she should be satisfied ; and as to the power of addressing him , she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred .
Anne Elliot	Who is your party ?
Anne Elliot	"Anne named them all . Mrs Smith made no reply ; but when she was leaving her said , and with an expression half serious , half arch , "" Well , I heartily wish your concert may answer ; and do not fail me to - morrow if you can come ; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you . "" Anne was startled and confused ; but after standing in a moment 's suspense , was obliged , and not sorry to be obliged , to hurry away ."
Anne Elliot	"I venture to hint , that Sir Walter Elliot can not be half so jealous for his own , as John Shepherd will be for him . "" Here Anne spoke-- "" The navy , I think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give ."
Anne Elliot	"What Miss Anne says , is very true , "" was Mr Shepherd 's rejoinder , and "" Oh ! certainly , "" was his daughter 's"
Anne Elliot	"The lawyer plods , quite care - worn ; the physician is up at all hours , and travelling in all weather ; and even the clergyman-- "" she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman;--""and even the clergyman , you know is obliged to go into infected rooms , and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere ."
Anne Elliot	"Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman 's family , and mentioned a place ; and Anne , after the little pause which followed , added-- "" He is a rear admiral of the white ."
Anne Elliot	"He was in the Trafalgar action , and has been in the East Indies since ; he was stationed there , I believe , several years . "" "" Then I take it for granted , "" observed Sir Walter , "" that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery . """
Anne Elliot	Penelope , my dear , can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford : Mrs Croft 's brother ?
Anne Elliot	"A name that I am so very well acquainted with ; knew the gentleman so well by sight ; seen him a hundred times ; came to consult me once , I remember , about a trespass of one of his neighbours ; farmer 's man breaking into his orchard ; wall torn down ; apples stolen ; caught in the fact ; and afterwards , contrary to my judgement , submitted to an amicable compromise . Very odd indeed ! "" After waiting another moment-- "" You mean Mr Wentworth , I suppose ? "" said Anne ."
Anne Elliot	"such an end been reached , than Anne , who had been a most attentive listener to the whole , left the room , to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks ; and as she walked along a favourite grove , said , with a gentle sigh , "" A few months more , and he , perhaps , may be walking here ."
Anne Elliot	23 One day only had passed since Anne 's conversation with Mrs Smith ; but a keener interest had succeeded , and she was now so little touched by Mr Elliot 's conduct , except by its effects in one quarter , that it became a matter of course the next morning , still to defer her explanatory visit in Rivers Street . She had promised to be with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner .
Anne Elliot	Her faith was plighted , and Mr Elliot 's character , like the Sultaness Scheherazade 's head , must live another day .
Anne Elliot	She could not keep her appointment punctually , however ; the weather was unfavourable , and she had grieved over the rain on her friends ' account , and felt it very much on her own , before she was able to attempt the walk . When she reached the White Hart , and made her way to the proper apartment , she found herself neither arriving quite in time , nor the first to arrive .
Anne Elliot	The party before her were , Mrs Musgrove , talking to Mrs Croft , and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth ; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta , too impatient to wait , had gone out the moment it had cleared , but would be back again soon , and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned . She had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed . There was no delay , no waste of time .
Anne Elliot	"She was deep in the happiness of such misery , or the misery of such happiness , instantly . Two minutes after her entering the room , Captain Wentworth said-- "" We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials . "" Materials were at hand , on a separate table ; he went to it , and nearly turning his back to them all , was engrossed by writing . Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter 's engagement , and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper ."
Anne Elliot	"Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation , and yet , as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk , she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars ; such as , "" how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again"
Anne Elliot	"to talk it over ; what my brother Hayter had said one day , and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next , and what had occurred to my sister Hayter , and what the young people had wished , and what I said at first I never could consent to , but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well , "" and a great deal in the same style of open - hearted communication : minutiae which , even with every advantage of taste and delicacy , which good Mrs Musgrove could not give , could be properly interesting only to the principals ."
Anne Elliot	Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self - occupied to hear .
Anne Elliot	Anne found an unexpected interest here .
Anne Elliot	She felt its application to herself , felt it in a nervous thrill all over her ; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table , Captain Wentworth 's pen ceased to move , his head was raised , pausing , listening , and he turned round the next instant to give a look , one quick , conscious look at her . The two ladies continued to talk , to re - urge the same admitted truths , and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation , but Anne heard nothing distinctly ; it was only a buzz of words in her ear , her mind was in confusion . Captain Harville , who had in truth been hearing none of it , now left his seat , and moved to a window , and Anne seeming to watch him , though it was from thorough absence of mind , became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood .
Anne Elliot	"He looked at her with a smile , and a little motion of the head , which expressed , "" Come to me , I have something to say ; "" and the unaffected , easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was , strongly enforced the invitation ."
Anne Elliot	She roused herself and went to him .
Anne Elliot	"The window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting , and though nearer to Captain Wentworth 's table , not very near . As she joined him , Captain Harville 's countenance re - assumed the serious , thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character . "" Look here , "" said he , unfolding a parcel in his hand , and displaying a small miniature painting , "" do you know who that is ?"
Anne Elliot	""" Yes , and you may guess who it is for . But , "" ( in a deep tone , ) "" it was not done for her ."
Anne Elliot	Miss Elliot , do you remember our walking together at Lyme , and grieving for him ?
Anne Elliot	I little thought then-- but no matter .
Anne Elliot	He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape , and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister , sat to him , and was bringing it home for her ; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another !
Anne Elliot	It was a commission to me !
Anne Elliot	I hope I can allow for him . I am not sorry , indeed , to make it over to another .
Anne Elliot	""" No , "" replied Anne , in a low , feeling voice ."
Anne Elliot	""" That I can easily believe . """
Anne Elliot	""" It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved . "" Captain Harville smiled , as much as to say , "" Do you claim that for your sex ? "" and she answered the question , smiling also , "" Yes ."
Anne Elliot	We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us .
Anne Elliot	You are forced on exertion .
Anne Elliot	You have always a profession , pursuits , business of some sort or other , to take you back into the world immediately , and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions .
Anne Elliot	""" "" Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men ( which , however , I do not think I shall grant ) , it does not apply to Benwick ."
Anne Elliot	The peace turned him on shore at the very moment , and he has been living with us , in our little family circle , ever since .
Anne Elliot	""" "" True , "" said Anne , "" very true ; I did not recollect ; but what shall we say now , Captain Harville ?"
Anne Elliot	"I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental ; and that as our bodies are the strongest , so are our feelings ; capable of bearing most rough usage , and riding out the heaviest weather . "" "" Your feelings may be the strongest , "" replied Anne , "" but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender ."
Anne Elliot	Man is more robust than woman , but he is not longer lived ; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments .
Anne Elliot	Nay , it would be too hard upon you , if it were otherwise .
Anne Elliot	You have difficulties , and privations , and dangers enough to struggle with .
Anne Elliot	You are always labouring and toiling , exposed to every risk and hardship .
Anne Elliot	Your home , country , friends , all quitted . Neither time , nor health , nor life , to be called your own .
Anne Elliot	It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down ; but Anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed , and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them , striving to catch sounds , which yet she did not think he could have caught .
Anne Elliot	""" Have you finished your letter ? "" said Captain Harville ."
Anne Elliot	""" "" There is no hurry on my side . I am only ready whenever you are ."
Anne Elliot	"I am in very good anchorage here , "" ( smiling at Anne , ) "" well supplied , and want for nothing . No hurry for a signal at all ."
Anne Elliot	"Well , Miss Elliot , "" ( lowering his voice , ) "" as I was saying we shall never agree , I suppose , upon this point ."
Anne Elliot	But let me observe that all histories are against you -- all stories , prose and verse .
Anne Elliot	If I had such a memory as Benwick , I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument , and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman 's inconstancy .
Anne Elliot	"But perhaps you will say , these were all written by men . "" "" Perhaps I shall ."
Anne Elliot	If I could explain to you all this , and all that a man can bear and do , and glories to do , for the sake of these treasures of his existence
Anne Elliot	"I speak , you know , only of such men as have hearts ! """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! "" cried Anne eagerly , "" I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you ."
Anne Elliot	God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow - creatures !
Anne Elliot	I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman .
Anne Elliot	No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as -- if I may be allowed the expression -- so long as you have an object .
Anne Elliot	I mean while the woman you love lives , and lives for you .
Anne Elliot	All the privilege I claim for my own sex ( it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it ) , is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone .
Anne Elliot	""" She could not immediately have uttered another sentence ; her heart was too full , her breath too much oppressed ."
Anne Elliot	""" You are a good soul , "" cried Captain Harville , putting his hand on her arm , quite affectionately ."
Anne Elliot	""" There is no quarrelling with you ."
Anne Elliot	"To - night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party , "" ( turning to Anne . ) "" We had your sister 's card yesterday , and I understood Frederick had a card too , though I did not see it ; and you are disengaged , Frederick , are you not , as well as ourselves ? "" Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste , and either could not or would not answer fully ."
Anne Elliot	Anne knew not how to understand it .
Anne Elliot	"She had the kindest "" Good morning , God bless you ! "" from Captain Harville , but from him not a word , nor a look !"
Anne Elliot	He had passed out of the room without a look ! She had only time , however , to move closer to the table where he had been writing , when footsteps were heard returning ; the door opened , it was himself .
Anne Elliot	He begged their pardon , but he had forgotten his gloves , and instantly crossing the room to the writing table , he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper , placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time , and hastily collecting his gloves , was again out of the room , almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it : the work of an instant !
Anne Elliot	"The revolution which one instant had made in Anne , was almost beyond expression . The letter , with a direction hardly legible , to "" Miss A. E.-- , "" was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily ."
Anne Elliot	While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick , he had been also addressing her !
Anne Elliot	On the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her .
Anne Elliot	"Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table ; to their protection she must trust , and sinking into the chair which he had occupied , succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written , her eyes devoured the following words : "" I can listen no longer in silence ."
Anne Elliot	I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach .
Anne Elliot	You pierce my soul .
Anne Elliot	Tell me not that I am too late , that such precious feelings are gone for ever . I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it , eight years and a half ago .
Anne Elliot	I have loved none but you .
Anne Elliot	You alone have brought me to Bath .
Anne Elliot	For you alone , I think and plan .
Anne Elliot	Have you not seen this ?
Anne Elliot	Can you fail to have understood my wishes ?
Anne Elliot	I had not waited even these ten days , could I have read your feelings , as I think you must have penetrated mine . I can hardly write .
Anne Elliot	You sink your voice , but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others .
Anne Elliot	You do us justice , indeed .
Anne Elliot	You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men .
Anne Elliot	I must go , uncertain of my fate ; but I shall return hither , or follow your party , as soon as possible .
Anne Elliot	Half and hour 's solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her ; but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted , with all the restraints of her situation , could do nothing towards tranquillity .
Anne Elliot	And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation , Charles , Mary , and Henrietta all came in .
Anne Elliot	The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle ; but after a while she could do no more .
Anne Elliot	She began not to understand a word they said , and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself .
Anne Elliot	They could then see that she looked very ill , were shocked and concerned , and would not stir without her for the world . This was dreadful .
Anne Elliot	Would they only have gone away , and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure ; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting , and in desperation , she said she would go home .
Anne Elliot	""" By all means , my dear , "" cried Mrs Musgrove , "" go home directly , and take care of yourself , that you may be fit for the evening ."
Anne Elliot	I wish Sarah was here to doctor you , but I am no doctor myself .
Anne Elliot	Charles , ring and order a chair . She must not walk .
Anne Elliot	To lose the possibility of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet , solitary progress up the town ( and she felt almost certain of meeting him ) could not be borne .
Anne Elliot	"The chair was earnestly protested against , and Mrs Musgrove , who thought only of one sort of illness , having assured herself with some anxiety , that there had been no fall in the case ; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down , and got a blow on her head ; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall ; could part with her cheerfully , and depend on finding her better at night . Anxious to omit no possible precaution , Anne struggled , and said-- "" I am afraid , ma'am , that it is not perfectly understood . Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening ."
Anne Elliot	I am afraid there had been some mistake ; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth , that we hope to see them both .
Anne Elliot	""" "" Do you think so ? But I am afraid ; and I should be so very sorry ."
Anne Elliot	Will you promise me to mention it , when you see them again ?
Anne Elliot	"Do promise me . "" "" To be sure I will , if you wish it ."
Anne Elliot	Charles , if you see Captain Harville anywhere , remember to give Miss Anne 's message .
Anne Elliot	But indeed , my dear , you need not be uneasy .
Anne Elliot	Anne could do no more ; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity .
Anne Elliot	Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself , it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville .
Anne Elliot	Charles , in his real concern and good nature , would go home with her ; there was no preventing him .
Anne Elliot	But she could not be long ungrateful ; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith 's , to be of use to her ; and she set off with him , with no feeling but gratitude apparent .
Anne Elliot	They were on Union Street , when a quicker step behind , a something of familiar sound , gave her two moments ' preparation for the sight of Captain Wentworth .
Anne Elliot	Anne could command herself enough to receive that look , and not repulsively .
Anne Elliot	He walked by her side .
Anne Elliot	""" Are you going as high as Belmont ?"
Anne Elliot	Are you going near Camden Place ?
Anne Elliot	Because , if you are , I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place , and give Anne your arm to her father 's door .
Anne Elliot	She is rather done for this morning , and must not go so far without help , and I ought to be at that fellow 's in the Market Place .
Anne Elliot	He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off ; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment , that I might see it ; and if I do not turn back now , I have no chance .
Anne Elliot	"By his description , a good deal like the second size double - barrel of mine , which you shot with one day round Winthrop . """
Anne Elliot	She had not mistaken him .
Anne Elliot	Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment . That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four - and - twenty hours . It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks , or words , or actions occasionally encouraged ; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville ; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper , and poured out his feelings .
Anne Elliot	He persisted in having loved none but her .
Anne Elliot	She had never been supplanted .
Anne Elliot	He never even believed himself to see her equal .
Anne Elliot	Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge : that he had been constant unconsciously , nay unintentionally ; that he had meant to forget her , and believed it to be done .
Anne Elliot	He had imagined himself indifferent , when he had only been angry ; and he had been unjust to her merits , because he had been a sufferer from them . Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself , maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness ; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice , and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself .
Anne Elliot	The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused him , and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville 's had fixed her superiority .
Anne Elliot	In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove ( the attempts of angry pride ) , he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible ; that he had not cared , could not care , for Louisa ; though till that day , till the leisure for reflection which followed it , he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa 's could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . There , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self - will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind .
Anne Elliot	There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost ; and there begun to deplore the pride , the folly , the madness of resentment , which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way .
Anne Elliot	He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa 's accident , no sooner begun to feel himself alive again , than he had begun to feel himself , though alive , not at liberty .
Anne Elliot	"I had not thought seriously on this subject before . I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways ; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls , at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report , were there no other ill effects . I had been grossly wrong , and must abide the consequences . "" He found too late , in short , that he had entangled himself ; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at all , he must regard himself as bound to her , if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed ."
Anne Elliot	It determined him to leave Lyme , and await her complete recovery elsewhere .
Anne Elliot	"He enquired after you very particularly ; asked even if you were personally altered , little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter . """
Anne Elliot	Anne smiled , and let it pass .
Anne Elliot	"It is something for a woman to be assured , in her eight - and - twentieth year , that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth ; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Anne , by comparing it with former words , and feeling it to be the result , not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment . He had remained in Shropshire , lamenting the blindness of his own pride , and the blunders of his own calculations , till at once released from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with Benwick . "" Here , "" said he , "" ended the worst of my state ; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness ; I could exert myself ; I could do something ."
Anne Elliot	You were single .
Anne Elliot	It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past , as I did ; and one encouragement happened to be mine .
Anne Elliot	"I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others , but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man , at least , of better pretensions than myself ; and I could not help often saying , ` Was this for me ? ' """
Anne Elliot	"The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him : the moment of Mr Elliot 's appearing and tearing her away , and one or two subsequent moments , marked by returning hope or increasing despondency , were dwelt on with energy . """
Anne Elliot	"To see you , "" cried he , "" in the midst of those who could not be my well - wishers ; to see your cousin close by you , conversing and smiling , and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match ! To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you !"
Anne Elliot	Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent , to consider what powerful supports would be his !
Anne Elliot	"Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you , was not the recollection of what had been , the knowledge of her influence , the indelible , immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done-- was it not all against me ? "" "" You should have distinguished , "" replied Anne ."
Anne Elliot	""" You should not have suspected me now ; the case is so different , and my age is so different ."
Anne Elliot	If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once , remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety , not of risk . When I yielded , I thought it was to duty , but no duty could be called in aid here .
Anne Elliot	In marrying a man indifferent to me , all risk would have been incurred , and all duty violated .
Anne Elliot	I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of your character .
Anne Elliot	I could think of you only as one who had yielded , who had given me up , who had been influenced by any one rather than by me .
Anne Elliot	I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery .
Anne Elliot	""" I should have thought , "" said Anne , "" that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this ."
Anne Elliot	your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give .
Anne Elliot	I left you in this belief ; and yet , I was determined to see you again .
Anne Elliot	""" At last Anne was at home again , and happier than any one in that house could have conceived ."
Anne Elliot	All the surprise and suspense , and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation , she re - entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last .
Anne Elliot	An interval of meditation , serious and grateful , was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high - wrought felicity ; and she went to her room , and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment .
Anne Elliot	It was but a card party , it was but a mixture of those who had never met before , and those who met too often ; a commonplace business , too numerous for intimacy , too small for variety ; but Anne had never found an evening shorter .
Anne Elliot	Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness , and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for , she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her .
Anne Elliot	Mr Elliot was there ; she avoided , but she could pity him .
Anne Elliot	The Wallises , she had amusement in understanding them .
Anne Elliot	Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret -- they would soon be innoxious cousins to her .
Anne Elliot	She cared not for Mrs Clay , and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister . With the Musgroves , there was the happy chat of perfect ease ; with Captain Harville , the kind - hearted intercourse of brother and sister ; with Lady Russell , attempts at conversation , which a delicious consciousness cut short ; with Admiral and Mrs Croft , everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest , which the same consciousness sought to conceal ; and with Captain Wentworth , some moments of communications continually occurring , and always the hope of more , and always the knowledge of his being there .
Anne Elliot	"It was in one of these short meetings , each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants , that she said-- "" I have been thinking over the past , and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong , I mean with regard to myself ; and I must believe that I was right , much as I suffered from it , that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now ."
Anne Elliot	To me , she was in the place of a parent .
Anne Elliot	Do not mistake me , however .
Anne Elliot	I am not saying that she did not err in her advice . It was , perhaps , one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides ; and for myself , I certainly never should , in any circumstance of tolerable similarity , give such advice .
Anne Elliot	"But I mean , that I was right in submitting to her , and that if I had done otherwise , I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up , because I should have suffered in my conscience . I have now , as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature , nothing to reproach myself with ; and if I mistake not , a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman 's portion . "" He looked at her , looked at Lady Russell , and looking again at her , replied , as if in cool deliberation-- "" Not yet . But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time ."
Anne Elliot	Tell me if , when I returned to England in the year eight , with a few thousand pounds , and was posted into the Laconia , if I had then written to you , would you have answered my letter ? Would you , in short , have renewed the engagement then ?
Anne Elliot	""" Would I ! "" was all her answer ; but the accent was decisive enough ."
Anne Elliot	""" Good God ! "" he cried , "" you would !"
Anne Elliot	I did not understand you .
Anne Elliot	I shut my eyes , and would not understand you , or do you justice .
Anne Elliot	"Anne entered it with a sinking heart , anticipating an imprisonment of many months , and anxiously saying to herself , "" Oh ! when shall I leave you again ? """
Anne Elliot	A degree of unexpected cordiality , however , in the welcome she received , did her good .
Anne Elliot	Her father and sister were glad to see her , for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture , and met her with kindness .
Anne Elliot	Her making a fourth , when they sat down to dinner , was noticed as an advantage .
Anne Elliot	Anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival , but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for .
Anne Elliot	They had no inclination to listen to her .
Anne Elliot	After laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood , which Anne could not pay , they had only a few faint enquiries to make , before the talk must be all their own .
Anne Elliot	They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered their expectations in every respect .
Anne Elliot	Could Anne wonder that her father and sister were happy ?
Anne Elliot	She might not wonder , but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change , should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder , should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town ; and she must sigh , and smile , and wonder too , as Elizabeth threw open the folding - doors and walked with exultation from one drawing - room to the other , boasting of their space ; at the possibility of that woman , who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall , finding extent to be proud of between two walls , perhaps thirty feet asunder .
Anne Elliot	Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot .
Anne Elliot	Anne listened , but without quite understanding it .
Anne Elliot	Allowances , large allowances , she knew , must be made for the ideas of those who spoke .
Anne Elliot	She heard it all under embellishment .
Anne Elliot	All that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators . Still , however , she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared , in Mr Elliot 's wishing , after an interval of so many years , to be well received by them .
Anne Elliot	A sensible man , and he had looked like a very sensible man , why should it be an object to him ? She could only offer one solution ; it was , perhaps , for Elizabeth 's sake .
Anne Elliot	How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one . Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if Elizabeth were his object ; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while Mr Elliot 's frequent visits were talked of . Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme , but without being much attended to .
Anne Elliot	They could not listen to her description of him .
Anne Elliot	""" If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , I would send her a new hat and pelisse . "" Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown , or a cap , would not be liable to any such misuse , when a knock at the door suspended everything ."
Anne Elliot	"Anne drew a little back , while the others received his compliments , and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour , but "" he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before , "" & c. & c ; which was all as politely done , and as politely taken , as possible , but her part must follow then . Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter ; "" Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter "" ( there was no occasion for remembering Mary ) ; and Anne , smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was ."
Anne Elliot	and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship , alluded to the past , and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already . He was quite as good - looking as he had appeared at Lyme , his countenance improved by speaking , and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be , so polished , so easy , so particularly agreeable , that she could compare them in excellence to only one person 's manners .
Anne Elliot	As soon as he could , he began to talk to her of Lyme , wanting to compare opinions respecting the place , but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time ; to give his own route , understand something of hers , and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her .
Anne Elliot	She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme .
Anne Elliot	"The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view . "" But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone : he knew it ; he was soon diffused again among the others , and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme ."
Anne Elliot	His enquiries , however , produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there , soon after his leaving the place .
Anne Elliot	She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell , in the wish of really comprehending what had passed , and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it .
Anne Elliot	Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in Camden Place could have passed so well !
Anne Elliot	24 Who can be in doubt of what followed ? When any two young people take it into their heads to marry , they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point , be they ever so poor , or ever so imprudent , or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other 's ultimate comfort . This may be bad morality to conclude with , but I believe it to be truth ; and if such parties succeed , how should a Captain Wentworth and an Anne Elliot , with the advantage of maturity of mind , consciousness of right , and one independent fortune between them , fail of bearing down every opposition ? They might in fact , have borne down a great deal more than they met with , for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth .
Anne Elliot	Sir Walter , indeed , though he had no affection for Anne , and no vanity flattered , to make him really happy on the occasion , was very far from thinking it a bad match for her . On the contrary , when he saw more of Captain Wentworth , saw him repeatedly by daylight , and eyed him well , he was very much struck by his personal claims , and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank ; and all this , assisted by his well - sounding name , enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen , with a very good grace , for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour .
Anne Elliot	Anne knew that Lady Russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot , and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with , and do justice to Captain Wentworth .
Anne Elliot	This however was what Lady Russell had now to do . She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both ; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each ; that because Captain Wentworth 's manners had not suited her own ideas , she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity ; and that because Mr Elliot 's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness , their general politeness and suavity , she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well - regulated mind .
Anne Elliot	But she was a very good woman , and if her second object was to be sensible and well - judging , her first was to see Anne happy . She loved Anne better than she loved her own abilities ; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over , found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child .
Anne Elliot	It was creditable to have a sister married , and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion , by keeping Anne with her in the autumn ; and as her own sister must be better than her husband 's sisters , it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter .
Anne Elliot	She had something to suffer , perhaps , when they came into contact again , in seeing Anne restored to the rights of seniority , and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette ; but she had a future to look forward to , of powerful consolation .
Anne Elliot	Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her , no landed estate , no headship of a family ; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet , she would not change situations with Anne .
Anne Elliot	She had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw , and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him .
Anne Elliot	The news of his cousins Anne 's engagement burst on Mr Elliot most unexpectedly .
Anne Elliot	It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness , his best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness which a son - in - law 's rights would have given .
Anne Elliot	But , though discomfited and disappointed , he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment .
Anne Elliot	He soon quitted Bath ; and on Mrs Clay 's quitting it soon afterwards , and being next heard of as established under his protection in London , it was evident how double a game he had been playing , and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman , at least .
Anne Elliot	Mrs Clay 's affections had overpowered her interest , and she had sacrificed , for the young man 's sake , the possibility of scheming longer for Sir Walter .
Anne Elliot	She has abilities , however , as well as affections ; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning , or hers , may finally carry the day ; whether , after preventing her from being the wife of Sir Walter , he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William . It can not be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion , and the discovery of their deception in her . They had their great cousins , to be sure , to resort to for comfort ; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others , without being flattered and followed in turn , is but a state of half enjoyment .
Anne Elliot	Anne , satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell 's meaning to love Captain Wentworth as she ought , had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value .
Anne Elliot	There she felt her own inferiority very keenly .
Anne Elliot	The disproportion in their fortune was nothing ; it did not give her a moment 's regret ; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly , nothing of respectability , of harmony , of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters , was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity .
Anne Elliot	She had but two friends in the world to add to his list , Lady Russell and Mrs Smith .
Anne Elliot	Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for Mrs Smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently .
Anne Elliot	Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves , and their marriage , instead of depriving her of one friend , secured her two .
Anne Elliot	She was their earliest visitor in their settled life ; and Captain Wentworth , by putting her in the way of recovering her husband 's property in the West Indies , by writing for her , acting for her , and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend , fully requited the services which she had rendered , or ever meant to render , to his wife .
Anne Elliot	She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy , and yet be happy . Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits , as her friend Anne 's was in the warmth of her heart . Anne was tenderness itself , and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth 's affection .
Anne Elliot	His profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less , the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine .
Anne Elliot	She gloried in being a sailor 's wife , but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is , if possible , more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance . Finis
Anne Elliot	4 He was not Mr Wentworth , the former curate of Monkford , however suspicious appearances may be , but a Captain Frederick Wentworth , his brother , who being made commander in consequence of the action off St Domingo , and not immediately employed , had come into Somersetshire , in the summer of 1806 ; and having no parent living , found a home for half a year at Monkford . He was , at that time , a remarkably fine young man , with a great deal of intelligence , spirit , and brilliancy ; and Anne an extremely pretty girl , with gentleness , modesty , taste , and feeling .
Anne Elliot	Half the sum of attraction , on either side , might have been enough , for he had nothing to do , and she had hardly anybody to love ; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail .
Anne Elliot	It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other , or which had been the happiest : she , in receiving his declarations and proposals , or he in having them accepted .
Anne Elliot	Sir Walter , on being applied to , without actually withholding his consent , or saying it should never be , gave it all the negative of great astonishment , great coldness , great silence , and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter .
Anne Elliot	He thought it a very degrading alliance ; and Lady Russell , though with more tempered and pardonable pride , received it as a most unfortunate one . Anne Elliot , with all her claims of birth , beauty , and mind , to throw herself away at nineteen ; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man , who had nothing but himself to recommend him , and no hopes of attaining affluence , but in the chances of a most uncertain profession , and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession , would be , indeed , a throwing away , which she grieved to think of !
Anne Elliot	Anne Elliot , so young ; known to so few , to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune ; or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing , anxious , youth - killing dependence !
Anne Elliot	Such confidence , powerful in its own warmth , and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it , must have been enough for Anne ; but Lady Russell saw it very differently .
Anne Elliot	His sanguine temper , and fearlessness of mind , operated very differently on her .
Anne Elliot	She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil .
Anne Elliot	Lady Russell had little taste for wit , and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror .
Anne Elliot	She deprecated the connexion in every light .
Anne Elliot	Such opposition , as these feelings produced , was more than Anne could combat . Young and gentle as she was , it might yet have been possible to withstand her father 's ill - will , though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister ; but Lady Russell , whom she had always loved and relied on , could not , with such steadiness of opinion , and such tenderness of manner , be continually advising her in vain .
Anne Elliot	She was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing : indiscreet , improper , hardly capable of success , and not deserving it . But it was not a merely selfish caution , under which she acted , in putting an end to it .
Anne Elliot	Had she not imagined herself consulting his good , even more than her own , she could hardly have given him up . The belief of being prudent , and self - denying , principally for his advantage ,
Anne Elliot	was her chief consolation , under the misery of a parting , a final parting ; and every consolation
Anne Elliot	was required , for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions , on his side , totally unconvinced and unbending , and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment . He had left the country in consequence .
Anne Elliot	A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance ; but not with a few months ended Anne 's share of suffering from it . Her attachment and regrets had , for a long time , clouded every enjoyment of youth , and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect .
Anne Elliot	More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close ; and time had softened down much , perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him , but she had been too dependent on time alone ; no aid had been given in change of place ( except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture ) , or in any novelty or enlargement of society .
Anne Elliot	No one had ever come within the Kellynch circle , who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth , as he stood in her memory .
Anne Elliot	No second attachment , the only thoroughly natural , happy , and sufficient cure , at her time of life , had been possible to the nice tone of her mind , the fastidiousness of her taste , in the small limits of the society around them . She had been solicited , when about two - and - twenty , to change her name , by the young man , who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister ; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal ; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man , whose landed property and general importance were second in that country , only to Sir Walter 's , and of good character and appearance ; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more , while Anne was nineteen , she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty - two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father 's house , and settled so permanently near herself .
Anne Elliot	But in this case , Anne had left nothing for advice to do ; and though Lady Russell , as satisfied as ever with her own discretion , never wished the past undone , she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne 's being tempted , by some man of talents and independence , to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits . They knew not each other 's opinion , either its constancy or its change , on the one leading point of Anne 's conduct , for the subject was never alluded to ; but Anne , at seven - and - twenty , thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen . She did not blame Lady Russell , she did not blame herself for having been guided by her ; but she felt that were any young person , in similar circumstances , to apply to her for counsel , they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness , such uncertain future good .
Anne Elliot	She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home , and every anxiety attending his profession , all their probable fears , delays , and disappointments , she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement , than she had been in the sacrifice of it ; and this , she fully believed , had the usual share , had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs , without reference to the actual results of their case , which , as it happened , would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on .
Anne Elliot	He had , very soon after their engagement ceased , got employ : and all that he had told her would follow , had taken place .
Anne Elliot	She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority , but she could not doubt his being rich ; and , in favour of his constancy , she had no reason to believe him married .
Anne Elliot	How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been !
Anne Elliot	how eloquent , at least , were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment , and a cheerful confidence in futurity , against that over - anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence ! She had been forced into prudence in her youth , she learned romance as she grew older : the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning .
Anne Elliot	With all these circumstances , recollections and feelings , she could not hear that Captain Wentworth 's sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain ; and many a stroll , and many a sigh , were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea .
Anne Elliot	She often told herself it was folly , before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no evil . She was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness , among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past , which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it .
Anne Elliot	She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell 's motives in this , over those of her father and Elizabeth ; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness ; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung ; and in the event of Admiral Croft 's really taking Kellynch Hall , she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her , of the past being known to
Anne Elliot	those three only among her connexions , by whom no syllable ,
Anne Elliot	she believed , would ever be whispered , and in the trust that among his , the brother only with whom he had been residing , had received
Anne Elliot	That brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man , and , moreover , a single man at the time , she had a fond dependence on no human creature 's having heard of it from him .
Anne Elliot	With these supports , she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the Crofts , which , with Lady Russell , still resident in Kellynch , and Mary fixed only three miles off , must be anticipated , need not involve any particular awkwardness .
Anne Elliot	From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the same circle .
Anne Elliot	They were soon dining in company together at Mr Musgrove 's , for the little boy 's state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself ; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings .
Anne Elliot	"His profession qualified him , his disposition lead him , to talk ; and "" That was in the year six ; "" "" That happened before I went to sea in the year six , "" occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together : and though his voice did not falter , and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke , Anne felt the utter impossibility , from her knowledge of his mind , that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself ."
Anne Elliot	There must be the same immediate association of thought , though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain .
Anne Elliot	With the exception , perhaps , of Admiral and Mrs Croft , who seemed particularly attached and happy , ( Anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples ) , there could have been no two hearts so open , no tastes so similar , no feelings so in unison , no countenances so beloved .
Anne Elliot	When he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind .
Anne Elliot	"There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party ; and he was very much questioned , and especially by the two Miss Musgroves , who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him , as to the manner of living on board , daily regulations , food , hours , & c. , and their surprise at his accounts , at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable , drew from him some pleasant ridicule , which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant , and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat , or any cook to dress it if there were , or any servant to wait , or any knife and fork to use . From thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Musgrove 's who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying-- "" Ah !"
Anne Elliot	Miss Anne , if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son
Anne Elliot	Anne suppressed a smile , and listened kindly , while Mrs Musgrove relieved her heart a little more ; and for a few minutes , therefore , could not keep pace with the conversation of the others .
Anne Elliot	When she could let her attention take its natural course again , she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List ( their own navy list , the first that had ever been at Uppercross ) , and sitting down together to pore over it , with the professed view of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded .
Anne Elliot	Anne 's shudderings were to herself alone ; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere , in their exclamations of pity and horror .
Anne Elliot	"I assure you , Captain Wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you . "" There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth 's face at this speech , a certain glance of his bright eye , and curl of his handsome mouth , which convinced Anne , that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove 's kind wishes , as to her son , he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him ; but it was too transient an indulgence of self - amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself ; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious , and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa , on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting , took a place by the latter , and entered into conversation with her , in a low voice , about her son , doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace , as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent 's feelings . They were actually on the same sofa , for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him ; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove ."
Anne Elliot	Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable , substantial size , infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour , than tenderness and sentiment ; and while the agitations of Anne 's slender form , and pensive face , may be considered as very completely screened , Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self - command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son , whom alive nobody had cared for . Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions .
Anne Elliot	"I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me , even at Kellynch Hall , "" ( with a kind bow to Anne ) , "" beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in ; and they have been five altogether ."
Anne Elliot	""" "" But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman , and as if women were all fine ladies , instead of rational creatures ."
Anne Elliot	On its being proposed , Anne offered her services , as usual ; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument , she was extremely glad to be employed , and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved .
Anne Elliot	It was a merry , joyous party , and no one seemed in higher spirits than Captain Wentworth . She felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference , and especially the attention of all the young women , could do .
Anne Elliot	The Miss Hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for Henrietta and Louisa , they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good - will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals . If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ? These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne , while her fingers were mechanically at work , proceeding for half an hour together , equally without error , and without consciousness . Once she felt that he was looking at herself , observing her altered features , perhaps , trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him ; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her ; she was hardly aware of it , till she heard the answer ; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced ?
Anne Elliot	"The answer was , "" Oh , no ; never ; she has quite given up dancing ."
Anne Elliot	She had rather play .
Anne Elliot	"She is never tired of playing . """
Anne Elliot	Once , too , he spoke to her .
Anne Elliot	She had left the instrument on the dancing being over , and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of .
Anne Elliot	"Unintentionally she returned to that part of the room ; he saw her , and , instantly rising , said , with studied politeness-- "" I beg your pardon , madam , this is your seat ; "" and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative , he was not to be induced to sit down again . Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches ."
Anne Elliot	12 Anne and Henrietta , finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning , agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast .
Anne Elliot	I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely , and fix at Lyme . Do not you , Anne ? Do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and Mrs Shirley ?
Anne Elliot	She has cousins here , you know , and many acquaintance , which would make it cheerful for her , and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand , in case of his having another seizure .
Anne Elliot	Do not you think , Anne , it is being over - scrupulous ?
Anne Elliot	Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience , when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties , which may be just as well performed by another person ?
Anne Elliot	"And at Lyme too , only seventeen miles off , he would be near enough to hear , if people thought there was anything to complain of . "" Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech , and entered into the subject , as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man , though here it was good of a lower standard , for what could be offered but general acquiescence ?"
Anne Elliot	"She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business ; felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought ; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active , respectable young man , as a resident curate , and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate 's being married . "" I wish , "" said Henrietta , very well pleased with her companion , "" I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross , and were intimate with Dr Shirley . I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody !"
Anne Elliot	"I am afraid of her , as I have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but I respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross . """
Anne Elliot	Anne was amused by Henrietta 's manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta 's views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them .
Anne Elliot	When they came to the steps , leading upwards from the beach , a gentleman , at the same moment preparing to come down , politely drew back , and stopped to give them way . They ascended and passed him ; and as they passed , Anne 's face caught his eye , and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration , which she could not be insensible of .
Anne Elliot	She was looking remarkably well ; her very regular , very pretty features , having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion , and by the animation of eye which it had also produced . It was evident that the gentleman , ( completely a gentleman in manner ) admired her exceedingly .
Anne Elliot	"Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it . He gave her a momentary glance , a glance of brightness , which seemed to say , "" That man is struck with you , and even I , at this moment , see something like Anne Elliot again . """
Anne Elliot	After attending Louisa through her business , and loitering about a little longer , they returned to the inn ; and Anne , in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining - room , had nearly run against the very same gentleman , as he came out of an adjoining apartment .
Anne Elliot	She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves , and determined that a well - looking groom , who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back , should be his servant .
Anne Elliot	Anne felt that she should like to know who he was .
Anne Elliot	The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own ; the servant in mourning roused Anne 's curiosity , and the whole six were collected to look , by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household , and taking his seat , to drive off .
Anne Elliot	""" Ah ! "" cried Captain Wentworth , instantly , and with half a glance at Anne , "" it is the very man we passed . """
Anne Elliot	"Many had looked on each other , and many had repeated the name , before all this had been got through , even by the smart rapidity of a waiter . "" Bless me ! "" cried Mary ; "" it must be our cousin ; it must be our Mr Elliot , it must , indeed ! Charles , Anne , must not it ? In mourning , you see , just as our Mr Elliot must be ."
Anne Elliot	Anne , must not it be our Mr Elliot ? my father 's next heir ?
Anne Elliot	"you see ! "" cried Mary in an ecstasy , "" just as I said !"
Anne Elliot	But , Anne , only conceive how extraordinary !
Anne Elliot	Do you think he had the Elliot countenance ?
Anne Elliot	""" Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together , "" said Captain Wentworth , "" we must consider it to be the arrangement of Providence , that you should not be introduced to your cousin . """
Anne Elliot	When she could command Mary 's attention , Anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not , for many years , been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable .
Anne Elliot	At the same time , however , it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin , and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman , and had an air of good sense .
Anne Elliot	She would not , upon any account , mention her having met with him the second time ; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk , but she would have felt quite ill - used by Anne 's having actually run against him in the passage , and received his very polite excuses , while she had never been near him at all ; no , that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret .
Anne Elliot	""" Of course , "" said Mary , "" you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot , the next time you write to Bath ."
Anne Elliot	"I think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him . "" Anne avoided a direct reply , but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated , but as what ought to be suppressed . The offence which had been given her father , many years back , she knew ; Elizabeth 's particular share in it she suspected ; and that Mr Elliot 's idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt ."
Anne Elliot	Mary never wrote to Bath herself ; all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell on Anne .
Anne Elliot	Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her , as soon as they were all fairly in the street .
Anne Elliot	Their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again ; and they walked together some time , talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron , and still as unable as before , and as unable as any other two readers , to think exactly alike of the merits of either , till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party , and instead of Captain Benwick , she had Captain Harville by her side .
Anne Elliot	""" Miss Elliot , "" said he , speaking rather low , "" you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much ."
Anne Elliot	""" No , "" said Anne , "" that I can easily believe to be impossible ; but in time , perhaps -- we know what time does in every case of affliction , and you must remember , Captain Harville , that your friend may yet be called a young mourner -- only last summer , I understand ."
Anne Elliot	"You may think , Miss Elliot , whether he is dear to us ! "" Anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different . Mrs Harville 's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home , determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk ; they would accompany them to their door , and then return and set off themselves ."
Anne Elliot	Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her .
Anne Elliot	"Lord Byron 's "" dark blue seas "" could not fail of being brought forward by their present view , and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible . It was soon drawn , perforce another way ."
Anne Elliot	"she is dead ! "" screamed Mary , catching hold of her husband , and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable ; and in another moment , Henrietta , sinking under the conviction , lost her senses too , and would have fallen on the steps , but for Captain Benwick and Anne , who caught and supported her between them ."
Anne Elliot	""" Go to him , go to him , "" cried Anne , "" for heaven 's sake go to him ."
Anne Elliot	I can support her myself .
Anne Elliot	Leave me , and go to him .
Anne Elliot	""" Captain Benwick obeyed , and Charles at the same moment , disengaging himself from his wife , they were both with him ; and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them , and everything was done that Anne had prompted , but in vain ;"
Anne Elliot	""" A surgeon ! "" said Anne ."
Anne Elliot	"He caught the word ; it seemed to rouse him at once , and saying only-- "" True , true , a surgeon this instant , "" was darting away , when Anne eagerly suggested-- "" Captain Benwick , would not it be better for Captain Benwick ? He knows where a surgeon is to be found . "" Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea , and in a moment ( it was all done in rapid moments ) Captain Benwick had resigned the poor corpse - like figure entirely to the brother 's care , and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity ."
Anne Elliot	As to the wretched party left behind , it could scarcely be said which of the three , who were completely rational , was suffering most : Captain Wentworth , Anne , or Charles , who , really a very affectionate brother , hung over Louisa with sobs of grief , and could only turn his eyes from one sister , to see the other in a state as insensible , or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife , calling on him
Anne Elliot	Anne , attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to Henrietta , still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet Mary , to animate Charles , to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth .
Anne Elliot	Both seemed to look to her for directions .
Anne Elliot	""" Anne , Anne , "" cried Charles , "" What is to be done next ?"
Anne Elliot	"Captain Wentworth 's eyes were also turned towards her . "" Had not she better be carried to the inn ?"
Anne Elliot	To some of the best - looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned , for , though partially revived , she was quite helpless ; and in this manner , Anne walking by her side , and Charles attending to his wife , they set forward , treading back with feelings unutterable , the ground , which so lately , so very lately , and so light of heart , they had passed along .
Anne Elliot	"The tone , the look , with which "" Thank God ! "" was uttered by Captain Wentworth , Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her ; nor the sight of him afterwards , as he sat near a table , leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed , as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul , and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them ."
Anne Elliot	The plan had reached this point , when Anne , coming quietly down from Louisa 's room , could not but hear what followed , for the parlour door was open .
Anne Elliot	Mrs Charles Musgrove will , of course , wish to get back to her children ; but if Anne will stay , no one so proper , so capable as Anne .
Anne Elliot	She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of .
Anne Elliot	The other two warmly agreed with what he said , and she then appeared .
Anne Elliot	""" You will stay , I am sure ; you will stay and nurse her ; "" cried he , turning to her and speaking with a glow , and yet a gentleness , which seemed almost restoring the past ."
Anne Elliot	She coloured deeply , and he recollected himself and moved away .
Anne Elliot	She expressed herself most willing , ready , happy to remain .
Anne Elliot	She was so wretched and so vehement , complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of Anne ; Anne , who was nothing to Louisa , while she was her sister , and had the best right to stay in Henrietta 's stead !
Anne Elliot	Why was not she to be as useful as Anne ?
Anne Elliot	And to go home without Charles , too , without her husband !
Anne Elliot	No , it was too unkind . And in short , she said more than her husband could long withstand , and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way , there was no help for it ; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable .
Anne Elliot	Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of Mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , Charles taking care of his sister , and Captain Benwick attending to her . She gave a moment 's recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . There she had listened to Henrietta 's schemes for Dr Shirley 's leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen Mr Elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa , or those who were wrapt up in her welfare . Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance .
Anne Elliot	Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them , and a chaise and four in waiting , stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street ; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other , the change in his countenance , the astonishment , the expressions begun and suppressed , with which Charles was listened to , made but a mortifying reception of Anne ; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa .
Anne Elliot	She endeavoured to be composed , and to be just .
Anne Elliot	Without emulating the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry , she would have attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard , for his sake ; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend .
Anne Elliot	In the mean while she was in the carriage .
Anne Elliot	He had handed them both in , and placed himself between them ; and in this manner , under these circumstances , full of astonishment and emotion to Anne , she quitted Lyme .
Anne Elliot	How the long stage would pass ; how it was to affect their manners ; what was to be their sort of intercourse , she could not foresee .
Anne Elliot	Once only , when she had been grieving over the last ill - judged , ill - fated walk to the Cobb , bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of , he burst forth , as if wholly overcome--
Anne Elliot	Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now , to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character ; and whether it might not strike him that , like all other qualities of the mind , it should have its proportions and limits . She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character .
Anne Elliot	Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon .
Anne Elliot	It was growing quite dusk , however , before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross , and there had been total silence among them for some time , Henrietta leaning back in the corner , with a shawl over her face , giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep ; when , as they were going up their last hill , Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth .
Anne Elliot	I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her , while I go in and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove .
Anne Elliot	"Do you think this is a good plan ? "" She did : he was satisfied , and said no more . But the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her , as a proof of friendship , and of deference for her judgement , a great pleasure ; and when it became a sort of parting proof , its value did not lessen ."
Anne Elliot	The remainder of Anne 's time at Uppercross , comprehending only two days , was spent entirely at the Mansion House ; and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there , both as an immediate companion , and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future , which , in Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's distressed state of spirits , would have been difficulties .
Anne Elliot	A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne , and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery - maid of the family , one who having brought up all the children , and seen the very last , the lingering and long - petted Master Harry , sent to school after his brothers , was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her , and who , consequently , was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa . Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither , had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta ; but without Anne , it would hardly have been resolved on , and found practicable so soon .
Anne Elliot	Anne was to leave them on the morrow , an event which they all dreaded .
Anne Elliot	And so much was said in this way , that Anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy , and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once .
Anne Elliot	She had little difficulty ; it was soon determined that they would go ; go to - morrow , fix themselves at the inn , or get into lodgings , as it suited , and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved .
Anne Elliot	They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that Anne was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence . She was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character . A few days had made a change indeed ! If Louisa recovered , it would all be well again .
Anne Elliot	There could not be a doubt , to her mind there was none , of what would follow her recovery .
Anne Elliot	A few months hence , and the room now so deserted , occupied but by her silent , pensive self , might be filled again with all that was happy and gay , all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love , all that was most unlike Anne Elliot !
Anne Elliot	An hour 's complete leisure for such reflections as these , on a dark November day , a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows , was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell 's carriage exceedingly welcome ; and yet , though desirous to be gone , she could not quit the Mansion House , or look an adieu to the Cottage , with its black , dripping and comfortless veranda , or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village , without a saddened heart .
Anne Elliot	She left it all behind her , all but the recollection that such things had been .
Anne Elliot	Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell 's house in September . It had not been necessary , and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and escape from .
Anne Elliot	Her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the Lodge , and to gladden the eyes of its mistress .
Anne Elliot	There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell 's joy in meeting her .
Anne Elliot	She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross . But happily , either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks , or Lady Russell fancied her so ; and Anne , in receiving her compliments on the occasion , had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin , and of hoping that she was to be blessed with
Anne Elliot	When they came to converse , she was soon sensible of some mental change .
Anne Elliot	The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch , and which she had felt slighted , and been compelled to smother among the Musgroves , were now become but of secondary interest .
Anne Elliot	She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath .
Anne Elliot	Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father 's house in Camden Place , or her own sister 's intimacy with Mrs Clay . She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her .
Anne Elliot	Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell .
Anne Elliot	She could not speak the name , and look straight forward to Lady Russell 's eye , till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa .
Anne Elliot	When this was told , his name distressed her no longer .
Anne Elliot	"The first three or four days passed most quietly , with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme , which found their way to Anne , she could not tell how , and brought a rather improving account of Louisa . At the end of that period , Lady Russell 's politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self - threatenings of the past became in a decided tone , "" I must call on Mrs Croft ; I really must call upon her soon . Anne , have you courage to go with me , and pay a visit in that house ?"
Anne Elliot	"It will be some trial to us both . "" Anne did not shrink from it ; on the contrary , she truly felt as she said , in observing-- "" I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two ; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine ."
Anne Elliot	"She could have said more on the subject ; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts , and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants , felt the parish to be so sure of a good example , and the poor of the best attention and relief , that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal , she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay , and that Kellynch Hall had passed into better hands than its owners ' . These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain , and severe was its kind ; but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again , and returning through the well - known apartments . In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself , "" These rooms ought to belong only to us . Oh , how fallen in their destination ! How unworthily occupied !"
Anne Elliot	No , except when she thought of her mother , and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside , she had no sigh of that description to heave .
Anne Elliot	Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite , and on the present occasion , receiving her in that house , there was particular attention .
Anne Elliot	The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ) , had brought Anne the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more . He had enquired after her , she found , particularly ; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot 's not being the worse for her exertions , and had spoken of those exertions as great . This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done . As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove 's recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter !
Anne Elliot	A new sort of way this , for a young fellow to be making love , by breaking his mistress 's head , is not it , Miss Elliot ?
Anne Elliot	"This is breaking a head and giving a plaster , truly ! "" Admiral Croft 's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell , but they delighted Anne ."
Anne Elliot	"His goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible . "" Now , this must be very bad for you , "" said he , suddenly rousing from a little reverie , "" to be coming and finding us here ."
Anne Elliot	"Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it . "" "" Another time , Sir , I thank you , not now ."
Anne Elliot	""" "" Well , whenever it suits you . You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time ; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door ."
Anne Elliot	"But , "" ( checking himself ) , "" you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler 's room ."
Anne Elliot	"And so you must judge for yourself , whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not . "" Anne , finding she might decline it , did so , very gratefully . """
Anne Elliot	We told you about the laundry - door , at Uppercross .
Anne Elliot	You will tell Sir Walter what we have done , and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had . Indeed , I must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better . My wife should have the credit of them , however .
Anne Elliot	I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking - glasses from my dressing - room , which was your father 's .
Anne Elliot	"A very good man , and very much the gentleman I am sure : but I should think , Miss Elliot , "" ( looking with serious reflection ) , "" I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life ."
Anne Elliot	"Anne , amused in spite of herself , was rather distressed for an answer , and the Admiral , fearing he might not have been civil enough , took up the subject again , to say-- "" The next time you write to your good father , Miss Elliot , pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft 's , and say that we are settled here quite to our liking , and have no fault at all to find with the place ."
Anne Elliot	The breakfast - room chimney smokes a little , I grant you , but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard , which may not happen three times a winter .
Anne Elliot	Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other : but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present ; for when it was returned , the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks , to visit their connexions in the north of the county , and probably might not be at home again before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath . So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall , or of seeing him in company with her friend .
Anne Elliot	Everything was safe enough , and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject .
Anne Elliot	5 On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft 's seeing Kellynch Hall , Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell 's , and keep out of the way till all was over ; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them . This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory , and decided the whole business at once .
Anne Elliot	"Sir Walter , without hesitation , declared the Admiral to be the best - looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and the Admiral , with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park , "" I thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at Taunton . The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him . """
Anne Elliot	Lady Russell , convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use , or any importance , in the choice of the house which they were going to secure , was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon , and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas ; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks , she was unable to give the full invitation she wished , and
Anne Elliot	Anne though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath , and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country , did not think that , everything considered , she wished to remain . It would be most right , and most wise , and , therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others . Something occurred , however , to give her a different duty .
Anne Elliot	Mary , often a little unwell , and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints , and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was the matter , was indisposed ; and foreseeing that she should not have a day 's health all the autumn , entreated , or rather required her , for it was hardly entreaty , to come to Uppercross Cottage , and bear her company as long as she should want her , instead of going to Bath .
Anne Elliot	""" I can not possibly do without Anne , "" was Mary 's reasoning ; and Elizabeth 's reply was , "" Then I am sure Anne had better stay , for nobody will want her in Bath ."
Anne Elliot	To be claimed as a good , though in an improper style , is at least better than being rejected as no good at all ; and Anne , glad to be thought of some use , glad to have anything marked out as a duty , and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country , and her own dear country , readily agreed to stay .
Anne Elliot	This invitation of Mary 's removed all Lady Russell 's difficulties , and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her , and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge .
Anne Elliot	So far all was perfectly right ; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan , when it burst on her , which was , Mrs Clay 's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth , as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her .
Anne Elliot	Lady Russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all , wondered , grieved , and feared ; and the affront it contained to Anne , in Mrs Clay 's being of so much use , while Anne could be of none , was a very sore aggravation .
Anne Elliot	Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts ; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell .
Anne Elliot	With a great deal of quiet observation , and a knowledge , which she often wished less , of her father 's character , she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible . She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind .
Anne Elliot	Mrs Clay had freckles , and a projecting tooth , and a clumsy wrist , which he was continually making severe remarks upon , in her absence ; but she was young , and certainly altogether well - looking , and possessed , in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners , infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been .
Anne Elliot	Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger , that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister .
Anne Elliot	She had little hope of success ; but Elizabeth , who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself , should never , she thought ,
Anne Elliot	have reason to reproach her for giving no warning .
Anne Elliot	""" Mrs Clay , "" said she , warmly , "" never forgets who she is ; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , I can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people ."
Anne Elliot	If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman , I grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , I am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy .
Anne Elliot	But poor Mrs Clay who , with all her merits , can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty , I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety .
Anne Elliot	One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes , though I know you must fifty times .
Anne Elliot	That tooth of her 's and those freckles . Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him .
Anne Elliot	You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay 's freckles .
Anne Elliot	""" There is hardly any personal defect , "" replied Anne , "" which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to ."
Anne Elliot	However , at any rate , as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have , I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me .
Anne Elliot	""" Anne had done ; glad that it was over , and not absolutely hopeless of doing good ."
Anne Elliot	The last office of the four carriage - horses was to draw Sir Walter , Miss Elliot , and Mrs Clay to Bath .
Anne Elliot	Anne walked up at the same time , in a sort of desolate tranquillity , to the Lodge , where she was to spend the first week . Her friend was not in better spirits than herself .
Anne Elliot	It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds , and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into ; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village , and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived , she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne .
Anne Elliot	Accordingly their removal was made together , and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage , in the first stage of Lady Russell 's journey . Uppercross was a moderate - sized village , which a few years back had been completely in the old English style , containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers ; the mansion of the squire , with its high walls , great gates , and old trees , substantial and unmodernized , and the compact , tight parsonage , enclosed in its own neat garden , with a vine and a pear - tree trained round its casements ; but upon the marriage of the young ' squire , it had received the improvement of a farm - house elevated into a cottage , for his residence , and Uppercross Cottage , with its veranda , French windows , and other prettiness , was quite as likely to catch the traveller 's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House , about a quarter of a mile farther on .
Anne Elliot	Here Anne had often been staying .
Anne Elliot	She knew the ways of Uppercross as well as those of Kellynch .
Anne Elliot	The two families were so continually meeting , so much in the habit of running in and out of each other 's house at all hours , that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone ; but being alone , her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course .
Anne Elliot	Though better endowed than the elder sister , Mary had not Anne 's understanding nor temper .
Anne Elliot	While well , and happy , and properly attended to , she had great good humour and excellent spirits ; but any indisposition sunk her completely .
Anne Elliot	She had no resources for solitude ; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot self - importance , was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill - used .
Anne Elliot	"In person , she was inferior to both sisters , and had , even in her bloom , only reached the dignity of being "" a fine girl . """
Anne Elliot	"She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing - room , the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby , under the influence of four summers and two children ; and , on Anne 's appearing , greeted her with-- "" So , you are come at last !"
Anne Elliot	I began to think I should never see you .
Anne Elliot	I am so ill I can hardly speak . I have not seen a creature the whole morning !
Anne Elliot	""" I am sorry to find you unwell , "" replied Anne ."
Anne Elliot	""" You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday ! """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes , I made the best of it ; I always do : but I was very far from well at the time ; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning : very unfit to be left alone , I am sure ."
Anne Elliot	Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way , and not able to ring the bell !
Anne Elliot	"I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer . "" Anne said what was proper , and enquired after her husband ."
Anne Elliot	I have not seen him since seven o'clock .
Anne Elliot	He would go , though I told him how ill I was .
Anne Elliot	I assure you , I have not seen a soul this whole long morning .
Anne Elliot	""" "" You have had your little boys with you ? """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes , as long as I could bear their noise ; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good . Little Charles does not mind a word I say , and Walter is growing quite as bad . """
Anne Elliot	""" Well , you will soon be better now , "" replied Anne , cheerfully ."
Anne Elliot	""" You know I always cure you when I come ."
Anne Elliot	How are your neighbours at the Great House ?
Anne Elliot	""" "" I can give you no account of them . I have not seen one of them to - day , except Mr Musgrove , who just stopped and spoke through the window , but without getting off his horse ; and though I told him how ill I was , not one of them have been near me ."
Anne Elliot	It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves , I suppose , and they never put themselves out of their way .
Anne Elliot	"It is early . "" "" I never want them , I assure you ."
Anne Elliot	They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me .
Anne Elliot	Anne , I am so very unwell !
Anne Elliot	"It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday . "" "" My dear Mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself !"
Anne Elliot	"You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner . """
Anne Elliot	""" Dear me !"
Anne Elliot	"what can you possibly have to do ? "" "" A great many things , I assure you ."
Anne Elliot	More than I can recollect in a moment ; but I can tell you some .
Anne Elliot	I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father 's books and pictures .
Anne Elliot	I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie , trying to understand , and make him understand , which of Elizabeth 's plants are for Lady Russell .
Anne Elliot	I have had all my own little concerns to arrange , books and music to divide , and all my trunks to repack , from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons : and one thing I have had to do , Mary , of a more trying nature : going to almost every house in the parish , as a sort of take - leave . I was told that they wished it . But all these things took up a great deal of time .
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! well ! "" and after a moment 's pause , "" but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday ."
Anne Elliot	""" Did you go then ?"
Anne Elliot	I have made no enquiries , because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party .
Anne Elliot	I went .
Anne Elliot	I was very well yesterday ; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning .
Anne Elliot	It would have been strange if I had not gone .
Anne Elliot	""" I am very glad you were well enough , and I hope you had a pleasant party . """
Anne Elliot	""" Nothing remarkable . One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one 's own . Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me , and we were so crowded ! They are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward ."
Anne Elliot	"So , there was I , crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louise ; and I think it very likely that my illness to - day may be owing to it . """
Anne Elliot	"A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Anne 's side produced nearly a cure on Mary 's . She could soon sit upright on the sofa , and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner - time . Then , forgetting to think of it , she was at the other end of the room , beautifying a nosegay ; then , she ate her cold meat ; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk . "" Where shall we go ? "" said she , when they were ready ."
Anne Elliot	""" I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you ?"
Anne Elliot	""" I have not the smallest objection on that account , "" replied Anne ."
Anne Elliot	""" I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves . """
Anne Elliot	but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible .
Anne Elliot	They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister .
Anne Elliot	Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent ; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it , from believing that , though there were on each side continual subjects of offence , neither family could now do without it .
Anne Elliot	The father and mother were in the old English style , and the young people in the new .
Anne Elliot	Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance ; but still , saved as we all are , by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange , she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments ; and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together , that good - humoured mutual affection , of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters . They were received with great cordiality .
Anne Elliot	Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family , which was generally , as Anne very well knew , the least to blame .
Anne Elliot	The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough ; and she was not at all surprised at the end of it , to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves , at Mary 's particular invitation .
Mary Musgrove	"She had never been staying there before , without being struck by it , or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown , or unconsidered there , were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest ; yet , with all this experience , she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson , in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle , was become necessary for her ; for certainly , coming as she did , with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks , she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove : "" So , Miss Anne , Sir Walter and your sister are gone ; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in ? "" and this , without much waiting for an answer ; or in the young ladies ' addition of , "" I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter ; but remember , papa , if we do go , we must be in a good situation : none of your Queen Squares for us ! "" or in the anxious supplement from Mary , of-- "" Upon my word , I shall be pretty well off , when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath !"
Mary Musgrove	Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth , nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort . She was always on friendly terms with her brother - in - law ; and in the children , who loved her nearly as well , and respected her a great deal more than their mother , she had an object of interest , amusement , and wholesome exertion . Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits . As it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else .
Mary Musgrove	He had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife 's occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne 's admiration , and
Mary Musgrove	upon the whole , though there was very often a little disagreement ( in which she had sometimes more share than she wished , being appealed to by both parties ) , they might pass for a happy couple .
Mary Musgrove	for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made , he always contended for his father 's having many other uses for his money , and a right to spend it as he liked .
Mary Musgrove	As to the management of their children , his theory was much better than his wife 's , and his practice not so bad .
Mary Musgrove	""" I could manage them very well , if it were not for Mary 's interference , "" was what Anne often heard him say , and had a good deal of faith in ; but when listening in turn to Mary 's reproach of "" Charles spoils the children so that I can not get them into any order , "" she never had the smallest temptation to say , "" Very true . """
Mary Musgrove	"Known to have some influence with her sister , she was continually requested , or at least receiving hints to exert it , beyond what was practicable . "" I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill , "" was Charles 's language ; and , in an unhappy mood , thus spoke Mary : "" I do believe if Charles were to see me dying , he would not think there was anything the matter with me ."
Mary Musgrove	I am sure , Anne , if you would , you might persuade him that I really am very ill -- a great deal worse than I ever own .
Mary Musgrove	""" Mary 's declaration was , "" I hate sending the children to the Great House , though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them , for she humours and indulges them to such a degree , and gives them so much trash and sweet things , that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day . """
Mary Musgrove	She had this communication , moreover , from Mary .
Mary Musgrove	"If Jemima were not the trustiest , steadiest creature in the world , it would be enough to spoil her ; for she tells me , they are always tempting her to take a walk with them . "" And on Mrs Musgrove 's side , it was , "" I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter - in - law 's concerns , for I know it would not do ; but I shall tell you , Miss Anne , because you may be able to set things to rights , that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles 's nursery - maid : I hear strange stories of her ; she is always upon the gad ; and from my own knowledge , I can declare , she is such a fine - dressing lady , that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near ."
Mary Musgrove	"Again , it was Mary 's complaint , that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the Great House with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place . And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves , one of them after talking of rank , people of rank , and jealousy of rank , said , "" I have no scruple of observing to you , how nonsensical some persons are about their place , because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it ; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious , especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma . Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma , but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it ."
Mary Musgrove	Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject , by being removed three miles from Kellynch ; Mary 's ailments lessened by having a constant companion , and their daily intercourse with the other family , since there was neither superior affection , confidence , nor employment in the cottage , to be interrupted by it , was rather an advantage . It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible , for they met every morning , and hardly ever spent an evening asunder ; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's respectable forms in the usual places , or without the talking , laughing , and singing of their daughters .
Mary Musgrove	She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves , but having no voice , no knowledge of the harp , and no fond parents , to sit by and fancy themselves delighted , her performance was little thought of , only out of civility , or to refresh the others , as she was well aware . She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself ; but this was no new sensation .
Mary Musgrove	Excepting one short period of her life , she had never , since the age of fourteen , never since the loss of her dear mother , known the happiness of being listened to , or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste .
Mary Musgrove	In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world ; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's fond partiality for their own daughters ' performance , and total indifference to any other person 's , gave her much more pleasure for their sakes , than mortification for her own .
Mary Musgrove	"She could not think of much else on the 29th of September ; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary , who , on having occasion to note down the day of the month , exclaimed , "" Dear me , is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch ?"
Mary Musgrove	I am glad I did not think of it before .
Mary Musgrove	"How low it makes me ! """
Mary Musgrove	"Mary deplored the necessity for herself . "" Nobody knew how much she should suffer ."
Mary Musgrove	She wished , however to see the Crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned . They came : the master of the house was not at home , but the two sisters were together ; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne , while the Admiral sat by Mary , and made himself very agreeable by his good - humoured notice of her little boys , she was well able to watch for a likeness , and if it failed her in the features , to catch it in the voice , or in the turn of sentiment and expression . Mrs Croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person . She had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather - beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight - and - thirty . Her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour .
Mary Musgrove	"The rest was all tranquillity ; till , just as they were moving , she heard the Admiral say to Mary-- "" We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft 's here soon ; I dare say you know him by name . """
Mary Musgrove	"The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage ; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot , the coach was beginning to be listened for , when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in . That she was coming to apologize , and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves , was the first black idea ; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted , when Louisa made all right by saying , that she only came on foot , to leave more room for the harp , which was bringing in the carriage . "" And I will tell you our reason , "" she added , "" and all about it . I am come on to give you notice , that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening , especially mamma ; she is thinking so much of poor Richard !"
Mary Musgrove	I will tell you why she is out of spirits . When the Crofts called this morning , ( they called here afterwards , did not they ? ) , they happened to say , that her brother , Captain Wentworth , is just returned to England , or paid off , or something , and is coming to see them almost directly ; and most unluckily it came into mamma 's head , when they were gone , that Wentworth , or something very like it , was the name of poor Richard 's captain at one time ; I do not know when or where , but a great while before he died , poor fellow ! And upon looking over his letters and things , she found it was so , and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man , and her head is quite full of it , and of poor Richard ! So we must be as merry as we can , that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things .
Mary Musgrove	It was Mary 's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from Henrietta , and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to - morrow . Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was wise .
Mary Musgrove	"It was a very fine November day , and the Miss Musgroves came through the little grounds , and stopped for no other purpose than to say , that they were going to take a long walk , and therefore concluded Mary could not like to go with them ; and when Mary immediately replied , with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker , "" Oh , yes , I should like to join you very much , I am very fond of a long walk ; "" Anne felt persuaded , by the looks of the two girls , that it was precisely what they did not wish , and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce , of everything being to be communicated , and everything being to be done together , however undesired and inconvenient ."
Mary Musgrove	She tried to dissuade Mary from going , but in vain ; and that being the case , thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves ' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise , as she might be useful in turning back with her sister , and lessening the interference in any plan of their own .
Mary Musgrove	""" I can not imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk , "" said Mary , as she went up stairs . "" Everybody is always supposing that I am not a good walker ; and yet they would not have been pleased , if we had refused to join them . When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us , how can one say no ? """
Mary Musgrove	Anne 's object was , not to be in the way of anybody ; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary , to keep with her brother and sister .
Mary Musgrove	Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister .
Mary Musgrove	"After one of the many praises of the day , which were continually bursting forth , Captain Wentworth added : -- "" What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister !"
Mary Musgrove	it does happen very often , I assure you ; but my sister makes nothing of it ; she would as lieve be tossed out as not .
Mary Musgrove	"You make the most of it , I know , "" cried Louisa , "" but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place . If I loved a man , as she loves the Admiral , I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else . "" It was spoken with enthusiasm . "" Had you ? "" cried he , catching the same tone ; "" I honour you ! """
Mary Musgrove	"Mary exclaimed , "" Bless me !"
Mary Musgrove	I declare I had no idea !
Mary Musgrove	"Well now , I think we had better turn back ; I am excessively tired . "" Henrietta , conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as Mary wished ; but "" No ! "" said Charles Musgrove , and "" No , no ! "" cried Louisa more eagerly , and taking her sister aside , seemed to be arguing the matter warmly ."
Mary Musgrove	"Charles , in the meanwhile , was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt , now that he was so near ; and very evidently , though more fearfully , trying to induce his wife to go too . But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength ; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop , as she felt so tired , she resolutely answered , "" Oh ! no , indeed !"
Mary Musgrove	"walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good ; "" and , in short , her look and manner declared , that go she would not ."
Mary Musgrove	"Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to Henrietta , Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to Captain Wentworth-- "" It is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life . "" She received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of ."
Mary Musgrove	The brow of the hill , where they remained , was a cheerful spot : Louisa returned ; and Mary , finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile , was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her ; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away , to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge - row , and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound , Mary was happy no longer
Mary Musgrove	Anne found a nice seat for her , on a dry sunny bank , under the hedge - row , in which she had no doubt of their still being , in some spot or other .
Mary Musgrove	Mary sat down for a moment , but it would not do ; she was sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else , and she would go on
Mary Musgrove	"What Anne first heard was-- "" And so , I made her go . I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . What !"
Mary Musgrove	After the hints you gave just now , which did but confirm my own observations , the last time I was in company with him , I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on . I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this . Your sister is an amiable creature ; but yours is the character of decision and firmness , I see .
Mary Musgrove	If you value her conduct or happiness , infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can . But this , no doubt , you have been always doing .
Mary Musgrove	If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life , she will cherish all her present powers of mind .
Mary Musgrove	"While she remained , a bush of low rambling holly protected her , and they were moving on . Before they were beyond her hearing , however , Louisa spoke again . "" Mary is good - natured enough in many respects , "" said she ; "" but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride -- the Elliot pride ."
Mary Musgrove	She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride .
Mary Musgrove	""" I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary ."
Mary Musgrove	As soon as she could , she went after Mary , and having found , and walked back with her to their former station , by the stile , felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected , and once more in motion together .
Mary Musgrove	She joined Charles and Mary , and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles 's other arm ; but Charles , though in very good humour with her , was out of temper with his wife .
Mary Musgrove	Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him , and was now to reap the consequence , which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch ; and when Mary began to complain of it , and lament her being ill - used , according to custom , in being on the hedge side , while Anne was never incommoded on the other , he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of , and they could hardly get him along at all .
Mary Musgrove	The invitation was general , and generally declined . The Miss Musgroves were not at all tired , and Mary was either offended , by not being asked before any of the others , or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise .
Mary Musgrove	The walking party had crossed the lane , and were surmounting an opposite stile , and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again , when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister . The something might be guessed by its effects .
Mary Musgrove	She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House , where , as she afterwards learnt , they must inevitably have found him , when they were stopped by the eldest boy 's being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall . The child 's situation put the visit entirely aside ; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference , even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account .
Mary Musgrove	"Anne will send for me if anything is the matter . "" Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain . Mary knew , from Charles 's manner of speaking , that he was quite determined on going , and that it would be of no use to teaze him ."
Mary Musgrove	I perfectly understand Mr Robinson 's directions , and have no fears ; and indeed , Mary , I can not wonder at your husband .
Mary Musgrove	"Mr and Mrs Musgrove can not think it wrong while I remain with him . "" "" Are you serious ? "" cried Mary , her eyes brightening ."
Mary Musgrove	""" Dear me ! that 's a very good thought , very good , indeed ."
Mary Musgrove	"I should not go , you may be sure , if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child . "" The next moment she was tapping at her husband 's dressing - room door , and as Anne followed her up stairs , she was in time for the whole conversation , which began with Mary 's saying , in a tone of great exultation-- "" I mean to go with you , Charles , for I am of no more use at home than you are ."
Mary Musgrove	If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child , I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like .
Mary Musgrove	It is Anne 's own proposal , and so I shall go with you , which will be a great deal better , for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday .
Mary Musgrove	The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child 's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice . Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over .
Mary Musgrove	Her eye half met Captain Wentworth 's , a bow , a curtsey passed ; she heard his voice ; he talked to Mary , said all that was right , said something to the Miss Musgroves , enough to mark an easy footing ; the room seemed full , full of persons and voices , but a few minutes ended it .
Mary Musgrove	Mary talked , but she could not attend .
Mary Musgrove	"On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented , she was soon spared all suspense ; for , after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary : -- "" Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you , Anne , though he was so attentive to me ."
Mary Musgrove	"Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister 's in a common way , but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound . "" Altered beyond his knowledge . """
Mary Musgrove	Mary had had her evils ; but upon the whole , as was evident by her staying so long , she had found more to enjoy than to suffer .
Mary Musgrove	No , these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures ; her spirits rose under their influence ; and like Mrs Musgrove , she was feeling , though not saying , that after being long in the country , nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness .
Mary Musgrove	They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove , and were at the White Hart . So much was pretty soon understood ; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing - room , and regaling themselves with her admiration , Anne could not draw upon Charles 's brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary , as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of .
Mary Musgrove	but Mary could not bear to be left , and had made herself so unhappy about it , that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense , or at an end .
Mary Musgrove	Anne 's only surprise was , that affairs should be in forwardness enough for Henrietta 's wedding - clothes to be talked of . She had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand ; but she learned from Charles that , very recently , ( since Mary 's last letter to herself ) , Charles Hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years ; and that on the strength of his present income , with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question , the two families had consented to the young people 's wishes , and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months , quite as soon as Louisa 's .
Mary Musgrove	Mary does not above half like Henrietta 's match .
Mary Musgrove	Mary was in excellent spirits , enjoying the gaiety and the change , and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother - in - law 's carriage with four horses , and with her own complete independence of Camden Place , that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought , and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house , as they were detailed to her .
Mary Musgrove	She had no demands on her father or sister , and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing - rooms .
Mary Musgrove	She felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them ; but she could not bear to have the difference of style , the reduction of servants , which a dinner must betray , witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch .
Mary Musgrove	, Mary was as completely satisfied .
Mary Musgrove	She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot , and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , who were fortunately already engaged to come ; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention .
Mary Musgrove	Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning ; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary , to go and see her and Henrietta directly . Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present .
Mary Musgrove	They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within , and by themselves , and Anne had the kindest welcome from each .
Mary Musgrove	It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on Charles 's leaving them together , was listening to Mrs Musgrove 's history of Louisa , and to Henrietta 's of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which Mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill - used by anybody ; which Mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining .
Mary Musgrove	""" Anne , "" cried Mary , still at her window , "" there is Mrs Clay , I am sure , standing under the colonnade , and a gentleman with her ."
Mary Musgrove	I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now .
Mary Musgrove	Come , and tell me .
Mary Musgrove	I recollect .
Mary Musgrove	"It is Mr Elliot himself . "" "" No , "" cried Anne , quickly , "" it can not be Mr Elliot , I assure you ."
Mary Musgrove	"He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to - morrow . "" As she spoke , she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her , the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her , and made her regret that she had said so much , simple as it was . Mary , resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin , began talking very warmly about the family features , and protesting still more positively that it was Mr Elliot , calling again upon Anne to come and look for herself , but Anne did not mean to stir , and tried to be cool and unconcerned ."
Mary Musgrove	""" Do come , Anne "" cried Mary , "" come and look yourself ."
Mary Musgrove	""" To pacify Mary , and perhaps screen her own embarrassment , Anne did move quietly to the window ."
Mary Musgrove	"Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play , if Henrietta and all the others liked it , when Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming-- "" Good heavens , Charles ! how can you think of such a thing ?"
Mary Musgrove	We are quite near relations , you know ; and Mr Elliot too , whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with !
Mary Musgrove	The careless expression was life to Anne , who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention , looking and listening with his whole soul ; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself . Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style ; he , half serious and half jesting , maintaining the scheme for the play , and she , invariably serious , most warmly opposing it , and not omitting to make it known that , however determined to go to Camden Place herself , she should not think herself very well used , if they went to the play without her . Mrs Musgrove interposed .
Mary Musgrove	"Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness ; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying-- "" If it depended only on my inclination , ma'am , the party at home ( excepting on Mary 's account ) would not be the smallest impediment ."
Mary Musgrove	""" Only think of Elizabeth 's including everybody ! "" whispered Mary very audibly ."
Mary Musgrove	""" I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted !"
Mary Musgrove	He was full of ` to - morrow , ' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have
Mary Musgrove	She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated .
Mary Musgrove	It was three weeks since she had heard at all . She only knew that Henrietta was at home again ; and that Louisa , though considered to be recovering fast , was still in Lyme ; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening , when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to her ; and , to quicken the pleasure and surprise , with Admiral and Mrs Croft 's compliments .
Mary Musgrove	""" Mary need not have feared her sister 's being in any degree prepared for the news ."
Mary Musgrove	She had never in her life been more astonished .
Mary Musgrove	It was almost too wonderful for belief , and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room , preserve an air of calmness , and answer the common questions of the moment . Happily for her , they were not many .
Mary Musgrove	"Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond . "" How is Mary ? "" said Elizabeth ; and without waiting for an answer ,"
Mary Musgrove	Elizabeth , may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place ?
Mary Musgrove	That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary , from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself .
Mary Musgrove	That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary , from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself .
Mary Musgrove	She did not mean , however , to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity , than Mary might have allowed . She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment .
Mary Musgrove	Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife .
Mary Musgrove	She , poor soul , is tied by the leg .
Mary Musgrove	She has a blister on one of her heels , as large as a three - shilling piece .
Mary Musgrove	Look , he sees us ; he kisses his hand to you ; he takes you for my wife .
Mary Musgrove	She therefore satisfied herself with common - place remarks or quiet attention , and the Admiral had it all his own way .
Mary Musgrove	""" How is Mary looking ? "" said Sir Walter , in the height of his good humour ."
Mary Musgrove	""" The last time I saw her she had a red nose , but I hope that may not happen every day ."
Mary Musgrove	In general she has been in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas .
Mary Musgrove	""" If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , I would send her a new hat and pelisse . "" Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown , or a cap , would not be liable to any such misuse , when a knock at the door suspended everything ."
Mary Musgrove	"Anne drew a little back , while the others received his compliments , and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour , but "" he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before , "" & c. & c ; which was all as politely done , and as politely taken , as possible , but her part must follow then . Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter ; "" Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter "" ( there was no occasion for remembering Mary ) ; and Anne , smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was ."
Mary Musgrove	"Many had looked on each other , and many had repeated the name , before all this had been got through , even by the smart rapidity of a waiter . "" Bless me ! "" cried Mary ; "" it must be our cousin ; it must be our Mr Elliot , it must , indeed ! Charles , Anne , must not it ? In mourning , you see , just as our Mr Elliot must be ."
Mary Musgrove	"you see ! "" cried Mary in an ecstasy , "" just as I said !"
Mary Musgrove	I was sure that would come out , if it was so .
Mary Musgrove	I wish I had looked at him more .
Mary Musgrove	I wish we had been aware in time , who it was , that he might have been introduced to us .
Mary Musgrove	I hardly looked at him , I was looking at the horses ; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance , I wonder the arms did not strike me !
Mary Musgrove	"the great - coat was hanging over the panel , and hid the arms , so it did ; otherwise , I am sure , I should have observed them , and the livery too ; if the servant had not been in mourning , one should have known him by the livery . """
Mary Musgrove	When she could command Mary 's attention , Anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not , for many years , been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable .
Mary Musgrove	She would not , upon any account , mention her having met with him the second time ; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk , but she would have felt quite ill - used by Anne 's having actually run against him in the passage , and received his very polite excuses , while she had never been near him at all ; no , that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret .
Mary Musgrove	""" Of course , "" said Mary , "" you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot , the next time you write to Bath ."
Mary Musgrove	"I think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him . "" Anne avoided a direct reply , but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated , but as what ought to be suppressed . The offence which had been given her father , many years back , she knew ; Elizabeth 's particular share in it she suspected ; and that Mr Elliot 's idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt ."
Mary Musgrove	Mary never wrote to Bath herself ; all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell on Anne .
Mary Musgrove	"she is dead ! "" screamed Mary , catching hold of her husband , and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable ; and in another moment , Henrietta , sinking under the conviction , lost her senses too , and would have fallen on the steps , but for Captain Benwick and Anne , who caught and supported her between them ."
Mary Musgrove	Anne , attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to Henrietta , still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet Mary , to animate Charles , to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth .
Mary Musgrove	Mary , too , was growing calmer . The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible .
Mary Musgrove	Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of Mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , Charles taking care of his sister , and Captain Benwick attending to her . She gave a moment 's recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . There she had listened to Henrietta 's schemes for Dr Shirley 's leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen Mr Elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa , or those who were wrapt up in her welfare . Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance .
Mary Musgrove	"In speaking of the Harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of Mrs Harville 's exertions as a nurse . "" She really left nothing for Mary to do ."
Mary Musgrove	He and Mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night . Mary had been hysterical again this morning .
Mary Musgrove	When he came away , she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good .
Mary Musgrove	He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do .
Mary Musgrove	The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ) , had brought Anne the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more . He had enquired after her , she found , particularly ; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot 's not being the worse for her exertions , and had spoken of those exertions as great . This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done . As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove 's recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter !
Mary Musgrove	Mary , often a little unwell , and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints , and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was the matter , was indisposed ; and foreseeing that she should not have a day 's health all the autumn , entreated , or rather required her , for it was hardly entreaty , to come to Uppercross Cottage , and bear her company as long as she should want her , instead of going to Bath .
Mary Musgrove	""" I can not possibly do without Anne , "" was Mary 's reasoning ; and Elizabeth 's reply was , "" Then I am sure Anne had better stay , for nobody will want her in Bath ."
Mary Musgrove	This invitation of Mary 's removed all Lady Russell 's difficulties , and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her , and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge .
Mary Musgrove	She had little hope of success ; but Elizabeth , who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself , should never , she thought ,
Mary Musgrove	She spoke , and seemed only to offend . Elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her , and indignantly answered for each party 's perfectly knowing their situation .
Mary Musgrove	""" Mrs Clay , "" said she , warmly , "" never forgets who she is ; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , I can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people ."
Mary Musgrove	And as to my father , I really should not have thought that he , who has kept himself single so long for our sakes , need be suspected now .
Mary Musgrove	If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman , I grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , I am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy .
Mary Musgrove	But poor Mrs Clay who , with all her merits , can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty , I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety .
Mary Musgrove	One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes , though I know you must fifty times .
Mary Musgrove	That tooth of her 's and those freckles . Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him .
Mary Musgrove	I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few , but he abominates them .
Mary Musgrove	""" "" I think very differently , "" answered Elizabeth , shortly ; "" an agreeable manner may set off handsome features , but can never alter plain ones ."
Mary Musgrove	However , at any rate , as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have , I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me .
Mary Musgrove	Elizabeth , though resenting the suspicion , might yet be made observant by it .
Mary Musgrove	The two families were so continually meeting , so much in the habit of running in and out of each other 's house at all hours , that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone ; but being alone , her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course .
Mary Musgrove	Though better endowed than the elder sister , Mary had not Anne 's understanding nor temper .
Mary Musgrove	"It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday . "" "" My dear Mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself !"
Mary Musgrove	I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie , trying to understand , and make him understand , which of Elizabeth 's plants are for Lady Russell .
Mary Musgrove	I have had all my own little concerns to arrange , books and music to divide , and all my trunks to repack , from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons : and one thing I have had to do , Mary , of a more trying nature : going to almost every house in the parish , as a sort of take - leave . I was told that they wished it . But all these things took up a great deal of time .
Mary Musgrove	"A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Anne 's side produced nearly a cure on Mary 's . She could soon sit upright on the sofa , and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner - time . Then , forgetting to think of it , she was at the other end of the room , beautifying a nosegay ; then , she ate her cold meat ; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk . "" Where shall we go ? "" said she , when they were ready ."
Mary Musgrove	The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough ; and she was not at all surprised at the end of it , to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves , at Mary 's particular invitation .
Charles Musgrove	Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth , nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort . She was always on friendly terms with her brother - in - law ; and in the children , who loved her nearly as well , and respected her a great deal more than their mother , she had an object of interest , amusement , and wholesome exertion . Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits . As it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else .
Charles Musgrove	He had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife 's occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne 's admiration , and
Charles Musgrove	They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money , and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father ; but here , as on most topics , he had the superiority ,
Charles Musgrove	for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made , he always contended for his father 's having many other uses for his money , and a right to spend it as he liked .
Charles Musgrove	As to the management of their children , his theory was much better than his wife 's , and his practice not so bad .
Charles Musgrove	""" I could manage them very well , if it were not for Mary 's interference , "" was what Anne often heard him say , and had a good deal of faith in ; but when listening in turn to Mary 's reproach of "" Charles spoils the children so that I can not get them into any order , "" she never had the smallest temptation to say , "" Very true . """
Charles Musgrove	"Known to have some influence with her sister , she was continually requested , or at least receiving hints to exert it , beyond what was practicable . "" I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill , "" was Charles 's language ; and , in an unhappy mood , thus spoke Mary : "" I do believe if Charles were to see me dying , he would not think there was anything the matter with me ."
Charles Musgrove	I am sure , Anne , if you would , you might persuade him that I really am very ill -- a great deal worse than I ever own .
Charles Musgrove	"She should put it off as long as she could ; "" but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on an early day , and was in a very animated , comfortable state of imaginary agitation , when she came back ."
Charles Musgrove	She wished , however to see the Crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned . They came : the master of the house was not at home , but the two sisters were together ; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne , while the Admiral sat by Mary , and made himself very agreeable by his good - humoured notice of her little boys , she was well able to watch for a likeness , and if it failed her in the features , to catch it in the voice , or in the turn of sentiment and expression . Mrs Croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person . She had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather - beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight - and - thirty . Her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour .
Charles Musgrove	"The rest was all tranquillity ; till , just as they were moving , she heard the Admiral say to Mary-- "" We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft 's here soon ; I dare say you know him by name . """
Charles Musgrove	He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys , clinging to him like an old friend , and declaring he should not go ; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets , & c. , to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun , Anne was left to persuade herself , as well as she could , that the same brother must still be in question .
Charles Musgrove	"Well now , I think we had better turn back ; I am excessively tired . "" Henrietta , conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as Mary wished ; but "" No ! "" said Charles Musgrove , and "" No , no ! "" cried Louisa more eagerly , and taking her sister aside , seemed to be arguing the matter warmly ."
Charles Musgrove	"Charles , in the meanwhile , was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt , now that he was so near ; and very evidently , though more fearfully , trying to induce his wife to go too . But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength ; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop , as she felt so tired , she resolutely answered , "" Oh ! no , indeed !"
Charles Musgrove	After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations , it was settled between Charles and his two sisters , that he and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes , to see their aunt and cousins , while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill .
Charles Musgrove	We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead .
Charles Musgrove	I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne ?
Charles Musgrove	"After a moment 's pause , Captain Wentworth said-- "" Do you mean that she refused him ? """
Charles Musgrove	""" I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary ."
Charles Musgrove	I wish she had accepted him . We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell 's doing , that she did not .
Charles Musgrove	"They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell , and that therefore , she persuaded Anne to refuse him . "" The sounds were retreating , and Anne distinguished no more ."
Charles Musgrove	Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give . Charles and Henrietta returned , bringing , as may be conjectured , Charles Hayter with them .
Charles Musgrove	She joined Charles and Mary , and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles 's other arm ; but Charles , though in very good humour with her , was out of temper with his wife .
Charles Musgrove	"Well now , I think we had better turn back ; I am excessively tired . "" Henrietta , conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as Mary wished ; but "" No ! "" said Charles Musgrove , and "" No , no ! "" cried Louisa more eagerly , and taking her sister aside , seemed to be arguing the matter warmly ."
Charles Musgrove	"Charles , in the meanwhile , was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt , now that he was so near ; and very evidently , though more fearfully , trying to induce his wife to go too . But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength ; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop , as she felt so tired , she resolutely answered , "" Oh ! no , indeed !"
Charles Musgrove	Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months ' visit there ,
Charles Musgrove	but he was gaining strength apace , and she had nothing else to stay for .
Charles Musgrove	Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself , it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross ; though November , the weather was by no means bad ; and , in short , Louisa , who was the most eager of the eager , having formed the resolution to go , and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked , being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way , bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer ; and to Lyme they were to go -- Charles , Mary , Anne , Henrietta , Louisa , and Captain Wentworth .
Charles Musgrove	The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this Mr Musgrove , for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning . They were , consequently , to stay the night there , and not to be expected back till the next day 's dinner . This was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages , Mr Musgrove 's coach containing the four ladies , and Charles 's curricle , in which he drove Captain Wentworth , were descending the long hill into Lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone . After securing accommodations , and ordering a dinner at one of the inns , the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea .
Charles Musgrove	She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House , where , as she afterwards learnt , they must inevitably have found him , when they were stopped by the eldest boy 's being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall . The child 's situation put the visit entirely aside ; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference , even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account .
Charles Musgrove	His collar - bone was found to be dislocated , and such injury received in the back , as roused the most alarming ideas .
Charles Musgrove	It was an afternoon of distress , and Anne had every thing to do at once ; the apothecary to send for , the father to have pursued and informed , the mother to support and keep from hysterics , the servants to control , the youngest child to banish , and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe ; besides sending , as soon as she recollected it , proper notice to the other house , which brought her an accession rather of frightened , enquiring companions , than of very useful assistants .
Charles Musgrove	Her brother 's return was the first comfort ; he could take best care of his wife ; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary .
Charles Musgrove	Till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar - bone was soon replaced , and though Mr Robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew 's state , as to give the information of Captain Wentworth 's visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before .
Charles Musgrove	that the cottage party , probably , would not like to leave the little boy , to give him the meeting .
Charles Musgrove	""" Oh no ; as to leaving the little boy , "" both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought ; and Anne , in the joy of the escape , could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs ."
Charles Musgrove	"Charles Musgrove , indeed , afterwards , shewed more of inclination ; "" the child was going on so well , and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth , that , perhaps , he might join them in the evening ; he would not dine from home , but he might walk in for half an hour . "" But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife , with "" Oh !"
Charles Musgrove	no , indeed , Charles , I can not bear to have you go away .
Charles Musgrove	The child had a good night , and was going on well the next day .
Charles Musgrove	The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible ; but what was there for a father to do ?
Charles Musgrove	His father very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth , and there being no sufficient reason against it , he ought to go ; and it ended in his making a bold , public declaration , when he came in from shooting , of his meaning to dress directly , and dine at the other house .
Charles Musgrove	""" Nothing can be going on better than the child , "" said he ; "" so I told my father , just now , that I would come , and he thought me quite right ."
Charles Musgrove	Your sister being with you , my love , I have no scruple at all .
Charles Musgrove	You would not like to leave him yourself , but you see I can be of no use .
Charles Musgrove	"Anne will send for me if anything is the matter . "" Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain . Mary knew , from Charles 's manner of speaking , that he was quite determined on going , and that it would be of no use to teaze him ."
Charles Musgrove	"She said nothing , therefore , till he was out of the room , but as soon as there was only Anne to hear-- "" So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves , with this poor sick child ; and not a creature coming near us all the evening !"
Charles Musgrove	I knew how it would be .
Charles Musgrove	This is always my luck .
Charles Musgrove	If there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it , and Charles is as bad as any of them .
Charles Musgrove	I must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy .
Charles Musgrove	Talks of his being going on so well !
Charles Musgrove	How does he know that he is going on well , or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence ? I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling .
Charles Musgrove	So here he is to go away and enjoy himself , and because I am the poor mother , I am not to be allowed to stir ; and yet , I am sure , I am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child .
Charles Musgrove	My being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried .
Charles Musgrove	I am not at all equal to it .
Charles Musgrove	"You saw how hysterical I was yesterday . "" "" But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm-- of the shock ."
Charles Musgrove	I dare say we shall have nothing to distress us .
Charles Musgrove	I perfectly understand Mr Robinson 's directions , and have no fears ; and indeed , Mary , I can not wonder at your husband .
Charles Musgrove	I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother , but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick - room than Charles , for I can not be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if I told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about .
Charles Musgrove	I have not nerves for the sort of thing .
Charles Musgrove	""" "" But , could you be comfortable yourself , to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy ? "" """
Charles Musgrove	Yes ; you see his papa can , and why should not I ?
Charles Musgrove	Jemima is so careful ; and she could send us word every hour how he was . I really think Charles might as well have told his father we would all come .
Charles Musgrove	"I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is . I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday , but the case is very different to - day . "" "" Well , if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself , suppose you were to go , as well as your husband . Leave little Charles to my care ."
Charles Musgrove	"Mr and Mrs Musgrove can not think it wrong while I remain with him . "" "" Are you serious ? "" cried Mary , her eyes brightening ."
Charles Musgrove	To be sure , I may just as well go as not , for I am of no use at home -- am I ?
Charles Musgrove	and it only harasses me .
Charles Musgrove	You can make little Charles do anything ; he always minds you at a word .
Charles Musgrove	It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima . Oh !
Charles Musgrove	I shall certainly go ; I am sure I ought if I can , quite as much as Charles , for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth , and I know you do not mind being left alone .
Charles Musgrove	I will go and tell Charles , and get ready directly .
Charles Musgrove	You can send for us , you know , at a moment 's notice , if anything is the matter ; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you .
Charles Musgrove	"I should not go , you may be sure , if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child . "" The next moment she was tapping at her husband 's dressing - room door , and as Anne followed her up stairs , she was in time for the whole conversation , which began with Mary 's saying , in a tone of great exultation-- "" I mean to go with you , Charles , for I am of no more use at home than you are ."
Charles Musgrove	If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child , I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like .
Charles Musgrove	Anne will stay ; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him .
Charles Musgrove	It is Anne 's own proposal , and so I shall go with you , which will be a great deal better , for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday .
Charles Musgrove	""" "" This is very kind of Anne , "" was her husband 's answer , "" and I should be very glad to have you go ; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself , to nurse our sick child . """
Charles Musgrove	Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause , and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him , where conviction was at least very agreeable , he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone , though he still wanted her to join them in the evening , when the child might be at rest for the night , and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her , but she was quite unpersuadable ; and this being the case , she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits . They were gone , she hoped , to be happy , however oddly constructed such happiness might seem ; as for herself , she was left with as many sensations of comfort , as were , perhaps , ever likely to be hers . She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child ; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant , making himself agreeable to others ?
Charles Musgrove	There had been music , singing , talking , laughing , all that was most agreeable ; charming manners in Captain Wentworth , no shyness or reserve ; they seemed all to know each other perfectly , and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with Charles .
Charles Musgrove	He was to come to breakfast , but not at the Cottage , though that had been proposed at first ; but then he had been pressed to come to the Great House instead , and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs Charles Musgrove 's way , on account of the child , and therefore , somehow , they hardly knew how , it ended in Charles 's being to meet him to breakfast at his father 's .
Charles Musgrove	The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child 's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice . Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over .
Charles Musgrove	In two minutes after Charles 's preparation , the others appeared ; they were in the drawing - room .
Charles Musgrove	"Charles shewed himself at the window , all was ready , their visitor had bowed and was gone , the Miss Musgroves were gone too , suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen : the room was cleared , and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could . "" It is over !"
Charles Musgrove	14 Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge . They had left Louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them . They had been all in lodgings together .
Charles Musgrove	Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme . She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight . Anne enquired after Captain Benwick , Mary 's face was clouded directly . Charles laughed .
Charles Musgrove	Captain Benwick is very well , I believe , but he is a very odd young man .
Charles Musgrove	I do not know what he would be at .
Charles Musgrove	: Charles undertook to give him some shooting , and he seemed quite delighted , and , for my part , I thought it was all settled ; when behold ! on Tuesday night , he made a very awkward sort of excuse ; ` he never shot ' and he had ` been quite misunderstood , ' and he had promised this and he had promised that , and the end of it was , I found , that he did not mean to come .
Charles Musgrove	"Charles laughed again and said , "" Now Mary , you know very well how it really was ."
Charles Musgrove	and he had not courage to come . That is the fact , upon my honour , Mary knows it is .
Charles Musgrove	"he talks of you , "" cried Charles , "" in such terms-- "" Mary interrupted him ."
Charles Musgrove	""" I declare , Charles , I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there ."
Charles Musgrove	"I declare , Anne , he never talks of you at all . "" "" No , "" admitted Charles , "" I do not know that he ever does , in a general way ; but however , it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly ."
Charles Musgrove	I can not pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine -- I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it ; and then ` Miss Elliot ' was spoken of in the highest terms !
Charles Musgrove	Now Mary , I declare it was so , I heard it myself , and you were in the other room .
Charles Musgrove	""" I must see Captain Benwick before I decide , "" said Lady Russell , smiling . "" And that you are very likely to do very soon , I can tell you , ma'am , """
Charles Musgrove	said Charles .
Charles Musgrove	I told him the distance and the road , and I told him of the church 's being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , I thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon .
Charles Musgrove	So , I give you notice , Lady Russell .
Charles Musgrove	""" "" Well , as your joint acquaintance , then , I shall be very happy to see Captain Benwick . "" "" You will not find anything very agreeable in him , I assure you , ma'am ."
Charles Musgrove	He has walked with me , sometimes , from one end of the sands to the other , without saying a word . He is not at all a well - bred young man .
Charles Musgrove	I am sure you will not like him .
Charles Musgrove	""" "" So do I , Anne , "" said Charles ."
Charles Musgrove	""" I am sure Lady Russell would like him ."
Charles Musgrove	He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week , and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him ; but , as Charles maintained to the last , Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch . There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick , from this time . Lady Russell could not hear the door - bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father 's grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him . Captain Benwick came not , however .
Charles Musgrove	He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined , or he was too shy ; and after giving him a week 's indulgence , Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite . The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school , bringing with them Mrs Harville 's little children , to improve the noise of Uppercross , and lessen that of Lyme .
Charles Musgrove	Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them . On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others . Charles and Mary also came in , of course , during their visit , and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell , and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain .
Charles Musgrove	They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove , and were at the White Hart . So much was pretty soon understood ; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing - room , and regaling themselves with her admiration , Anne could not draw upon Charles 's brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary , as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of .
Charles Musgrove	He had begun to talk of it a week ago ; and by way of doing something , as shooting was over , Charles had proposed coming with him , and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it
Charles Musgrove	Anne 's only surprise was , that affairs should be in forwardness enough for Henrietta 's wedding - clothes to be talked of . She had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand ; but she learned from Charles that , very recently , ( since Mary 's last letter to herself ) , Charles Hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years ; and that on the strength of his present income , with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question , the two families had consented to the young people 's wishes , and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months , quite as soon as Louisa 's .
Charles Musgrove	""" And a very good living it was , "" Charles added : "" only five - and - twenty miles from Uppercross , and in a very fine country : fine part of Dorsetshire"
Charles Musgrove	In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom , surrounded by three great proprietors , each more careful and jealous than the other ; and to two of the three at least , Charles Hayter might get a special recommendation .
Charles Musgrove	"Not that he will value it as he ought , "" he observed , "" Charles is too cool about sporting ."
Charles Musgrove	"That 's the worst of him . """
Charles Musgrove	"I can not make her attend to the value of the property . It is a very fair match , as times go ; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life , and I shall not leave off now . "" "" Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove , "" exclaimed Anne , "" should be happy in their children 's marriages . They do everything to confer happiness , I am sure ."
Charles Musgrove	Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles 's following the others to admire mirrors and china ; but Anne had heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross , and rejoice in its happiness ; and though she sighed as she rejoiced , her sigh had none of the ill - will of envy in it .
Charles Musgrove	Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning ; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary , to go and see her and Henrietta directly . Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present .
Charles Musgrove	It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on Charles 's leaving them together , was listening to Mrs Musgrove 's history of Louisa , and to Henrietta 's of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which Mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill - used by anybody ; which Mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining .
Charles Musgrove	A large party in an hotel ensured a quick - changing , unsettled scene . One five minutes brought a note , the next a parcel ; and Anne had not been there half an hour , when their dining - room , spacious as it was , seemed more than half filled : a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove , and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth .
Charles Musgrove	"The visitors took their leave ; and Charles , having civilly seen them off , and then made a face at them , and abused them for coming , began with-- "" Well , mother , I have done something for you that you will like ."
Charles Musgrove	I have been to the theatre , and secured a box for to - morrow night .
Charles Musgrove	A'n't I a good boy ?
Charles Musgrove	I know you love a play ; and there is room for us all .
Charles Musgrove	It holds nine . I have engaged Captain Wentworth .
Charles Musgrove	Anne will not be sorry to join us , I am sure .
Charles Musgrove	"Have not I done well , mother ? """
Charles Musgrove	"Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play , if Henrietta and all the others liked it , when Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming-- "" Good heavens , Charles ! how can you think of such a thing ?"
Charles Musgrove	Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to - morrow night ? and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter , and Mr Elliot , and all the principal family connexions , on purpose to be introduced to them ?
Charles Musgrove	"How can you be so forgetful ? "" "" Phoo ! phoo ! "" replied Charles , "" what 's an evening party ?"
Charles Musgrove	Your father might have asked us to dinner , I think , if he had wanted to see us .
Charles Musgrove	You may do as you like , but I shall go to the play .
Charles Musgrove	Charles , I declare it will be too abominable if you do , when you promised to go .
Charles Musgrove	""" No , I did not promise ."
Charles Musgrove	I only smirked and bowed , and said the word ` happy . '
Charles Musgrove	"There was no promise . "" "" But you must go , Charles ."
Charles Musgrove	""" "" Do n't talk to me about heirs and representatives , "" cried Charles ."
Charles Musgrove	""" I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun . If I would not go for the sake of your father , I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir ."
Charles Musgrove	"What is Mr Elliot to me ? """
Charles Musgrove	The careless expression was life to Anne , who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention , looking and listening with his whole soul ; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself . Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style ; he , half serious and half jesting , maintaining the scheme for the play , and she , invariably serious , most warmly opposing it , and not omitting to make it known that , however determined to go to Camden Place herself , she should not think herself very well used , if they went to the play without her . Mrs Musgrove interposed .
Charles Musgrove	Charles , you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday .
Charles Musgrove	It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day ; Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife , by persisting that he would go to the play to - morrow if nobody else would .
Charles Musgrove	Charles heard it quite by chance ; they have not had the civility to give me any notice , or of offering to take anything . I do not think they improve at all as neighbours . We see nothing of them , and this is really an instance of gross inattention .
Charles Musgrove	Charles joins me in love , and everything proper .
Charles Musgrove	Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say ; but if you remember , I never thought him attached to Louisa ; I never could see anything of it .
Charles Musgrove	How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me . I hope he will be more agreeable now .
Charles Musgrove	Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel ! Perhaps he had quitted the field , had given Louisa up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her .
Charles Musgrove	And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation , Charles , Mary , and Henrietta all came in .
Charles Musgrove	Charles , ring and order a chair . She must not walk .
Charles Musgrove	Charles , if you see Captain Harville anywhere , remember to give Miss Anne 's message .
Charles Musgrove	Charles , in his real concern and good nature , would go home with her ; there was no preventing him .
Charles Musgrove	But she could not be long ungrateful ; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith 's , to be of use to her ; and she set off with him , with no feeling but gratitude apparent .
Charles Musgrove	"Presently , struck by a sudden thought , Charles said-- "" Captain Wentworth , which way are you going ?"
Charles Musgrove	There could be only the most proper alacrity , a most obliging compliance for public view ; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture . In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again , and the other two proceeding together : and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk , where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed , and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow . There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything , but which had been followed by so many , many years of division and estrangement .
Charles Musgrove	"Charles , my dear , "" ( beckoning him to her ) , "" do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother ."
Charles Musgrove	""" "" It was at Gibraltar , mother , I know ."
Charles Musgrove	"but , Charles , tell Captain Wentworth , he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me , for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend . """
Charles Musgrove	Charles , being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case , only nodded in reply , and walked away .
Charles Musgrove	The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own ; the servant in mourning roused Anne 's curiosity , and the whole six were collected to look , by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household , and taking his seat , to drive off .
Charles Musgrove	"Many had looked on each other , and many had repeated the name , before all this had been got through , even by the smart rapidity of a waiter . "" Bless me ! "" cried Mary ; "" it must be our cousin ; it must be our Mr Elliot , it must , indeed ! Charles , Anne , must not it ? In mourning , you see , just as our Mr Elliot must be ."
Charles Musgrove	""" Captain Benwick obeyed , and Charles at the same moment , disengaging himself from his wife , they were both with him ; and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them , and everything was done that Anne had prompted , but in vain ;"
Charles Musgrove	As to the wretched party left behind , it could scarcely be said which of the three , who were completely rational , was suffering most : Captain Wentworth , Anne , or Charles , who , really a very affectionate brother , hung over Louisa with sobs of grief , and could only turn his eyes from one sister , to see the other in a state as insensible , or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife , calling on him
Charles Musgrove	for help which he could not give
Charles Musgrove	Anne , attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to Henrietta , still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet Mary , to animate Charles , to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth .
Charles Musgrove	""" Anne , Anne , "" cried Charles , "" What is to be done next ?"
Charles Musgrove	To some of the best - looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned , for , though partially revived , she was quite helpless ; and in this manner , Anne walking by her side , and Charles attending to his wife , they set forward , treading back with feelings unutterable , the ground , which so lately , so very lately , and so light of heart , they had passed along .
Charles Musgrove	Charles , Henrietta , and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation , and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror .
Charles Musgrove	"Musgrove , either you or I must go . """
Charles Musgrove	Charles agreed , but declared his resolution of not going away . He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would .
Charles Musgrove	And to go home without Charles , too , without her husband !
Charles Musgrove	Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of Mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , Charles taking care of his sister , and Captain Benwick attending to her . She gave a moment 's recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . There she had listened to Henrietta 's schemes for Dr Shirley 's leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen Mr Elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa , or those who were wrapt up in her welfare . Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance .
Charles Musgrove	Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them , and a chaise and four in waiting , stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street ; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other , the change in his countenance , the astonishment , the expressions begun and suppressed , with which Charles was listened to , made but a mortifying reception of Anne ; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa .
Charles Musgrove	Charles came a few hours afterwards , to bring a later and more particular account .
Charles Musgrove	He was tolerably cheerful .
Charles Musgrove	"In speaking of the Harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of Mrs Harville 's exertions as a nurse . "" She really left nothing for Mary to do ."
Charles Musgrove	He and Mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night . Mary had been hysterical again this morning .
Charles Musgrove	When he came away , she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good .
Charles Musgrove	He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do .
Charles Musgrove	""" Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon , and his father had at first half a mind to go with him , but the ladies could not consent ."
Charles Musgrove	A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne , and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery - maid of the family , one who having brought up all the children , and seen the very last , the lingering and long - petted Master Harry , sent to school after his brothers , was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her , and who , consequently , was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa . Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither , had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta ; but without Anne , it would hardly have been resolved on , and found practicable so soon .
Charles Musgrove	With a great deal of quiet observation , and a knowledge , which she often wished less , of her father 's character , she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible . She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind .
Charles Musgrove	Mrs Clay had freckles , and a projecting tooth , and a clumsy wrist , which he was continually making severe remarks upon , in her absence ; but she was young , and certainly altogether well - looking , and possessed , in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners , infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been .
Charles Musgrove	And as to my father , I really should not have thought that he , who has kept himself single so long for our sakes , need be suspected now .
Charles Musgrove	If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman , I grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , I am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy .
Charles Musgrove	One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes , though I know you must fifty times .
Charles Musgrove	That tooth of her 's and those freckles . Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him .
Charles Musgrove	I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few , but he abominates them .
Charles Musgrove	You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay 's freckles .
Charles Musgrove	"I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer . "" Anne said what was proper , and enquired after her husband ."
Charles Musgrove	Charles is out shooting .
Charles Musgrove	I have not seen him since seven o'clock .
Charles Musgrove	He would go , though I told him how ill I was .
Charles Musgrove	He said he should not stay out long ; but he has never come back , and now it is almost one .
Charles Musgrove	I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father 's books and pictures .
Charles Musgrove	The father and mother were in the old English style , and the young people in the new .
Charles Musgrove	Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a very good sort of people ; friendly and hospitable , not much educated , and not at all elegant .
Charles Musgrove	Their children had more modern minds and manners . There was a numerous family ; but the only two grown up , excepting Charles , were Henrietta and Louisa , young ladies of nineteen and twenty , who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments , and were now like thousands of other young ladies , living to be fashionable , happy , and merry . Their dress had every advantage , their faces were rather pretty , their spirits extremely good , their manner unembarrassed and pleasant ; they were of consequence at home , and favourites abroad .
Lady Russell	""" She could only resolve to avoid such self - delusion in future , and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell . The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard , and to destroy , their own horses , dogs , and newspapers to engage them , and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping , neighbours , dress , dancing , and music . She acknowledged it to be very fitting , that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse ; and hoped , ere long , to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into ."
Lady Russell	Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth , nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort . She was always on friendly terms with her brother - in - law ; and in the children , who loved her nearly as well , and respected her a great deal more than their mother , she had an object of interest , amusement , and wholesome exertion . Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits . As it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else .
Lady Russell	I wish she had accepted him . We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell 's doing , that she did not .
Lady Russell	"They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell , and that therefore , she persuaded Anne to refuse him . "" The sounds were retreating , and Anne distinguished no more ."
Lady Russell	The time now approached for Lady Russell 's return
Lady Russell	: the day was even fixed ; and Anne , being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled , was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch , and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it .
Lady Russell	This was against her ; but on the other hand , he spent so much of his time at Uppercross , that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind , than as going towards him ; and , upon the whole , she believed she must , on this interesting question , be the gainer , almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society , in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell
Lady Russell	She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall : those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her ; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere .
Lady Russell	They did not like each other , and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good ; and were Lady Russell to see them together , she might think that he had too much self - possession , and she too little . These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross , where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough .
Lady Russell	16 There was one point which Anne , on returning to her family , would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot 's being in love with Elizabeth , which was , her father 's not being in love with Mrs Clay ; and she was very far from easy about it , when she had been at home a few hours .
Lady Russell	"She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said , that "" now Miss Anne was come , she could not suppose herself at all wanted ; "" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper , "" That must not be any reason , indeed ."
Lady Russell	I assure you I feel it none .
Lady Russell	"She is nothing to me , compared with you ; "" and she was in full time to hear her father say , "" My dear madam , this must not be ."
Lady Russell	As yet , you have seen nothing of Bath .
Lady Russell	You have been here only to be useful .
Lady Russell	You must not run away from us now .
Lady Russell	You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis , the beautiful Mrs Wallis .
Lady Russell	"To your fine mind , I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification . """
Lady Russell	He spoke and looked so much in earnest , that Anne was not surprised to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself .
Lady Russell	"You see how it has carried away her freckles . "" If Elizabeth could but have heard this ! Such personal praise might have struck her , especially as it did not appear to Anne that the freckles were at all lessened . But everything must take its chance ."
Lady Russell	The evil of a marriage would be much diminished , if Elizabeth were also to marry . As for herself , she might always command a home with Lady Russell .
Lady Russell	Lady Russell 's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point , in her intercourse in Camden Place .
Lady Russell	The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour , and of Anne so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in Bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed .
Lady Russell	"As Mr Elliot became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others . His manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told Anne , almost ready to exclaim , "" Can this be Mr Elliot ? "" and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man ."
Lady Russell	She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage .
Lady Russell	Colonel Wallis said it , and Lady Russell saw it ; but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind , nor ( she began pretty soon to suspect ) to prevent his thinking of a second choice .
Lady Russell	Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay .
Lady Russell	It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently ; and it did not surprise her , therefore , that Lady Russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent , nothing to require more motives than appeared , in Mr Elliot 's great desire of a reconciliation . In Lady Russell 's view , it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot , at a mature time of life , should feel it a most desirable object , and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people , to be on good terms with the head of his family ; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear , and only erring in the heyday of youth .
Lady Russell	"Anne presumed , however , still to smile about it , and at last to mention "" Elizabeth . """
Lady Russell	"Lady Russell listened , and looked , and made only this cautious reply:--""Elizabeth ! very well ; time will explain . "" It was a reference to the future , which Anne , after a little observation , felt she must submit to ."
Lady Russell	"In that house Elizabeth must be first ; and she was in the habit of such general observance as "" Miss Elliot , "" that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible ."
Lady Russell	How to have this anxious business set to rights , and be admitted as cousins again , was the question : and it was a question which , in a more rational manner , neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot thought unimportant .
Lady Russell	""" Family connexions were always worth preserving , good company always worth seeking ; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house , for three months , in Laura Place , and would be living in style . She had been at Bath the year before , and Lady Russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman ."
Lady Russell	Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could admire the letter ; but it did all that was wanted , in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess .
Lady Russell	"Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better ; but yet "" it was an acquaintance worth having ; """
Lady Russell	Upon Lady Russell 's appearance soon afterwards , the whole party was collected , and all that remained was to marshal themselves , and proceed into the Concert Room ; and be of all the consequence in their power , draw as many eyes , excite as many whispers , and disturb as many people as they could . Very , very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in . Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret , and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her , had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach ; and Anne -- but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne 's felicity , to draw any comparison between it and her sister 's ; the origin of one all selfish vanity , of the other all generous attachment . Anne saw nothing , thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room .
Lady Russell	She remained in her seat , and so did Lady Russell ; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot ; and she did not mean , whatever she might feel on Lady Russell 's account , to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth , if he gave her the opportunity .
Lady Russell	She was persuaded by Lady Russell 's countenance that she had seen him . He did not come however .
Lady Russell	She thought of her father , of Lady Russell . Could there have been any unpleasant glances ?
Lady Russell	1 Sir Walter Elliot , of Kellynch Hall , in Somersetshire , was a man who , for his own amusement , never took up any book but the Baronetage ; there he found occupation for an idle hour , and consolation in a distressed one ; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect , by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents ; there any unwelcome sensations , arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century ; and there , if every other leaf were powerless , he could read his own history with an interest which never failed .
Lady Russell	"This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened : "" ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL . """
Lady Russell	Walter Elliot , born March 1 , 1760 , married , July 15 , 1784 , Elizabeth , daughter of James Stevenson , Esq . of South Park , in the county of Gloucester , by which lady ( who died 1800 ) he has issue Elizabeth , born June 1 , 1785 ; Anne , born August 9 , 1787 ; a still - born son , November 5 , 1789 ; Mary , born November 20 , 1791 .
Lady Russell	""" Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer 's hands ; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding , for the information of himself and his family , these words , after the date of Mary 's birth-- "" Married , December 16 , 1810 , Charles , son and heir of Charles Musgrove , Esq . of Uppercross , in the county of Somerset , "" and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife"
Lady Russell	"Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in Cheshire ; how mentioned in Dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of Charles II , with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto:--""Principal seat , Kellynch Hall , in the county of Somerset , "" and Sir Walter 's handwriting again in this finale:-- "" Heir presumptive , William Walter Elliot , Esq . , great grandson of the second Sir Walter . """
Lady Russell	He had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty - four , was still a very fine man .
Lady Russell	Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did , nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society . He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy ; and the Sir Walter Elliot , who united these gifts , was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion
Lady Russell	Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman , sensible and amiable ; whose judgement and conduct , if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot , had never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured , or softened , or concealed his failings , and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years ; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself , had found enough in her duties , her friends , and her children , to attach her to life , and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them .
Lady Russell	--Three girls , the two eldest sixteen and fourteen , was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath , an awful charge rather , to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited , silly father . She had , however , one very intimate friend , a sensible , deserving woman , who had been brought , by strong attachment to herself , to settle close by her , in the village of Kellynch ; and on her kindness and advice , Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters .
Lady Russell	This friend , and Sir Walter , did not marry , whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance . Thirteen years
Lady Russell	That Lady Russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again , than when she does not ; but Sir Walter 's continuing in singleness requires explanation .
Lady Russell	her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ) , there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem .
Lady Russell	It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty - nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost . It was so with Elizabeth , still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and Sir Walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing .
Lady Russell	Anne haggard , Mary coarse , every face in the neighbourhood worsting , and the rapid increase of the crow 's foot about Lady Russell 's temples had long been a distress to him .
Lady Russell	Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall , presiding and directing with a self - possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was . For thirteen years had she been doing the honours , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing - rooms and dining - rooms in the country .
Lady Russell	Thirteen winters ' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded , and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms , as she travelled up to London with her father , for a few weeks ' annual enjoyment of the great world . She had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine - and - twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions ; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever , but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet - blood within the next twelvemonth or two . Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth , but now she liked it not .
Lady Russell	She had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should . He had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after Lady Elliot 's death , Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing - back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to London , when Elizabeth was in her first bloom , Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction .
Lady Russell	He was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed .
Lady Russell	He was invited to Kellynch Hall ; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year ; but he never came .
Lady Russell	The following spring he was seen again in town , found equally agreeable , again encouraged , invited , and expected , and again he did not come ; and the next tidings were that he was married . Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot , he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth .
Lady Russell	"As the head of the house , he felt that he ought to have been consulted , especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand ; "" For they must have been seen together , "" he observed , "" once at Tattersall 's , and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons . """
Lady Russell	Mr Elliot had attempted no apology , and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family , as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it : all acquaintance between them had ceased .
Lady Russell	This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still , after an interval of several years , felt with anger by Elizabeth , who had liked the man for himself , and still more for being her father 's heir , and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot 's eldest daughter . There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal .
Lady Russell	"Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench ? "" and Elizabeth , to do her justice , had , in the first ardour of female alarm , set seriously to think what could be done , and had finally proposed these two branches of economy , to cut off some unnecessary charities , and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing - room ; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne , as had been the usual yearly custom . But these measures , however good in themselves , were insufficient for the real extent of the evil , the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards ."
Lady Russell	""" But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance ? "" asked Elizabeth ."
Lady Russell	""" Sir Henry Russell 's widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot . A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings ! A poor widow barely able to live , between thirty and forty ; a mere Mrs Smith , an every - day Mrs Smith , of all people and all names in the world , to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot , and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland ! Mrs Smith !"
Lady Russell	She had been the only one of the set absent , for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship 's service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot ; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early , and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her . Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell .
Lady Russell	Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot . He thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence . He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits ; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend , could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man , without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create . Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot .
Lady Russell	She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her , and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood , and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing .
Lady Russell	She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject , she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter , of a possible attachment on his side , of the desirableness of the alliance , supposing such attachment to be real and returned .
Lady Russell	"Anne heard her , and made no violent exclamations ; she only smiled , blushed , and gently shook her head . "" I am no match - maker , as you well know , "" said Lady Russell , "" being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations ."
Lady Russell	I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together .
Lady Russell	"A most suitable connection everybody must consider it , but I think it might be a very happy one . """
Lady Russell	"Lady Russell let this pass , and only said in rejoinder , "" I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother 's place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me . You are your mother 's self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued ! My dearest Anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! """
Lady Russell	"The idea of becoming what her mother had been ; of having the precious name of "" Lady Elliot "" first revived in herself ; of being restored to Kellynch , calling it her home again , her home for ever , was a charm which she could not immediately resist . Lady Russell said not another word , willing to leave the matter to its own operation ; and believing that , could Mr Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed , in short , what Anne did not believe ."
Lady Russell	He had spoken to her with some degree of openness of Mrs Clay ; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was about , and to hold her in contempt ; and yet Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body . Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend , for she saw nothing to excite distrust . She could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot ; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church , in the course of the following autumn .
Lady Russell	Mr Shepherd , a civil , cautious lawyer , who , whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter , would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else , excused himself from offering the slightest hint , and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell , from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted .
Lady Russell	Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject , and gave it much serious consideration . She was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities , whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great , from the opposition of two leading principles .
Lady Russell	She was of strict integrity herself , with a delicate sense of honour ; but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter 's feelings , as solicitous for the credit of the family , as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them , as anybody of sense and honesty could well be . She was a benevolent , charitable , good woman , and capable of strong attachments , most correct in her conduct , strict in her notions of decorum , and with manners that were held a standard of good - breeding .
Lady Russell	She had a cultivated mind , and was , generally speaking , rational and consistent ; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry ; she had a value for rank and consequence , which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them . Herself the widow of only a knight , she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due ; and Sir Walter , independent of his claims as an old acquaintance , an attentive neighbour , an obliging landlord , the husband of her very dear friend , the father of Anne and her sisters , was , as being Sir Walter , in her apprehension , entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties . They must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt .
Lady Russell	But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth .
Lady Russell	She drew up plans of economy , she made exact calculations , and
Lady Russell	she did what nobody else thought of doing : she consulted Anne , who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question .
Lady Russell	She consulted , and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter .
Lady Russell	She wanted more vigorous measures , a more complete reformation , a quicker release from debt , a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity .
Lady Russell	""" If we can persuade your father to all this , "" said Lady Russell , looking over her paper , "" much may be done ."
Lady Russell	If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth , that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which can not be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle .
Lady Russell	"What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ? There will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct . I have great hope of prevailing . We must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man . "" This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him . She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure , and saw no dignity in anything short of it . She wanted it to be prescribed , and felt as a duty . She rated Lady Russell 's influence highly ; and as to the severe degree of self - denial which her own conscience prompted , she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete , than to half a reformation ."
Lady Russell	Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both , and so on , through the whole list of Lady Russell 's too gentle reductions .
Lady Russell	Lady Russell 's had no success at all : could not be put up with , were not to be borne .
Lady Russell	All Anne 's wishes had been for the latter . A small house in their own neighbourhood , where they might still have Lady Russell 's society , still be near Mary , and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch , was the object of her ambition . But the usual fate of Anne attended her , in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on . She disliked Bath , and did not think it agreed with her ; and Bath was to be her home .
Lady Russell	Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from Kellynch , only fifty miles , and Lady Russell 's spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell , whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there .
Lady Russell	Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne 's known wishes .
Lady Russell	And with regard to Anne 's dislike of Bath , she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising , first , from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there , after her mother 's death ; and secondly , from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself . Lady Russell was fond of Bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend 's health , by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good .
Lady Russell	A larger society would improve them . She wanted her to be more known .
Lady Russell	Lady Russell had another excellent one at hand , for being extremely glad that Sir Walter and his family were to remove from the country .
Lady Russell	Elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy , which she wished to see interrupted .
Lady Russell	It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd , who had returned , after an unprosperous marriage , to her father 's house , with the additional burden of two children . She was a clever young woman , who understood the art of pleasing -- the art of pleasing , at least , at Kellynch Hall ; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot , as to have been already staying there more than once , in spite of all that Lady Russell , who thought it a friendship quite out of place , could hint of caution and reserve .
Lady Russell	Lady Russell , indeed , had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth , and seemed to love her , rather because she would love her , than because Elizabeth deserved it .
Lady Russell	She had never received from her more than outward attention , nothing beyond the observances of complaisance ; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry , against previous inclination . She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : Elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility .
Lady Russell	From situation , Mrs Clay was , in Lady Russell 's estimate , a very unequal , and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion ; and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind , and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot 's reach , was therefore an object of first - rate importance .
Lady Russell	Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay .
Lady Russell	It began to rain , not much , but enough to make shelter desirable for women , and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple 's carriage , which was seen waiting at a little distance ; she , Anne , and Mrs Clay , therefore , turned into Molland 's , while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple , to request her assistance .
Lady Russell	But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay ; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all , and her boots were so thick !
Lady Russell	much thicker than Miss Anne 's ; and , in short , her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be , and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined , that the others were obliged to settle it for them ; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already , and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal ,
Lady Russell	It was fixed accordingly , that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the carriage ; and they had just reached this point , when Anne , as she sat near the window , descried , most decidedly and distinctly , Captain Wentworth walking down the street .
Lady Russell	For a few minutes she saw nothing before her ; it was all confusion . She was lost , and when she had scolded back her senses , she found the others still waiting for the carriage , and Mr Elliot ( always obliging ) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs Clay 's . She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door ; she wanted to see if it rained .
Lady Russell	She had never found it so difficult to listen to him , though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care , and though his subjects were principally such as were wo nt to be always interesting : praise , warm , just , and discriminating , of Lady Russell , and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay .
Lady Russell	In that case , so liable as every body was to meet every body in Bath , Lady Russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere .
Lady Russell	Would she recollect him ?
Lady Russell	How would it all be ? She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick .
Lady Russell	It had cost her something to encounter Lady Russell 's surprise ; and now , if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth , her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him .
Lady Russell	She looked instinctively at Lady Russell ; but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself .
Lady Russell	No , it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite . She looked at her however , from time to time , anxiously ; and when the moment approached which must point him out , though not daring to look again ( for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen ) , she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell 's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him-- of her being , in short , intently observing him .
Lady Russell	She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell 's mind , the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes , the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him , and in foreign climes and in active service too , without robbing him of one personal grace ! At last , Lady Russell drew back her head .
Lady Russell	""" You will wonder , "" said she , "" what has been fixing my eye so long ; but I was looking after some window - curtains , which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night ."
Lady Russell	"They described the drawing - room window - curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way , and this part of the street , as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath , but could not recollect the exact number , and I have been trying to find out which it could be ; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description . """
Lady Russell	Elizabeth had turned from him , Lady Russell overlooked him ; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances ; she felt that she owed him attention .
Lady Russell	She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her ; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off , with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow .
Lady Russell	"It was in one of these short meetings , each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants , that she said-- "" I have been thinking over the past , and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong , I mean with regard to myself ; and I must believe that I was right , much as I suffered from it , that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now ."
Lady Russell	To me , she was in the place of a parent .
Lady Russell	I am not saying that she did not err in her advice . It was , perhaps , one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides ; and for myself , I certainly never should , in any circumstance of tolerable similarity , give such advice .
Lady Russell	"But I mean , that I was right in submitting to her , and that if I had done otherwise , I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up , because I should have suffered in my conscience . I have now , as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature , nothing to reproach myself with ; and if I mistake not , a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman 's portion . "" He looked at her , looked at Lady Russell , and looking again at her , replied , as if in cool deliberation-- "" Not yet . But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time ."
Lady Russell	I trust to being in charity with her soon .
Lady Russell	But I too have been thinking over the past , and a question has suggested itself , whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady ?
Lady Russell	The only one among them , whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was Lady Russell .
Lady Russell	Anne knew that Lady Russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot , and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with , and do justice to Captain Wentworth .
Lady Russell	This however was what Lady Russell had now to do . She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both ; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each ; that because Captain Wentworth 's manners had not suited her own ideas , she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity ; and that because Mr Elliot 's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness , their general politeness and suavity , she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well - regulated mind .
Lady Russell	There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do , than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong , and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes . There is a quickness of perception in some , a nicety in the discernment of character , a natural penetration , in short , which no experience in others can equal , and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend .
Lady Russell	But she was a very good woman , and if her second object was to be sensible and well - judging , her first was to see Anne happy . She loved Anne better than she loved her own abilities ; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over , found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child .
Lady Russell	It was creditable to have a sister married , and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion , by keeping Anne with her in the autumn ; and as her own sister must be better than her husband 's sisters , it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter .
Lady Russell	She had something to suffer , perhaps , when they came into contact again , in seeing Anne restored to the rights of seniority , and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette ; but she had a future to look forward to , of powerful consolation .
Lady Russell	Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her , no landed estate , no headship of a family ; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet , she would not change situations with Anne .
Lady Russell	He soon quitted Bath ; and on Mrs Clay 's quitting it soon afterwards , and being next heard of as established under his protection in London , it was evident how double a game he had been playing , and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman , at least .
Lady Russell	Mrs Clay 's affections had overpowered her interest , and she had sacrificed , for the young man 's sake , the possibility of scheming longer for Sir Walter .
Lady Russell	She has abilities , however , as well as affections ; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning , or hers , may finally carry the day ; whether , after preventing her from being the wife of Sir Walter , he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William . It can not be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion , and the discovery of their deception in her . They had their great cousins , to be sure , to resort to for comfort ; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others , without being flattered and followed in turn , is but a state of half enjoyment .
Lady Russell	Anne , satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell 's meaning to love Captain Wentworth as she ought , had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value .
Lady Russell	She had but two friends in the world to add to his list , Lady Russell and Mrs Smith .
Lady Russell	Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for Mrs Smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently .
Lady Russell	An hour 's complete leisure for such reflections as these , on a dark November day , a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows , was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell 's carriage exceedingly welcome ; and yet , though desirous to be gone , she could not quit the Mansion House , or look an adieu to the Cottage , with its black , dripping and comfortless veranda , or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village , without a saddened heart .
Lady Russell	Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell 's house in September . It had not been necessary , and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and escape from .
Lady Russell	There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell 's joy in meeting her .
Lady Russell	She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross . But happily , either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks , or Lady Russell fancied her so ; and Anne , in receiving her compliments on the occasion , had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin , and of hoping that she was to be blessed with
Lady Russell	Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father 's house in Camden Place , or her own sister 's intimacy with Mrs Clay . She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her .
Lady Russell	Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before , when a full account of the whole had burst on her ; but still it must be talked of , she must make enquiries , she must regret the imprudence , lament the result , and Captain Wentworth 's name must be mentioned by both .
Lady Russell	Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell .
Lady Russell	She could not speak the name , and look straight forward to Lady Russell 's eye , till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa .
Lady Russell	Lady Russell had only to listen composedly , and wish them happy , but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure , in pleased contempt , that the man who at twenty - three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an Anne Elliot , should , eight years afterwards , be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove .
Lady Russell	"The first three or four days passed most quietly , with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme , which found their way to Anne , she could not tell how , and brought a rather improving account of Louisa . At the end of that period , Lady Russell 's politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self - threatenings of the past became in a decided tone , "" I must call on Mrs Croft ; I really must call upon her soon . Anne , have you courage to go with me , and pay a visit in that house ?"
Lady Russell	"It will be some trial to us both . "" Anne did not shrink from it ; on the contrary , she truly felt as she said , in observing-- "" I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two ; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine ."
Lady Russell	"By remaining in the neighbourhood , I am become inured to it . """
Lady Russell	"She could have said more on the subject ; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts , and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants , felt the parish to be so sure of a good example , and the poor of the best attention and relief , that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal , she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay , and that Kellynch Hall had passed into better hands than its owners ' . These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain , and severe was its kind ; but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again , and returning through the well - known apartments . In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself , "" These rooms ought to belong only to us . Oh , how fallen in their destination ! How unworthily occupied !"
Lady Russell	"This is breaking a head and giving a plaster , truly ! "" Admiral Croft 's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell , but they delighted Anne ."
Lady Russell	Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other : but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present ; for when it was returned , the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks , to visit their connexions in the north of the county , and probably might not be at home again before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath . So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall , or of seeing him in company with her friend .
Lady Russell	Lady Russell , convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use , or any importance , in the choice of the house which they were going to secure , was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon , and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas ; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks , she was unable to give the full invitation she wished , and
Lady Russell	This invitation of Mary 's removed all Lady Russell 's difficulties , and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her , and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge .
Lady Russell	So far all was perfectly right ; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan , when it burst on her , which was , Mrs Clay 's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth , as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her .
Lady Russell	Lady Russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all , wondered , grieved , and feared ; and the affront it contained to Anne , in Mrs Clay 's being of so much use , while Anne could be of none , was a very sore aggravation .
Lady Russell	Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts ; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell .
Lady Russell	Lady Russell felt this break - up of the family exceedingly .
Lady Russell	Their respectability was as dear to her as her own , and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit .
Lady Russell	It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds , and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into ; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village , and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived , she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne .
Lady Russell	Accordingly their removal was made together , and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage , in the first stage of Lady Russell 's journey . Uppercross was a moderate - sized village , which a few years back had been completely in the old English style , containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers ; the mansion of the squire , with its high walls , great gates , and old trees , substantial and unmodernized , and the compact , tight parsonage , enclosed in its own neat garden , with a vine and a pear - tree trained round its casements ; but upon the marriage of the young ' squire , it had received the improvement of a farm - house elevated into a cottage , for his residence , and Uppercross Cottage , with its veranda , French windows , and other prettiness , was quite as likely to catch the traveller 's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House , about a quarter of a mile farther on .
Lady Russell	So , Lady Russell would not get out .
Lady Russell	"I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer . "" Anne said what was proper , and enquired after her husband ."
Lady Russell	"You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner . """
Lady Russell	I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie , trying to understand , and make him understand , which of Elizabeth 's plants are for Lady Russell .
Mrs. Croft	She wished , however to see the Crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned . They came : the master of the house was not at home , but the two sisters were together ; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne , while the Admiral sat by Mary , and made himself very agreeable by his good - humoured notice of her little boys , she was well able to watch for a likeness , and if it failed her in the features , to catch it in the voice , or in the turn of sentiment and expression . Mrs Croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person . She had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather - beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight - and - thirty . Her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour .
Mrs. Croft	"Anne gave her credit , indeed , for feelings of great consideration towards herself , in all that related to Kellynch , and it pleased her : especially , as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute , in the instant even of introduction , that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft 's side , to give a bias of any sort . She was quite easy on that head , and consequently full of strength and courage , till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft 's suddenly saying,-- "" It was you , and not your sister , I find , that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with , when he was in this country ."
Mrs. Croft	""" Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married ? "" added Mrs Croft ."
Mrs. Croft	She could now answer as she ought ; and was happy to feel , when Mrs Croft 's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke , that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother .
Mrs. Croft	She immediately felt how reasonable it was , that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward , and not of Frederick ; and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour 's present state with proper interest .
Mrs. Croft	"The rest was all tranquillity ; till , just as they were moving , she heard the Admiral say to Mary-- "" We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft 's here soon ; I dare say you know him by name . """
Mrs. Croft	"Charles , in the meanwhile , was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt , now that he was so near ; and very evidently , though more fearfully , trying to induce his wife to go too . But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength ; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop , as she felt so tired , she resolutely answered , "" Oh ! no , indeed !"
Mrs. Croft	"walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good ; "" and , in short , her look and manner declared , that go she would not ."
Mrs. Croft	"Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to Henrietta , Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to Captain Wentworth-- "" It is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life . "" She received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of ."
Mrs. Croft	; she quarrelled with her own seat , was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere , and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also . She turned through the same gate , but could not see them .
Mrs. Croft	Mary sat down for a moment , but it would not do ; she was sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else , and she would go on
Mrs. Croft	till she overtook her
Mrs. Croft	The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand ; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman 's side , and a relenting on the lady 's , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt . Henrietta looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased;-- Charles Hayter exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross . Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two .
Mrs. Croft	She joined Charles and Mary , and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles 's other arm ; but Charles , though in very good humour with her , was out of temper with his wife .
Mrs. Croft	Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him , and was now to reap the consequence , which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch ; and when Mary began to complain of it , and lament her being ill - used , according to custom , in being on the hedge side , while Anne was never incommoded on the other , he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of , and they could hardly get him along at all .
Mrs. Croft	He and his wife had taken their intended drive , and were returning home .
Mrs. Croft	""" Miss Elliot , I am sure you are tired , "" cried Mrs Croft ."
Mrs. Croft	The Admiral 's kind urgency came in support of his wife 's ; they would not be refused ; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner , and Captain Wentworth , without saying a word , turned to her , and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage .
Mrs. Croft	""" "" We had better not talk about it , my dear , "" replied Mrs Croft , pleasantly ; "" for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding , she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together ."
Mrs. Croft	"I had known you by character , however , long before . "" "" Well , and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl , and what were we to wait for besides ?"
Mrs. Croft	I do not like having such things so long in hand . I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass , and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch . Then there would always be company for them . And very nice young ladies they both are ; I hardly know one from the other .
Mrs. Croft	""" "" Very good humoured , unaffected girls , indeed , "" said Mrs Croft , in a tone of calmer praise , such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother ; "" and a very respectable family ."
Mrs. Croft	My dear Admiral , that post !
Mrs. Croft	It was three weeks since she had heard at all . She only knew that Henrietta was at home again ; and that Louisa , though considered to be recovering fast , was still in Lyme ; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening , when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to her ; and , to quicken the pleasure and surprise , with Admiral and Mrs Croft 's compliments .
Mrs. Croft	Mrs Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long .
Mrs. Croft	In the first place , I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday , offering to convey anything to you ; a very kind , friendly note indeed , addressed to me , just as it ought ; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like . The Admiral does not seem very ill , and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants .
Mrs. Croft	Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister 's account ; but , however , Louisa is a great favourite with both .
Mrs. Croft	Indeed , Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her .
Mrs. Croft	This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth 's share of interest in the letter ; when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove , and her fine little boys , Anne was at liberty . In her own room , she tried to comprehend it .
Mrs. Croft	He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout , and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares with him in everything , and to walk for her life to do him good .
Mrs. Croft	Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the Admiral 's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her . Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft 's arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend 's carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral .
Mrs. Croft	"The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way . "" When they were got a little farther , Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate . She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified ; but she was still obliged to wait , for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont ; and as she was not really Mrs Croft , she must let him have his own way ."
Mrs. Croft	"I fancy they are all at Uppercross . "" This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist ; she said , therefore , "" I hope , Admiral , I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth 's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy ."
Mrs. Croft	"A house was never taken good care of , Mr Shepherd observed , without a lady : he did not know , whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady , as where there were many children . A lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world . He had seen Mrs Croft , too ; she was at Taunton with the admiral , and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over . "" And a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be , "" continued he ; "" asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the Admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , Sir Walter , I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford . Bless me !"
Mrs. Croft	Penelope , my dear , can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford : Mrs Croft 's brother ?
Mrs. Croft	The party before her were , Mrs Musgrove , talking to Mrs Croft , and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth ; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta , too impatient to wait , had gone out the moment it had cleared , but would be back again soon , and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned . She had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed . There was no delay , no waste of time .
Mrs. Croft	"She was deep in the happiness of such misery , or the misery of such happiness , instantly . Two minutes after her entering the room , Captain Wentworth said-- "" We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials . "" Materials were at hand , on a separate table ; he went to it , and nearly turning his back to them all , was engrossed by writing . Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter 's engagement , and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper ."
Mrs. Croft	Mrs Croft was attending with great good - humour , and whenever she spoke at all , it was very sensibly .
Mrs. Croft	""" And so , ma'am , all these thing considered , "" said Mrs Musgrove , in her powerful whisper , "" though we could have wished it different , yet , altogether , we did not think it fair to stand out any longer , for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it , and Henrietta was pretty near as bad ; and so we thought they had better marry at once , and make the best of it , as many others have done before them ."
Mrs. Croft	""" "" That is precisely what I was going to observe , "" cried Mrs Croft ."
Mrs. Croft	""" I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once , and have to struggle with a few difficulties together , than be involved in a long engagement . I always think that no mutual-- "" "" Oh ! dear Mrs Croft , "" cried Mrs Musgrove , unable to let her finish her speech , "" there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement ."
Mrs. Croft	"It is all very well , I used to say , for young people to be engaged , if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months , or even in twelve ; but a long engagement-- "" "" Yes , dear ma'am , "" said Mrs Croft , "" or an uncertain engagement , an engagement which may be long ."
Mrs. Croft	"To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying , I hold to be very unsafe and unwise , and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can . """
Mrs. Croft	Mrs Croft was taking leave .
Mrs. Croft	""" Here , Frederick , you and I part company , I believe , "" said she ."
Mrs. Croft	""" I am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend ."
Mrs. Croft	"To - night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party , "" ( turning to Anne . ) "" We had your sister 's card yesterday , and I understood Frederick had a card too , though I did not see it ; and you are disengaged , Frederick , are you not , as well as ourselves ? "" Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste , and either could not or would not answer fully ."
Mrs. Croft	Mrs Croft left them , and Captain Wentworth , having sealed his letter with great rapidity , was indeed ready , and had even a hurried , agitated air , which shewed impatience to be gone .
Mrs. Croft	""" By all means , my dear , "" cried Mrs Musgrove , "" go home directly , and take care of yourself , that you may be fit for the evening ."
Mrs. Croft	I wish Sarah was here to doctor you , but I am no doctor myself .
Mrs. Croft	my dear , it is quite understood , I give you my word .
Mrs. Croft	""" "" Do you think so ? But I am afraid ; and I should be so very sorry ."
Mrs. Croft	Will you promise me to mention it , when you see them again ?
Mrs. Croft	You will see them both this morning , I dare say .
Mrs. Croft	"Do promise me . "" "" To be sure I will , if you wish it ."
Mrs. Croft	But indeed , my dear , you need not be uneasy .
Mrs. Croft	Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged , I 'll answer for it ; and Captain Wentworth the same , I dare say .
Mrs. Croft	""" I found , "" said he , "" that I was considered by Harville an engaged man ! That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment ."
Mrs. Croft	To a degree , I could contradict this instantly ; but , when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same -- her own family , nay , perhaps herself -- I was no longer at my own disposal .
Mrs. Croft	I was hers in honour if she wished it .
Mrs. Croft	""" What a great traveller you must have been , ma'am ! "" said Mrs Musgrove to Mrs Croft ."
Mrs. Croft	""" And I do assure you , ma'am , "" pursued Mrs Croft , "" that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man - of - war ; I speak , you know , of the higher rates ."
Mrs. Croft	When you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and I can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship . While we were together , you know , there was nothing to be feared .
Mrs. Croft	I have always been blessed with excellent health , and no climate disagrees with me .
Mrs. Croft	A little disordered always the first twenty - four hours of going to sea , but never knew what sickness was afterwards . The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind , the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell , or had any ideas of danger , was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal , when the Admiral ( Captain Croft then ) was in the North Seas .
Mrs. Croft	I lived in perpetual fright at that time , and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself , or when I should hear from him next ; but as long as we could be together , nothing ever ailed me , and I never met with the smallest inconvenience .
Mrs. Croft	""" Aye , to be sure . Yes , indeed , oh yes ! I am quite of your opinion , Mrs Croft , "" was Mrs Musgrove 's hearty answer ."
Mrs. Croft	I am quite of your opinion .
Captain Wentworth	He had been several years at sea , and had , in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable , and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of , been six months on board Captain Frederick Wentworth 's frigate , the Laconia ; and from the Laconia he had , under the influence of his captain , written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence ; that is to say , the only two disinterested letters ; all the rest had been mere applications for money .
Captain Wentworth	In each letter he had spoken well of his captain ; but yet , so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters , so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships , that it had made scarcely any impression at the time ; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck , this very day , with a recollection of the name of Wentworth , as connected with her son , seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur . She had gone to her letters , and found it all as she supposed ; and the re - perusal of these letters , after so long an interval , her poor son gone for ever , and all the strength of his faults forgotten , had affected her spirits exceedingly , and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death . Mr Musgrove was , in a lesser degree , affected likewise ; and when they reached the cottage , they were evidently in want , first , of being listened to anew on this subject , and afterwards , of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them . To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth , repeating his name so often , puzzling over past years , and at last ascertaining that it might , that it probably would , turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting , once or twice , after their coming back from Clifton -- a very fine young man -- but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago , was a new sort of trial to Anne 's nerves .
Captain Wentworth	"Since he actually was expected in the country , she must teach herself to be insensible on such points . And not only did it appear that he was expected , and speedily , but the Musgroves , in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick , and very high respect for his character , stamped as it was by poor Dick 's having been six months under his care , and mentioning him in strong , though not perfectly well - spelt praise , as "" a fine dashing felow , only two perticular about the schoolmaster , "" were bent on introducing themselves , and seeking his acquaintance , as soon as they could hear of his arrival . The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening ."
Captain Wentworth	Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion , though too wise to acknowledge as much at home , where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife ; for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite , she could not but think , as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience , that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either .
Captain Wentworth	They were more in love with him ; yet there it was not love .
Captain Wentworth	She did not attribute guile to any . It was the highest satisfaction to her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning .
Captain Wentworth	There was no triumph , no pitiful triumph in his manner .
Captain Wentworth	He had , probably , never heard , and never thought of any claims of Charles Hayter .
Captain Wentworth	He was only wrong in accepting the attentions ( for accepting must be the word ) of two young women at once .
Captain Wentworth	One morning , about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth being gone a - shooting together , as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion - house .
Captain Wentworth	She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations ; but it was not possible , that when within reach of Captain Wentworth 's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves , she should not try to hear it ; yet she caught little very remarkable .
Captain Wentworth	He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta .
Captain Wentworth	Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister .
Captain Wentworth	"After one of the many praises of the day , which were continually bursting forth , Captain Wentworth added : -- "" What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister !"
Captain Wentworth	I wonder whereabouts they will upset to - day .
Captain Wentworth	it does happen very often , I assure you ; but my sister makes nothing of it ; she would as lieve be tossed out as not .
Captain Wentworth	"You make the most of it , I know , "" cried Louisa , "" but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place . If I loved a man , as she loves the Admiral , I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else . "" It was spoken with enthusiasm . "" Had you ? "" cried he , catching the same tone ; "" I honour you ! """
Captain Wentworth	"Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to Henrietta , Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to Captain Wentworth-- "" It is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life . "" She received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of ."
Captain Wentworth	The brow of the hill , where they remained , was a cheerful spot : Louisa returned ; and Mary , finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile , was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her ; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away , to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge - row , and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound , Mary was happy no longer
Captain Wentworth	Anne , really tired herself , was glad to sit down ; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge - row , behind her , as if making their way back along the rough , wild sort of channel , down the centre .
Captain Wentworth	"What Anne first heard was-- "" And so , I made her go . I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . What !"
Captain Wentworth	would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do , and that I knew to be right , by the airs and interference of such a person , or of any person I may say ?
Captain Wentworth	No , I have no idea of being so easily persuaded .
Captain Wentworth	When I have made up my mind , I have made it ; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to - day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance !
Captain Wentworth	After the hints you gave just now , which did but confirm my own observations , the last time I was in company with him , I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on . I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this . Your sister is an amiable creature ; but yours is the character of decision and firmness , I see .
Captain Wentworth	"Here is a nut , "" said he , catching one down from an upper bough ."
Captain Wentworth	"This nut , "" he continued , with playful solemnity , "" while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot , is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of . """
Captain Wentworth	"Then returning to his former earnest tone-- "" My first wish for all whom I am interested in , is that they should be firm ."
Captain Wentworth	""" He had done , and was unanswered . It would have surprised Anne if Louisa could have readily answered such a speech : words of such interest , spoken with such serious warmth !"
Captain Wentworth	"After a moment 's pause , Captain Wentworth said-- "" Do you mean that she refused him ? """
Captain Wentworth	She saw how her own character was considered by Captain Wentworth , and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation .
Captain Wentworth	The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand ; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman 's side , and a relenting on the lady 's , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt . Henrietta looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased;-- Charles Hayter exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross . Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two .
Captain Wentworth	Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him , and was now to reap the consequence , which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch ; and when Mary began to complain of it , and lament her being ill - used , according to custom , in being on the hedge side , while Anne was never incommoded on the other , he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of , and they could hardly get him along at all .
Captain Wentworth	This long meadow bordered a lane , which their footpath , at the end of it was to cross , and when the party had all reached the gate of exit , the carriage advancing in the same direction , which had been some time heard , was just coming up , and proved to be Admiral Croft 's gig .
Captain Wentworth	He and his wife had taken their intended drive , and were returning home .
Captain Wentworth	The walking party had crossed the lane , and were surmounting an opposite stile , and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again , when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister . The something might be guessed by its effects .
Captain Wentworth	Here is excellent room for three , I assure you .
Captain Wentworth	If we were all like you , I believe we might sit four .
Captain Wentworth	The Admiral 's kind urgency came in support of his wife 's ; they would not be refused ; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner , and Captain Wentworth , without saying a word , turned to her , and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage .
Captain Wentworth	Yes ; he had done it .
Captain Wentworth	She was in the carriage , and felt that he had placed her there , that his will and his hands had done it , that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue , and his resolution to give her rest .
Captain Wentworth	She was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her , which all these things made apparent .
Captain Wentworth	She understood him .
Captain Wentworth	He could not forgive her , but he could not be unfeeling .
Captain Wentworth	Though condemning her for the past , and considering it with high and unjust resentment , though perfectly careless of her , and though becoming attached to another , still he could not see her suffer , without the desire of giving her relief .
Captain Wentworth	It was a remainder of former sentiment ; it was an impulse of pure , though unacknowledged friendship ; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart , which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain , that she knew not which prevailed . Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given . They had travelled half their way along the rough lane , before she was quite awake to what they said .
Captain Wentworth	"She then found them talking of "" Frederick . "" "" He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , Sophy , "" said the Admiral ; "" but there is no saying which ."
Captain Wentworth	How many days was it , my dear , between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth ?
Captain Wentworth	My dear Admiral , that post !
Captain Wentworth	"She then found them talking of "" Frederick . "" "" He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , Sophy , "" said the Admiral ; "" but there is no saying which ."
Captain Wentworth	He has been running after them , too , long enough , one would think , to make up his mind .
Captain Wentworth	If it were war now , he would have settled it long ago .
Captain Wentworth	I do not like having such things so long in hand . I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass , and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch . Then there would always be company for them . And very nice young ladies they both are ; I hardly know one from the other .
Captain Wentworth	It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth , within half a mile of him ; they would have to frequent the same church , and there must be intercourse between the two families .
Captain Wentworth	This was against her ; but on the other hand , he spent so much of his time at Uppercross , that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind , than as going towards him ; and , upon the whole , she believed she must , on this interesting question , be the gainer , almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society , in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell
Captain Wentworth	She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall : those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her ; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere .
Captain Wentworth	They did not like each other , and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good ; and were Lady Russell to see them together , she might think that he had too much self - possession , and she too little . These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross , where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough .
Captain Wentworth	Captain Wentworth , after being unseen and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days , appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away .
Captain Wentworth	A letter from his friend , Captain Harville , having found him out at last , had brought intelligence of Captain Harville 's being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter ; of their being therefore , quite unknowingly , within twenty miles of each other .
Captain Wentworth	Captain Harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before , and Captain Wentworth 's anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme .
Captain Wentworth	He had been there for four - and - twenty hours .
Captain Wentworth	His acquittal was complete , his friendship warmly honoured , a lively interest excited for his friend , and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party , that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves , and a project for going thither was the consequence . The young people were all wild to see Lyme .
Captain Wentworth	Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself , it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross ; though November , the weather was by no means bad ; and , in short , Louisa , who was the most eager of the eager , having formed the resolution to go , and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked , being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way , bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer ; and to Lyme they were to go -- Charles , Mary , Anne , Henrietta , Louisa , and Captain Wentworth .
Captain Wentworth	The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this Mr Musgrove , for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning . They were , consequently , to stay the night there , and not to be expected back till the next day 's dinner . This was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages , Mr Musgrove 's coach containing the four ladies , and Charles 's curricle , in which he drove Captain Wentworth , were descending the long hill into Lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone . After securing accommodations , and ordering a dinner at one of the inns , the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea .
Captain Wentworth	The rooms were shut up , the lodgers almost all gone , scarcely any family but of the residents left ; and , as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves , the remarkable situation of the town , the principal street almost hurrying into the water , the walk to the Cobb , skirting round the pleasant little bay , which , in the season , is animated with bathing machines and company ; the Cobb itself , its old wonders and new improvements , with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town , are what the stranger 's eye will seek ; and a very strange stranger it must be , who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme , to make him wish to know it better . The scenes in its neighbourhood , Charmouth , with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country , and still more , its sweet , retired bay , backed by dark cliffs , where fragments of low rock among the sands , make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide , for sitting in unwearied contemplation ; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme ; and , above all , Pinny , with its green chasms between romantic rocks , where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth , declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state , where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited , as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far - famed Isle of Wight : these places must be visited , and visited again , to make the worth of Lyme understood . The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms , and still descending , soon found themselves on the sea - shore ; and lingering only , as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea , who ever deserved to look on it at all , proceeded towards the Cobb , equally their object in itself and on Captain Wentworth 's account : for in a small house , near the foot of an old pier of unknown date , were the Harvilles settled . Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend ; the others walked on , and he was to join them on the Cobb .
Captain Wentworth	They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring ; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long , when they saw him coming after them , with three companions , all well known already , by description , to be Captain and Mrs Harville , and a Captain Benwick , who was staying with them .
Captain Wentworth	Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia ; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him , on his return from Lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies .
Captain Wentworth	Fortune came , his prize - money as lieutenant being great ; promotion , too , came at last ; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it .
Captain Wentworth	She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea .
Captain Wentworth	Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville , or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change . He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily , uniting very strong feelings with quiet , serious , and retiring manners , and a decided taste for reading , and sedentary pursuits . To finish the interest of the story , the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed , if possible , augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance , and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely .
Captain Wentworth	"He will rally again , and be happy with another . "" They all met , and were introduced . Captain Harville was a tall , dark man , with a sensible , benevolent countenance ; a little lame ; and from strong features and want of health , looking much older than Captain Wentworth ."
Captain Wentworth	Captain Harville , though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners , was a perfect gentleman , unaffected , warm , and obliging .
Captain Wentworth	Mrs Harville , a degree less polished than her husband , seemed , however , to have the same good feelings ; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own , because the friends of Captain Wentworth , or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them . The dinner , already ordered at the inn , was at last , though unwillingly , accepted as a excuse ; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should have brought any such party to Lyme , without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them .
Captain Wentworth	There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this , and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon , so unlike the usual style of give - and - take invitations , and dinners of formality and display , that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother - officers .
Captain Wentworth	The varieties in the fitting - up of the rooms , where the common necessaries provided by the owner , in the common indifferent plight , were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood , excellently worked up , and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited , were more than amusing to Anne ; connected as it all was with his profession , the fruit of its labours , the effect of its influence on his habits , the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented , made it to her a something more , or less , than gratification .
Captain Wentworth	Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in Captain Wentworth 's company than she had at first imagined could ever be , that the sitting down to the same table with him now , and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it ( they never got beyond ) , was become a mere nothing .
Captain Wentworth	He was shy , and disposed to abstraction ; but the engaging mildness of her countenance , and gentleness of her manners , soon had their effect ; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion . He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading , though principally in poetry ; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening 's indulgence in the discussion of subjects , which his usual companions had probably no concern in , she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction , which had naturally grown out of their conversation . For , though shy , he did not seem reserved ; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints ; and having talked of poetry , the richness of the present age , and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first - rate poets , trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred , and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos ; and moreover , how the Giaour was to be pronounced , he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet , and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other ; he repeated , with such tremulous feeling , the various lines which imaged a broken heart , or a mind destroyed by wretchedness , and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood , that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry , and to say , that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely ; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly . His looks shewing him not pained , but pleased with this allusion to his situation , she was emboldened to go on ; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind , she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study ; and on being requested to particularize , mentioned such works of our best moralists , such collections of the finest letters , such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering , as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts , and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances . Captain Benwick listened attentively , and seemed grateful for the interest implied ; and though with a shake of the head , and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his , noted down the names of those she recommended , and promised to procure and read them
Captain Wentworth	A very few days more , and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch , and Mr Musgrove had called on him , and come back warm in his praise , and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross , by the end of another week . It had been a great disappointment to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed , so impatient was he to shew his gratitude , by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own roof , and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars . But a week must pass ; only a week , in Anne 's reckoning , and then , she supposed , they must meet ; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week .
Captain Wentworth	Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove 's civility , and she was all but calling there in the same half hour .
Captain Wentworth	She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House , where , as she afterwards learnt , they must inevitably have found him , when they were stopped by the eldest boy 's being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall . The child 's situation put the visit entirely aside ; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference , even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account .
Captain Wentworth	Till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar - bone was soon replaced , and though Mr Robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew 's state , as to give the information of Captain Wentworth 's visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before .
Captain Wentworth	How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner , how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power , and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma 's farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow -- actually on the morrow ; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner , as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought . And in short , he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace , that they could assure them all , their heads were both turned by him ; and off they ran , quite as full of glee as of love , and apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles .
Captain Wentworth	The same story and the same raptures were repeated , when the two girls came with their father , through the gloom of the evening , to make enquiries ; and Mr Musgrove , no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir , could add his confirmation and praise , and hope there would be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off , and only be sorry to think
Captain Wentworth	"Charles Musgrove , indeed , afterwards , shewed more of inclination ; "" the child was going on so well , and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth , that , perhaps , he might join them in the evening ; he would not dine from home , but he might walk in for half an hour . "" But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife , with "" Oh !"
Captain Wentworth	It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine ; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm , and Charles Musgrove began , consequently , to feel no necessity for longer confinement .
Captain Wentworth	This was quite a female case , and it would be highly absurd in him , who could be of no use at home , to shut himself up .
Captain Wentworth	His father very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth , and there being no sufficient reason against it , he ought to go ; and it ended in his making a bold , public declaration , when he came in from shooting , of his meaning to dress directly , and dine at the other house .
Captain Wentworth	I shall certainly go ; I am sure I ought if I can , quite as much as Charles , for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth , and I know you do not mind being left alone .
Captain Wentworth	Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause , and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him , where conviction was at least very agreeable , he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone , though he still wanted her to join them in the evening , when the child might be at rest for the night , and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her , but she was quite unpersuadable ; and this being the case , she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits . They were gone , she hoped , to be happy , however oddly constructed such happiness might seem ; as for herself , she was left with as many sensations of comfort , as were , perhaps , ever likely to be hers . She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child ; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant , making himself agreeable to others ?
Captain Wentworth	She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting .
Captain Wentworth	He must be either indifferent or unwilling .
Captain Wentworth	Had he wished ever to see her again , he need not have waited till this time ; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago , when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting .
Captain Wentworth	There had been music , singing , talking , laughing , all that was most agreeable ; charming manners in Captain Wentworth , no shyness or reserve ; they seemed all to know each other perfectly , and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with Charles .
Captain Wentworth	He was to come to breakfast , but not at the Cottage , though that had been proposed at first ; but then he had been pressed to come to the Great House instead , and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs Charles Musgrove 's way , on account of the child , and therefore , somehow , they hardly knew how , it ended in Charles 's being to meet him to breakfast at his father 's .
Captain Wentworth	He wished to avoid seeing her .
Captain Wentworth	He had inquired after her , she found , slightly , as might suit a former slight acquaintance , seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged , actuated , perhaps , by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet .
Captain Wentworth	The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child 's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice . Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over .
Captain Wentworth	Her eye half met Captain Wentworth 's , a bow , a curtsey passed ; she heard his voice ; he talked to Mary , said all that was right , said something to the Miss Musgroves , enough to mark an easy footing ; the room seemed full , full of persons and voices , but a few minutes ended it .
Captain Wentworth	"Charles shewed himself at the window , all was ready , their visitor had bowed and was gone , the Miss Musgroves were gone too , suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen : the room was cleared , and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could . "" It is over !"
Captain Wentworth	She had seen him .
Captain Wentworth	Now , how were his sentiments to be read ?
Captain Wentworth	"On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented , she was soon spared all suspense ; for , after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary : -- "" Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you , Anne , though he was so attentive to me ."
Captain Wentworth	Henrietta asked him what he thought of you , when they went away , and he said , ` You were so altered he should not have known you again . '
Captain Wentworth	"Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister 's in a common way , but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound . "" Altered beyond his knowledge . """
Captain Wentworth	Doubtless it was so , and she could take no revenge , for he was not altered , or not for the worse .
Captain Wentworth	She had already acknowledged it to herself , and she could not think differently , let him think of her as he would .
Captain Wentworth	No : the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing , manly , open look , in no respect lessening his personal advantages .
Captain Wentworth	She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth .
Captain Wentworth	""" So altered that he should not have known her again ! """
Captain Wentworth	Frederick Wentworth had used such words , or something like them , but without an idea that they would be carried round to her . He had thought her wretchedly altered , and in the first moment of appeal , had spoken as he felt . He had not forgiven Anne Elliot . She had used him ill , deserted and disappointed him ; and worse , she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so , which his own decided , confident temper could not endure .
Captain Wentworth	She had given him up to oblige others .
Captain Wentworth	He had been most warmly attached to her , and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal ; but , except from some natural sensation of curiosity , he had no desire of meeting her again . Her power with him was gone for ever . It was now his object to marry .
Captain Wentworth	He was rich , and being turned on shore , fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted ; actually looking round , ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow . He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves , if they could catch it ; a heart , in short , for any pleasing young woman who came in his way , excepting Anne Elliot .
Captain Wentworth	"This was his only secret exception , when he said to his sister , in answer to her suppositions:-- "" Yes , here I am , Sophia , quite ready to make a foolish match ."
Captain Wentworth	Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking . A little beauty , and a few smiles , and a few compliments to the navy , and I am a lost man .
Captain Wentworth	"Should not this be enough for a sailor , who has had no society among women to make him nice ? "" He said it , she knew , to be contradicted . His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice ; and Anne Elliot was not out of his thoughts , when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with ."
Captain Wentworth	""" That is the woman I want , "" said he ."
Captain Wentworth	""" Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with , but it must not be much ."
Captain Wentworth	"If I am a fool , I shall be a fool indeed , for I have thought on the subject more than most men . """
Captain Wentworth	But hardly were they so settled , when the door opened again , and Captain Wentworth walked in alone .
Captain Wentworth	Anne was the nearest to him , and making yet a little advance , she instantly spoke .
Captain Wentworth	"He was preparing only to bow and pass on , but her gentle "" How do you do ? "" brought him out of the straight line to stand near her , and make enquiries in return , in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground ."
Captain Wentworth	Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne ; she knew nothing of their looks , and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done . While they were speaking , a whispering between her father and Elizabeth caught her ear . She could not distinguish , but she must guess the subject ; and on Captain Wentworth 's making a distant bow , she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance , and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself .
Captain Wentworth	"After talking , however , of the weather , and Bath , and the concert , their conversation began to flag , and so little was said at last , that she was expecting him to go every moment , but he did not ; he seemed in no hurry to leave her ; and presently with renewed spirit , with a little smile , a little glow , he said-- "" I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme ."
Captain Wentworth	"I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock , and the more from its not overpowering you at the time . """
Captain Wentworth	"She assured him that she had not . """
Captain Wentworth	"It was a frightful hour , "" said he , "" a frightful day ! """
Captain Wentworth	"and he passed his hand across his eyes , as if the remembrance were still too painful , but in a moment , half smiling again , added , "" The day has produced some effects however ; has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful ."
Captain Wentworth	""" "" Yes , "" said he , looking not exactly forward ; "" but there , I think , ends the resemblance ."
Captain Wentworth	With all my soul I wish them happy , and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it . They have no difficulties to contend with at home , no opposition , no caprice , no delays .
Captain Wentworth	"All this is much , very much in favour of their happiness ; more than perhaps-- "" He stopped ."
Captain Wentworth	A sudden recollection seemed to occur , and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne 's cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground .
Captain Wentworth	"After clearing his throat , however , he proceeded thus-- "" I confess that I do think there is a disparity , too great a disparity , and in a point no less essential than mind ."
Captain Wentworth	I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable , sweet - tempered girl , and not deficient in understanding , but Benwick is something more .
Captain Wentworth	He is a clever man , a reading man ; and I confess , that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise . Had it been the effect of gratitude , had he learnt to love her , because he believed her to be preferring him , it would have been another thing . But I have no reason to suppose it so .
Captain Wentworth	It seems , on the contrary , to have been a perfectly spontaneous , untaught feeling on his side , and this surprises me .
Captain Wentworth	"A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman . He ought not ; he does not . "" Either from the consciousness , however , that his friend had recovered , or from other consciousness , he went no farther ; and Anne who , in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered , and in spite of all the various noises of the room , the almost ceaseless slam of the door , and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through , had distinguished every word , was struck , gratified , confused , and beginning to breathe very quick , and feel an hundred things in a moment . It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject ; and yet , after a pause , feeling the necessity of speaking , and having not the smallest wish for a total change , she only deviated so far as to say-- "" You were a good while at Lyme , I think ? "" "" About a fortnight . I could not leave it till Louisa 's doing well was quite ascertained ."
Captain Wentworth	I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace .
Captain Wentworth	It had been my doing , solely mine .
Captain Wentworth	She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak .
Captain Wentworth	I walked and rode a great deal ; and the more I saw , the more I found to admire .
Captain Wentworth	""" Lady Dalrymple , Lady Dalrymple , "" was the rejoicing sound ; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance , Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her . Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , escorted by Mr Elliot and Colonel Wallis , who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant , advanced into the room . The others joined them , and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included . She was divided from Captain Wentworth ."
Captain Wentworth	Their interesting , almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time , but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on ! She had learnt , in the last ten minutes , more of his feelings towards Louisa , more of all his feelings than she dared to think of ; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party , to the needful civilities of the moment , with exquisite , though agitated sensations .
Captain Wentworth	The delightful emotions were a little subdued , when on stepping back from the group , to be joined again by Captain Wentworth , she saw that he was gone . She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room .
Captain Wentworth	He was gone ; he had disappeared , she felt a moment 's regret .
Captain Wentworth	He would look for her , he would find her out before the evening were over , and at present , perhaps , it was as well to be asunder .
Captain Wentworth	His choice of subjects , his expressions , and still more his manner and look , had been such as she could see in only one light .
Captain Wentworth	His opinion of Louisa Musgrove 's inferiority , an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give , his wonder at Captain Benwick , his feelings as to a first , strong attachment ; sentences begun which he could not finish , his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance , all , all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least ; that anger , resentment , avoidance , were no more ; and that they were succeeded , not merely by friendship and regard , but by the tenderness of the past . Yes , some share of the tenderness of the past . She could not contemplate the change as implying less .
Captain Wentworth	He must love her .
Captain Wentworth	These were thoughts , with their attendant visions , which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation ; and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him , without even trying to discern him .
Captain Wentworth	When their places were determined on , and they were all properly arranged , she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room , but he was not ; her eye could not reach him ; and the concert being just opening , she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way .
Captain Wentworth	""" I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long , "" replied he , "" without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot ; and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments , and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman ."
Captain Wentworth	""" "" I knew you by report long before you came to Bath ."
Captain Wentworth	I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately . I have been acquainted with you by character many years .
Captain Wentworth	"Your person , your disposition , accomplishments , manner ; they were all present to me . "" Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise ."
Captain Wentworth	He would mention no names now ; but such , he could assure her , had been the fact .
Captain Wentworth	He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her .
Captain Wentworth	Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford , Captain Wentworth 's brother .
Captain Wentworth	"He might have been in Mr Elliot 's company , but she had not courage to ask the question . "" The name of Anne Elliot , "" said he , "" has long had an interesting sound to me ."
Captain Wentworth	Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy ; and , if I dared , I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change .
Captain Wentworth	""" Such , she believed , were his words ; but scarcely had she received their sound , than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her , which rendered every thing else trivial ."
Captain Wentworth	""" A well - looking man , "" said Sir Walter , "" a very well - looking man . """
Captain Wentworth	""" A very fine young man indeed ! "" said Lady Dalrymple ."
Captain Wentworth	""" No , I just know his name ."
Captain Wentworth	A bowing acquaintance .
Captain Wentworth	Wentworth ; Captain Wentworth of the navy .
Captain Wentworth	"His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire , the Croft , who rents Kellynch . "" Before Sir Walter had reached this point , Anne 's eyes had caught the right direction , and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance ."
Captain Wentworth	As her eyes fell on him , his seemed to be withdrawn from her .
Captain Wentworth	She remained in her seat , and so did Lady Russell ; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot ; and she did not mean , whatever she might feel on Lady Russell 's account , to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth , if he gave her the opportunity .
Captain Wentworth	She was persuaded by Lady Russell 's countenance that she had seen him . He did not come however .
Captain Wentworth	Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance , but he never came .
Captain Wentworth	She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more , without the interchange of one friendly look .
Captain Wentworth	She could not do so , without comparing herself with Miss Larolles , the inimitable Miss Larolles ; but still she did it , and not with much happier effect ; though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours , she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed . Such was her situation , with a vacant space at hand , when Captain Wentworth was again in sight . She saw him not far off .
Captain Wentworth	He saw her too ; yet he looked grave , and seemed irresolute , and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her . She felt that something must be the matter . The change was indubitable . The difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room was strikingly great .
Captain Wentworth	He began by speaking of the concert gravely , more like the Captain Wentworth of Uppercross ; owned himself disappointed , had expected singing ; and in short , must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over .
Captain Wentworth	Anne replied , and spoke in defence of the performance so well , and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly , that his countenance improved , and he replied again with almost a smile .
Captain Wentworth	They talked for a few minutes more ; the improvement held ; he even looked down towards the bench , as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying ; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round .
Captain Wentworth	A few minutes , though as few as possible , were inevitably consumed ; and when her own mistress again , when able to turn and look as she had done before , she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth , in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell .
Captain Wentworth	""" He must wish her good night ; he was going ; he should get home as fast as he could ."
Captain Wentworth	""" No ! "" he replied impressively , "" there is nothing worth my staying for ; "" and he was gone directly ."
Captain Wentworth	Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection !
Captain Wentworth	How was the truth to reach him ?
Captain Wentworth	How , in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations , would he ever learn of her real sentiments ?
Captain Wentworth	How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case , was not worth enquiry ; for there was a Captain Wentworth ; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad , her affection would be his for ever .
Captain Wentworth	How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case , was not worth enquiry ; for there was a Captain Wentworth ; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad , her affection would be his for ever .
Captain Wentworth	"She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend 's penetration , unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her . After another short silence-- "" Pray , "" said Mrs Smith , "" is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ? Does he know that I am in Bath ?"
Captain Wentworth	He stood as opposed to Captain Wentworth , in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness ; and the evil of his attentions last night , the irremediable mischief he might have done , was considered with sensations unqualified , unperplexed .
Captain Wentworth	I should never be out if they were all Sophys , or something of that sort . Well , this Miss Louisa , we all thought , you know , was to marry Frederick . He was courting her week after week .
Captain Wentworth	Instead of staying at Lyme , he went off to Plymouth , and then he went off to see Edward .
Captain Wentworth	When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward 's , and there he has been ever since .
Captain Wentworth	We have seen nothing of him since November .
Captain Wentworth	But now , the matter has take the strangest turn of all ; for this young lady , the same Miss Musgrove , instead of being to marry Frederick , is to marry James Benwick .
Captain Wentworth	"An excellent , good - hearted fellow , I assure you ; a very active , zealous officer too , which is more than you would think for , perhaps , for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice . """
Captain Wentworth	, Sophy and I can not help thinking Frederick 's manners better than his .
Captain Wentworth	"There is something about Frederick more to our taste . "" Anne was caught ."
Captain Wentworth	We have it from Frederick himself .
Captain Wentworth	His sister had a letter from him yesterday , in which he tells us of it , and he had just had it in a letter from Harville , written upon the spot , from Uppercross .
Captain Wentworth	It did seem , last autumn , as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove ; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally , and without violence .
Captain Wentworth	"I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill - used man . "" "" Not at all , not at all ; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end . "" Anne looked down to hide her smile . "" No , no ; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that ."
Captain Wentworth	""" Poor Frederick ! "" said he at last ."
Captain Wentworth	""" Now he must begin all over again with somebody else ."
Captain Wentworth	I think we must get him to Bath .
Captain Wentworth	Sophy must write , and beg him to come to Bath .
Captain Wentworth	"Do not you think , Miss Elliot , we had better try to get him to Bath ? """
Captain Wentworth	19 While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne , and expressing his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath , Captain Wentworth was already on his way thither .
Captain Wentworth	Before Mrs Croft had written , he was arrived , and the very next time Anne walked out , she saw him .
Captain Wentworth	It was fixed accordingly , that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the carriage ; and they had just reached this point , when Anne , as she sat near the window , descried , most decidedly and distinctly , Captain Wentworth walking down the street .
Captain Wentworth	Captain Wentworth must be out of sight .
Captain Wentworth	She was sent back , however , in a moment by the entrance of Captain Wentworth himself , among a party of gentlemen and ladies , evidently his acquaintance , and whom he must have joined a little below Milsom Street .
Captain Wentworth	He was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before ; he looked quite red .
Captain Wentworth	She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments .
Captain Wentworth	He spoke to her , and then turned away .
Captain Wentworth	The character of his manner was embarrassment .
Captain Wentworth	She could not have called it either cold or friendly , or anything so certainly as embarrassed . After a short interval , however , he came towards her , and spoke again .
Captain Wentworth	Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed : neither of them , probably , much the wiser for what they heard , and Anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly .
Captain Wentworth	They had by dint of being so very much together , got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness ; but he could not do it now .
Captain Wentworth	Time had changed him , or Louisa had changed him .
Captain Wentworth	He looked very well , not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits , and he talked of Uppercross , of the Musgroves , nay , even of Louisa , and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her ; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable , not easy , not able to feign that he was . It did not surprise , but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him .
Captain Wentworth	She saw that he saw Elizabeth , that Elizabeth saw him , that there was complete internal recognition on each side ; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance , expecting it , and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness .
Captain Wentworth	At last Miss Elliot and her friend , unattended but by the servant , ( for there was no cousin returned ) , were walking off ; and Captain Wentworth , watching them , turned again to Anne , and by manner , rather than words , was offering his services to her .
Captain Wentworth	""" I am much obliged to you , "" was her answer , "" but I am not going with them . The carriage would not accommodate so many ."
Captain Wentworth	"very little , Nothing that I regard . """
Captain Wentworth	"After a moment 's pause he said : "" Though I came only yesterday , I have equipped myself properly for Bath already , you see , "" ( pointing to a new umbrella ) ; "" I wish you would make use of it , if you are determined to walk ; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair . "" She was very much obliged to him , but declined it all , repeating her conviction , that the rain would come to nothing at present , and adding , "" I am only waiting for Mr Elliot ."
Captain Wentworth	Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly .
Captain Wentworth	"There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme , admiring Anne as she passed , except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend . He came in with eagerness , appeared to see and think only of her , apologised for his stay , was grieved to have kept her waiting , and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased ; and in another moment they walked off together , her arm under his , a gentle and embarrassed glance , and a "" Good morning to you ! "" being all that she had time for , as she passed away ."
Captain Wentworth	As soon as they were out of sight , the ladies of Captain Wentworth 's party began talking of them .
Captain Wentworth	It is not the fashion to say so , but I confess I admire her more than her sister .
Captain Wentworth	""" And so do I. No comparison ."
Captain Wentworth	She had never found it so difficult to listen to him , though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care , and though his subjects were principally such as were wo nt to be always interesting : praise , warm , just , and discriminating , of Lady Russell , and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay .
Captain Wentworth	But just now she could think only of Captain Wentworth .
Captain Wentworth	She could not understand his present feelings , whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not ; and till that point were settled , she could not be quite herself .
Captain Wentworth	alas ! she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet . Another circumstance very essential for her to know , was how long he meant to be in Bath ; he had not mentioned it , or she could not recollect it . He might be only passing through . But it was more probable that he should be come to stay .
Captain Wentworth	In that case , so liable as every body was to meet every body in Bath , Lady Russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere .
Captain Wentworth	Would she recollect him ?
Captain Wentworth	It had cost her something to encounter Lady Russell 's surprise ; and now , if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth , her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him .
Captain Wentworth	The following morning Anne was out with her friend , and for the first hour , in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain ; but at last , in returning down Pulteney Street , she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street .
Captain Wentworth	There were many other men about him , many groups walking the same way , but there was no mistaking him .
Captain Wentworth	She looked instinctively at Lady Russell ; but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself .
Captain Wentworth	No , it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite . She looked at her however , from time to time , anxiously ; and when the moment approached which must point him out , though not daring to look again ( for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen ) , she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell 's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him-- of her being , in short , intently observing him .
Captain Wentworth	She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell 's mind , the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes , the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him , and in foreign climes and in active service too , without robbing him of one personal grace ! At last , Lady Russell drew back her head .
Captain Wentworth	""" Now , how would she speak of him ? """
Captain Wentworth	Anne sighed and blushed and smiled , in pity and disdain , either at her friend or herself . The part which provoked her most , was that in all this waste of foresight and caution , she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them .
Captain Wentworth	The theatre or the rooms , where he was most likely to be , were not fashionable enough for the Elliots , whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties , in which they were getting more and more engaged ; and Anne , wearied of such a state of stagnation , sick of knowing nothing , and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried , was quite impatient for the concert evening .
Captain Wentworth	It was really expected to be a good one , and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music . If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again , she fancied she should be satisfied ; and as to the power of addressing him , she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred .
Captain Wentworth	Elizabeth had turned from him , Lady Russell overlooked him ; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances ; she felt that she owed him attention .
Captain Wentworth	The party before her were , Mrs Musgrove , talking to Mrs Croft , and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth ; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta , too impatient to wait , had gone out the moment it had cleared , but would be back again soon , and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned . She had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed . There was no delay , no waste of time .
Captain Wentworth	"She was deep in the happiness of such misery , or the misery of such happiness , instantly . Two minutes after her entering the room , Captain Wentworth said-- "" We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials . "" Materials were at hand , on a separate table ; he went to it , and nearly turning his back to them all , was engrossed by writing . Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter 's engagement , and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper ."
Captain Wentworth	She felt its application to herself , felt it in a nervous thrill all over her ; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table , Captain Wentworth 's pen ceased to move , his head was raised , pausing , listening , and he turned round the next instant to give a look , one quick , conscious look at her . The two ladies continued to talk , to re - urge the same admitted truths , and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation , but Anne heard nothing distinctly ; it was only a buzz of words in her ear , her mind was in confusion . Captain Harville , who had in truth been hearing none of it , now left his seat , and moved to a window , and Anne seeming to watch him , though it was from thorough absence of mind , became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood .
Captain Wentworth	"The window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting , and though nearer to Captain Wentworth 's table , not very near . As she joined him , Captain Harville 's countenance re - assumed the serious , thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character . "" Look here , "" said he , unfolding a parcel in his hand , and displaying a small miniature painting , "" do you know who that is ?"
Captain Wentworth	Miss Elliot , do you remember our walking together at Lyme , and grieving for him ?
Captain Wentworth	He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape , and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister , sat to him , and was bringing it home for her ; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another !
Captain Wentworth	"He undertakes it ; "" ( looking towards Captain Wentworth , ) "" he is writing about it now . """
Captain Wentworth	she would not have forgotten him so soon !
Captain Wentworth	She doted on him .
Captain Wentworth	"It would be hard , indeed "" ( with a faltering voice ) , "" if woman 's feelings were to be added to all this . "" "" We shall never agree upon this question , "" Captain Harville was beginning to say , when a slight noise called their attention to Captain Wentworth 's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room ."
Captain Wentworth	It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down ; but Anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed , and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them , striving to catch sounds , which yet she did not think he could have caught .
Captain Wentworth	"To - night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party , "" ( turning to Anne . ) "" We had your sister 's card yesterday , and I understood Frederick had a card too , though I did not see it ; and you are disengaged , Frederick , are you not , as well as ourselves ? "" Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste , and either could not or would not answer fully ."
Captain Wentworth	""" Yes , "" said he , "" very true ; here we separate , but Harville and I shall soon be after you ; that is , Harville , if you are ready , I am in half a minute ."
Captain Wentworth	I know you will not be sorry to be off .
Captain Wentworth	"I shall be at your service in half a minute . """
Captain Wentworth	Mrs Croft left them , and Captain Wentworth , having sealed his letter with great rapidity , was indeed ready , and had even a hurried , agitated air , which shewed impatience to be gone .
Captain Wentworth	To lose the possibility of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet , solitary progress up the town ( and she felt almost certain of meeting him ) could not be borne .
Captain Wentworth	I am afraid there had been some mistake ; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth , that we hope to see them both .
Captain Wentworth	Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged , I 'll answer for it ; and Captain Wentworth the same , I dare say .
Captain Wentworth	They were on Union Street , when a quicker step behind , a something of familiar sound , gave her two moments ' preparation for the sight of Captain Wentworth .
Captain Wentworth	He joined them ; but , as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on , said nothing , only looked .
Captain Wentworth	He walked by her side .
Captain Wentworth	"Presently , struck by a sudden thought , Charles said-- "" Captain Wentworth , which way are you going ?"
Captain Wentworth	""" "" I hardly know , "" replied Captain Wentworth , surprised ."
Captain Wentworth	Because , if you are , I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place , and give Anne your arm to her father 's door .
Captain Wentworth	She is rather done for this morning , and must not go so far without help , and I ought to be at that fellow 's in the Market Place .
Captain Wentworth	He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off ; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment , that I might see it ; and if I do not turn back now , I have no chance .
Captain Wentworth	"By his description , a good deal like the second size double - barrel of mine , which you shot with one day round Winthrop . """
Captain Wentworth	She had not mistaken him .
Captain Wentworth	She cared not for Mrs Clay , and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister . With the Musgroves , there was the happy chat of perfect ease ; with Captain Harville , the kind - hearted intercourse of brother and sister ; with Lady Russell , attempts at conversation , which a delicious consciousness cut short ; with Admiral and Mrs Croft , everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest , which the same consciousness sought to conceal ; and with Captain Wentworth , some moments of communications continually occurring , and always the hope of more , and always the knowledge of his being there .
Captain Wentworth	24 Who can be in doubt of what followed ? When any two young people take it into their heads to marry , they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point , be they ever so poor , or ever so imprudent , or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other 's ultimate comfort . This may be bad morality to conclude with , but I believe it to be truth ; and if such parties succeed , how should a Captain Wentworth and an Anne Elliot , with the advantage of maturity of mind , consciousness of right , and one independent fortune between them , fail of bearing down every opposition ? They might in fact , have borne down a great deal more than they met with , for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth .
Captain Wentworth	Captain Wentworth , with five - and - twenty thousand pounds , and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him , was no longer nobody . He was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish , spendthrift baronet , who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which Providence had placed him , and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter .
Captain Wentworth	Sir Walter , indeed , though he had no affection for Anne , and no vanity flattered , to make him really happy on the occasion , was very far from thinking it a bad match for her . On the contrary , when he saw more of Captain Wentworth , saw him repeatedly by daylight , and eyed him well , he was very much struck by his personal claims , and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank ; and all this , assisted by his well - sounding name , enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen , with a very good grace , for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour .
Captain Wentworth	Anne knew that Lady Russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot , and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with , and do justice to Captain Wentworth .
Captain Wentworth	This however was what Lady Russell had now to do . She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both ; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each ; that because Captain Wentworth 's manners had not suited her own ideas , she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity ; and that because Mr Elliot 's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness , their general politeness and suavity , she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well - regulated mind .
Captain Wentworth	There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do , than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong , and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes . There is a quickness of perception in some , a nicety in the discernment of character , a natural penetration , in short , which no experience in others can equal , and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend .
Captain Wentworth	But she was a very good woman , and if her second object was to be sensible and well - judging , her first was to see Anne happy . She loved Anne better than she loved her own abilities ; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over , found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child .
Captain Wentworth	It was creditable to have a sister married , and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion , by keeping Anne with her in the autumn ; and as her own sister must be better than her husband 's sisters , it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter .
Captain Wentworth	Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her , no landed estate , no headship of a family ; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet , she would not change situations with Anne .
Captain Wentworth	Anne , satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell 's meaning to love Captain Wentworth as she ought , had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value .
Captain Wentworth	The disproportion in their fortune was nothing ; it did not give her a moment 's regret ; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly , nothing of respectability , of harmony , of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters , was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity .
Captain Wentworth	She had but two friends in the world to add to his list , Lady Russell and Mrs Smith .
Captain Wentworth	To those , however , he was very well disposed to attach himself .
Captain Wentworth	Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for Mrs Smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently .
Captain Wentworth	She was their earliest visitor in their settled life ; and Captain Wentworth , by putting her in the way of recovering her husband 's property in the West Indies , by writing for her , acting for her , and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend , fully requited the services which she had rendered , or ever meant to render , to his wife .
Captain Wentworth	She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy , and yet be happy . Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits , as her friend Anne 's was in the warmth of her heart . Anne was tenderness itself , and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth 's affection .
Captain Wentworth	His profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less , the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine .
Captain Wentworth	From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the same circle .
Captain Wentworth	Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof ; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each ; they could not but be reverted to ; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him , in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth .
Captain Wentworth	"His profession qualified him , his disposition lead him , to talk ; and "" That was in the year six ; "" "" That happened before I went to sea in the year six , "" occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together : and though his voice did not falter , and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke , Anne felt the utter impossibility , from her knowledge of his mind , that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself ."
Captain Wentworth	When he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind .
Captain Wentworth	"There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party ; and he was very much questioned , and especially by the two Miss Musgroves , who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him , as to the manner of living on board , daily regulations , food , hours , & c. , and their surprise at his accounts , at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable , drew from him some pleasant ridicule , which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant , and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat , or any cook to dress it if there were , or any servant to wait , or any knife and fork to use . From thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Musgrove 's who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying-- "" Ah !"
Captain Wentworth	When she could let her attention take its natural course again , she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List ( their own navy list , the first that had ever been at Uppercross ) , and sitting down together to pore over it , with the professed view of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded .
Captain Wentworth	I was the last man who commanded her . Hardly fit for service then . Reported fit for home service for a year or two , and so I was sent off to the West Indies .
Captain Wentworth	""" The Admiralty , "" he continued , "" entertain themselves now and then , with sending a few hundred men to sea , in a ship not fit to be employed ."
Captain Wentworth	""" "" I felt my luck , Admiral , I assure you ; "" replied Captain Wentworth , seriously ."
Captain Wentworth	""" I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire ."
Captain Wentworth	"It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea ; a very great object , I wanted to be doing something . "" "" To be sure you did . What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together ?"
Captain Wentworth	""" But , Captain Wentworth , "" cried Louisa , "" how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp , to see what an old thing they had given you ."
Captain Wentworth	""" "" I knew pretty well what she was before that day ; "" said he , smiling . """
Captain Wentworth	I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse , which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember , and which at last , on some very wet day , is lent to yourself .
Captain Wentworth	she was a dear old Asp to me .
Captain Wentworth	She did all that I wanted .
Captain Wentworth	I knew she would .
Captain Wentworth	I knew that we should either go to the bottom together , or that she would be the making of me ; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her ; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining , I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn , to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted .
Captain Wentworth	I brought her into Plymouth ; and here another instance of luck .
Captain Wentworth	"We had not been six hours in the Sound , when a gale came on , which lasted four days and nights , and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time ; our touch with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition . Four - and - twenty hours later , and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth , in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers ; and being lost in only a sloop , nobody would have thought about me . """
Captain Wentworth	""" And so then , I suppose , "" said Mrs Musgrove , in a low voice , as if thinking aloud , "" so then he went away to the Laconia , and there he met with our poor boy ."
Captain Wentworth	"Charles , my dear , "" ( beckoning him to her ) , "" do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother ."
Captain Wentworth	Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar , with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth .
Captain Wentworth	"but , Charles , tell Captain Wentworth , he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me , for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend . """
Captain Wentworth	The girls were now hunting for the Laconia ; and Captain Wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble , and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate , and present non - commissioned class , observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had .
Captain Wentworth	those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia !
Captain Wentworth	How fast I made money in her .
Captain Wentworth	A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands .
Captain Wentworth	You know how much he wanted money : worse than myself .
Captain Wentworth	I shall never forget his happiness . He felt it all , so much for her sake .
Captain Wentworth	I wished for him again the next summer , when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean .
Captain Wentworth	""" And I am sure , Sir . "" said Mrs Musgrove , "" it was a lucky day for us , when you were put captain into that ship ."
Captain Wentworth	"We shall never forget what you did . "" Her feelings made her speak low ; and Captain Wentworth , hearing only in part , and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts , looked rather in suspense , and as if waiting for more ."
Captain Wentworth	""" Poor dear fellow ! "" continued Mrs Musgrove ; "" he was grown so steady , and such an excellent correspondent , while he was under your care ! Ah !"
Captain Wentworth	it would have been a happy thing , if he had never left you .
Captain Wentworth	"I assure you , Captain Wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you . "" There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth 's face at this speech , a certain glance of his bright eye , and curl of his handsome mouth , which convinced Anne , that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove 's kind wishes , as to her son , he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him ; but it was too transient an indulgence of self - amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself ; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious , and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa , on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting , took a place by the latter , and entered into conversation with her , in a low voice , about her son , doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace , as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent 's feelings . They were actually on the same sofa , for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him ; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove ."
Captain Wentworth	Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable , substantial size , infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour , than tenderness and sentiment ; and while the agitations of Anne 's slender form , and pensive face , may be considered as very completely screened , Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self - command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son , whom alive nobody had cared for . Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions .
Captain Wentworth	The Admiral , after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him , being called to order by his wife , now came up to Captain Wentworth , and without any observation of what he might be interrupting , thinking only of his own thoughts , began with--
Captain Wentworth	""" If you had been a week later at Lisbon , last spring , Frederick , you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her daughters ."
Captain Wentworth	""" Should I ?"
Captain Wentworth	"I am glad I was not a week later then . "" The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry ."
Captain Wentworth	He defended himself ; though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his , excepting for a ball , or a visit , which a few hours might comprehend .
Captain Wentworth	""" But , if I know myself , "" said he , "" this is from no want of gallantry towards them ."
Captain Wentworth	There can be no want of gallantry , Admiral , in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high , and this is what I do .
Captain Wentworth	I hate to hear of women on board , or to see them on board ; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere , if I can help it .
Captain Wentworth	""" This brought his sister upon him ."
Captain Wentworth	Frederick !
Captain Wentworth	But I can not believe it of you .
Captain Wentworth	""" Nothing to the purpose , "" replied her brother ."
Captain Wentworth	""" You were living with your husband , and were the only woman on board . "" "" But you , yourself , brought Mrs Harville , her sister , her cousin , and three children , round from Portsmouth to Plymouth ."
Captain Wentworth	"Where was this superfine , extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then ? "" "" All merged in my friendship , Sophia ."
Captain Wentworth	I would assist any brother officer 's wife that I could , and I would bring anything of Harville 's from the world 's end , if he wanted it .
Captain Wentworth	"But do not imagine that I did not feel it an evil in itself . "" "" Depend upon it , they were all perfectly comfortable . "" "" I might not like them the better for that perhaps ."
Captain Wentworth	"Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board . "" "" My dear Frederick , you are talking quite idly ."
Captain Wentworth	Pray , what would become of us poor sailors ' wives , who often want to be conveyed to one port or another , after our husbands , if everybody had your feelings ?
Captain Wentworth	""" My feelings , you see , did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all her family to Plymouth ."
Captain Wentworth	""" "" But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman , and as if women were all fine ladies , instead of rational creatures ."
Captain Wentworth	my
Captain Wentworth	", "" said the Admiral , "" when he had got a wife , he will sing a different tune ."
Captain Wentworth	When he is married , if we have the good luck to live to another war , we shall see him do as you and I , and a great many others , have done . We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife .
Captain Wentworth	""" Now I have done , "" cried Captain Wentworth ."
Captain Wentworth	""" When once married people begin to attack me with,--`Oh ! you will think very differently , when you are married . ' I can only say , ` No , I shall not ; ' and then they say again , ` Yes , you will , ' and there is an end of it . "" He got up and moved away ."
Captain Wentworth	""" Pretty well , ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage ; though many women have done more ."
Captain Wentworth	I have crossed the Atlantic four times , and have been once to the East Indies , and back again , and only once ; besides being in different places about home : Cork , and Lisbon , and Gibraltar . But I never went beyond the Streights , and never was in the West Indies .
Captain Wentworth	A little disordered always the first twenty - four hours of going to sea , but never knew what sickness was afterwards . The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind , the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell , or had any ideas of danger , was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal , when the Admiral ( Captain Croft then ) was in the North Seas .
Captain Wentworth	It was a merry , joyous party , and no one seemed in higher spirits than Captain Wentworth . She felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference , and especially the attention of all the young women , could do .
Captain Wentworth	The Miss Hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for Henrietta and Louisa , they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good - will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals . If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ? These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne , while her fingers were mechanically at work , proceeding for half an hour together , equally without error , and without consciousness . Once she felt that he was looking at herself , observing her altered features , perhaps , trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him ; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her ; she was hardly aware of it , till she heard the answer ; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced ?
Captain Wentworth	Once , too , he spoke to her .
Captain Wentworth	She had left the instrument on the dancing being over , and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of .
Captain Wentworth	"Unintentionally she returned to that part of the room ; he saw her , and , instantly rising , said , with studied politeness-- "" I beg your pardon , madam , this is your seat ; "" and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative , he was not to be induced to sit down again . Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches ."
Captain Wentworth	His cold politeness , his ceremonious grace , were worse than anything .
Captain Wentworth	Anne was amused by Henrietta 's manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta 's views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them .
Captain Wentworth	"Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it . He gave her a momentary glance , a glance of brightness , which seemed to say , "" That man is struck with you , and even I , at this moment , see something like Anne Elliot again . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Ah ! "" cried Captain Wentworth , instantly , and with half a glance at Anne , "" it is the very man we passed . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Pray , "" said Captain Wentworth , immediately , "" can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away ? """
Captain Wentworth	""" Yes , Sir , a Mr Elliot , a gentleman of large fortune , came in last night from Sidmouth ."
Captain Wentworth	Dare say you heard the carriage , sir , while you were at dinner ; and going on now for Crewkherne , in his way to Bath and London .
Captain Wentworth	"Pray sir , "" turning to the waiter , "" did not you hear , did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynch family ?"
Captain Wentworth	""" Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together , "" said Captain Wentworth , "" we must consider it to be the arrangement of Providence , that you should not be introduced to your cousin . """
Captain Wentworth	Breakfast had not been long over , when they were joined by Captain and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick ; with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme . They ought to be setting off for Uppercross by one , and in the mean while were to be all together , and out of doors as long as they could .
Captain Wentworth	"Nobody could do it , but that good fellow "" ( pointing to Captain Wentworth . ) "" The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before ; no danger of her being sent to sea again ."
Captain Wentworth	so with all the kind leave - taking , and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined , they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door , and still accompanied by Captain Benwick , who seemed to cling to them to the last , proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb .
Captain Wentworth	and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight , excepting Louisa ; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth .
Captain Wentworth	In all their walks , he had had to jump her from the stiles ; the sensation was delightful to her .
Captain Wentworth	The hardness of the pavement for her feet , made him less willing upon the present occasion ; he did it , however .
Captain Wentworth	"He advised her against it , thought the jar too great ; but no , he reasoned and talked in vain , she smiled and said , "" I am determined I will : """
Captain Wentworth	he put out his hands ; she was too precipitate by half a second , she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb , and was taken up lifeless ! There was no wound , no blood , no visible bruise ; but her eyes were closed , she breathed not , her face was like death . The horror of the moment to all who stood around !
Captain Wentworth	Captain Wentworth , who had caught her up , knelt with her in his arms , looking on her with a face as pallid as her own , in an agony of silence .
Captain Wentworth	"she is dead ! "" screamed Mary , catching hold of her husband , and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable ; and in another moment , Henrietta , sinking under the conviction , lost her senses too , and would have fallen on the steps , but for Captain Benwick and Anne , who caught and supported her between them ."
Captain Wentworth	""" Is there no one to help me ? "" were the first words which burst from Captain Wentworth , in a tone of despair , and as if all his own strength were gone ."
Captain Wentworth	""" Captain Benwick obeyed , and Charles at the same moment , disengaging himself from his wife , they were both with him ; and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them , and everything was done that Anne had prompted , but in vain ;"
Captain Wentworth	"while Captain Wentworth , staggering against the wall for his support , exclaimed in the bitterest agony-- "" Oh God ! her father and mother ! """
Captain Wentworth	"He caught the word ; it seemed to rouse him at once , and saying only-- "" True , true , a surgeon this instant , "" was darting away , when Anne eagerly suggested-- "" Captain Benwick , would not it be better for Captain Benwick ? He knows where a surgeon is to be found . "" Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea , and in a moment ( it was all done in rapid moments ) Captain Benwick had resigned the poor corpse - like figure entirely to the brother 's care , and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity ."
Captain Wentworth	As to the wretched party left behind , it could scarcely be said which of the three , who were completely rational , was suffering most : Captain Wentworth , Anne , or Charles , who , really a very affectionate brother , hung over Louisa with sobs of grief , and could only turn his eyes from one sister , to see the other in a state as insensible , or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife , calling on him
Captain Wentworth	Anne , attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to Henrietta , still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet Mary , to animate Charles , to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth .
Captain Wentworth	"Captain Wentworth 's eyes were also turned towards her . "" Had not she better be carried to the inn ?"
Captain Wentworth	"Yes , I am sure : carry her gently to the inn . "" "" Yes , yes , to the inn , "" repeated Captain Wentworth , comparatively collected , and eager to be doing something ."
Captain Wentworth	""" I will carry her myself ."
Captain Wentworth	They were not off the Cobb , before the Harvilles met them . Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house , with a countenance which showed something to be wrong ; and they had set off immediately , informed and directed as they passed , towards the spot .
Captain Wentworth	The head had received a severe contusion , but he had seen greater injuries recovered from : he was by no means hopeless ; he spoke cheerfully .
Captain Wentworth	That he did not regard it as a desperate case , that he did not say a few hours must end it , was at first felt , beyond the hope of most ; and the ecstasy of such a reprieve , the rejoicing , deep and silent , after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered , may be conceived .
Captain Wentworth	"The tone , the look , with which "" Thank God ! "" was uttered by Captain Wentworth , Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her ; nor the sight of him afterwards , as he sat near a table , leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed , as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul , and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them ."
Captain Wentworth	Captain Benwick must give up his room to them , and get another bed elsewhere ; and the whole was settled .
Captain Wentworth	Charles , Henrietta , and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation , and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror .
Captain Wentworth	"Uppercross , the necessity of some one 's going to Uppercross ; the news to be conveyed ; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove ; the lateness of the morning ; an hour already gone since they ought to have been off ; the impossibility of being in tolerable time . "" At first , they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations ; but , after a while , Captain Wentworth , exerting himself , said-- "" We must be decided , and without the loss of another minute . Every minute is valuable ."
Captain Wentworth	Charles agreed , but declared his resolution of not going away . He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would .
Captain Wentworth	""" Then it is settled , Musgrove , "" cried Captain Wentworth , "" that you stay , and that I take care of your sister home ."
Captain Wentworth	But as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist Mrs Harville , I think it need be only one .
Captain Wentworth	The other two warmly agreed with what he said , and she then appeared .
Captain Wentworth	""" You will stay , I am sure ; you will stay and nurse her ; "" cried he , turning to her and speaking with a glow , and yet a gentleness , which seemed almost restoring the past ."
Captain Wentworth	She coloured deeply , and he recollected himself and moved away .
Captain Wentworth	Though it was rather desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay ; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take them back , would be a dreadful extension of suspense ; and Captain Wentworth proposed , and Charles Musgrove agreed , that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn , and leave Mr Musgrove 's carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early , when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa 's night . Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part , and to be soon followed by the two ladies .
Captain Wentworth	Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them , and a chaise and four in waiting , stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street ; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other , the change in his countenance , the astonishment , the expressions begun and suppressed , with which Charles was listened to , made but a mortifying reception of Anne ; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa .
Captain Wentworth	He had handed them both in , and placed himself between them ; and in this manner , under these circumstances , full of astonishment and emotion to Anne , she quitted Lyme .
Captain Wentworth	He was devoted to Henrietta ; always turning towards her ; and when he spoke at all , always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits . In general , his voice and manner were studiously calm .
Captain Wentworth	Once only , when she had been grieving over the last ill - judged , ill - fated walk to the Cobb , bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of , he burst forth , as if wholly overcome--
Captain Wentworth	""" Do n't talk of it , do n't talk of it , "" he cried ."
Captain Wentworth	""" Oh God ! that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment !"
Captain Wentworth	Had I done as I ought ! But so eager and so resolute !
Captain Wentworth	Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now , to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character ; and whether it might not strike him that , like all other qualities of the mind , it should have its proportions and limits . She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character .
Captain Wentworth	It was growing quite dusk , however , before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross , and there had been total silence among them for some time , Henrietta leaning back in the corner , with a shawl over her face , giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep ; when , as they were going up their last hill , Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth .
Captain Wentworth	"In a low , cautious voice , he said : -- "" I have been considering what we had best do ."
Captain Wentworth	I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her , while I go in and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove .
Captain Wentworth	"Do you think this is a good plan ? "" She did : he was satisfied , and said no more . But the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her , as a proof of friendship , and of deference for her judgement , a great pleasure ; and when it became a sort of parting proof , its value did not lessen ."
Captain Wentworth	When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over , and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped , and the daughter all the better for being with them , he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme ; and when the horses were baited , he was off .
Captain Wentworth	The intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger . Every report agreed in Captain Wentworth 's appearing fixed in Lyme .
Captain Wentworth	Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before , when a full account of the whole had burst on her ; but still it must be talked of , she must make enquiries , she must regret the imprudence , lament the result , and Captain Wentworth 's name must be mentioned by both .
Captain Wentworth	She could not speak the name , and look straight forward to Lady Russell 's eye , till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa .
Captain Wentworth	When this was told , his name distressed her no longer .
Captain Wentworth	Lady Russell had only to listen composedly , and wish them happy , but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure , in pleased contempt , that the man who at twenty - three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an Anne Elliot , should , eight years afterwards , be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove .
Captain Wentworth	The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ) , had brought Anne the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more . He had enquired after her , she found , particularly ; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot 's not being the worse for her exertions , and had spoken of those exertions as great . This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done . As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove 's recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter !
Captain Wentworth	"The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming-- "" Ay , a very bad business indeed ."
Captain Wentworth	"This is breaking a head and giving a plaster , truly ! "" Admiral Croft 's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell , but they delighted Anne ."
Captain Wentworth	"His goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible . "" Now , this must be very bad for you , "" said he , suddenly rousing from a little reverie , "" to be coming and finding us here ."
Captain Wentworth	I had not recollected it before , I declare , but it must be very bad .
Captain Wentworth	"Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it . "" "" Another time , Sir , I thank you , not now ."
Captain Wentworth	"But , "" ( checking himself ) , "" you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler 's room ."
Captain Wentworth	Ay , so it always is , I believe .
Captain Wentworth	"We have made very few changes either , "" continued the Admiral , after thinking a moment ."
Captain Wentworth	You will tell Sir Walter what we have done , and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had . Indeed , I must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better . My wife should have the credit of them , however .
Captain Wentworth	I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking - glasses from my dressing - room , which was your father 's .
Captain Wentworth	"A very good man , and very much the gentleman I am sure : but I should think , Miss Elliot , "" ( looking with serious reflection ) , "" I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life ."
Captain Wentworth	So I got Sophy to lend me a hand , and we soon shifted their quarters ; and now I am quite snug , with my little shaving glass in one corner , and another great thing that I never go near .
Captain Wentworth	"Anne , amused in spite of herself , was rather distressed for an answer , and the Admiral , fearing he might not have been civil enough , took up the subject again , to say-- "" The next time you write to your good father , Miss Elliot , pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft 's , and say that we are settled here quite to our liking , and have no fault at all to find with the place ."
Captain Wentworth	The breakfast - room chimney smokes a little , I grant you , but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard , which may not happen three times a winter .
Captain Wentworth	Pray say so , with my compliments .
Captain Wentworth	Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other : but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present ; for when it was returned , the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks , to visit their connexions in the north of the county , and probably might not be at home again before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath . So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall , or of seeing him in company with her friend .
Captain Wentworth	Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home , to stay as long as he liked , being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral 's fraternal kindness as of his wife 's .
Captain Wentworth	He had intended , on first arriving , to proceed very soon into Shropshire , and visit the brother settled in that country , but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off .
Captain Wentworth	There was so much of friendliness , and of flattery , and of everything most bewitching in his reception there ; the old were so hospitable , the young so agreeable , that he could not but resolve to remain where he was , and take all the charms and perfections of Edward 's wife upon credit a little longer .
Captain Wentworth	It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day .
Captain Wentworth	The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come , particularly in the morning , when he had no companion at home , for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together , interesting themselves in their new possessions , their grass , and their sheep , and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person , or driving out in a gig , lately added to their establishment .
Captain Wentworth	Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies . It was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way . Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins , and a very amiable , pleasing young man , between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth 's introduction . He was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father 's house , only two miles from Uppercross .
Captain Wentworth	A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period , and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners , and of seeing Captain Wentworth .
Captain Wentworth	The two families had always been on excellent terms , there being no pride on one side , and no envy on the other , and only such a consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves , as made them pleased to improve their cousins . Charles 's attentions to Henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation .
Captain Wentworth	""" It would not be a great match for her ; but if Henrietta liked him,""-- and Henrietta did seem to like him ."
Captain Wentworth	Henrietta fully thought so herself , before Captain Wentworth came ; but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten .
Captain Wentworth	Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful , as far as Anne 's observation reached .
Captain Wentworth	Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest , Louisa had the higher spirits ; and she knew not now , whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him .
Captain Wentworth	"Mr and Mrs Musgrove , either from seeing little , or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters , and of all the young men who came near them , seemed to leave everything to take its chance . There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion - house ; but it was different at the Cottage : the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder ; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves ' company , and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared , when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister , as to which was the one liked best . Charles gave it for Louisa , Mary for Henrietta , but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful . Charles "" had never seen a pleasanter man in his life ; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say , was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war ."
Captain Wentworth	Here was a fortune at once ; besides which , there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war ; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy .
Captain Wentworth	it would be a capital match for either of his sisters .
Captain Wentworth	""" Dear me ! If he should rise to any very great honours ! If he should ever be made a baronet !"
Captain Wentworth	Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth !
Captain Wentworth	It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very account of Charles Hayter , whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to . She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters , and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed -- very sad for herself and her children .
Captain Wentworth	""" You know , "" said she , "" I can not think him at all a fit match for Henrietta ; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made , she has no right to throw herself away ."
Captain Wentworth	I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family , and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them . And , pray , who is Charles Hayter ?
Captain Wentworth	""" Her husband , however , would not agree with her here ; for besides having a regard for his cousin , Charles Hayter was an eldest son , and he saw things as an eldest son himself . "" Now you are taking nonsense , Mary , "" was therefore his answer ."
Captain Wentworth	""" It would not be a great match for Henrietta , but Charles has"
Captain Wentworth	a very fair chance , through the Spicers , of getting something from the Bishop in the course of a year or two ; and you will please to remember , that he is the eldest son ; whenever my uncle dies , he steps into very pretty property .
Captain Wentworth	The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres , besides the farm near Taunton , which is some of the best land in the country . I grant you , that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta , and indeed it could not be ; he is the only one that could be possible ; but he is a very good - natured , good sort of a fellow ; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands , he will make a different sort of place of it , and live in a very different sort of way ; and with that property , he will never be a contemptible man -- good , freehold property .
Captain Wentworth	"; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter ; and if she has him , and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth , I shall be very well satisfied . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Charles may say what he pleases , "" cried Mary to Anne , as soon as he was out of the room , "" but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter ; a very bad thing for her , and still worse for me ; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head , and I have very little doubt"
Captain Wentworth	that he has .
Captain Wentworth	She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday .
Captain Wentworth	And as to Captain Wentworth 's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta , it is nonsense to say so ; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best .
Captain Wentworth	But Charles is so positive !
Captain Wentworth	"I wish you had been with us yesterday , for then you might have decided between us ; and I am sure you would have thought as I did , unless you had been determined to give it against me . "" A dinner at Mr Musgrove 's had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne ; but she had staid at home , under the mixed plea of a headache of her own , and some return of indisposition in little Charles . She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth ; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening ."
Captain Wentworth	As to Captain Wentworth 's views , she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister , or impeaching his own honour , than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa , or Louisa to Henrietta . Either of them would , in all probability , make him an affectionate , good - humoured wife .
Captain Wentworth	With regard to Charles Hayter , she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well - meaning young woman , and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned ; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings , the alternation could not be understood too soon . Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin 's behaviour . She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause .
Captain Wentworth	He had been absent only two Sundays , and when they parted , had left her interested , even to the height of his wishes , in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy , and obtaining that of Uppercross instead . It had then seemed the object nearest her heart , that Dr Shirley , the rector , who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office , but was now growing too infirm for many of them , should be quite fixed on engaging a curate ; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford , and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it . The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross , instead of going six miles another way ; of his having , in every respect , a better curacy ; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley , and of dear , good Dr Shirley 's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue , had been a great deal , even to Louisa , but had been almost everything to Henrietta . When he came back , alas !
Captain Wentworth	"Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley : she was at a window , looking out for Captain Wentworth ; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give , and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation . """
Captain Wentworth	"It did not appear to me that -- in short , you know , Dr Shirley must have a curate , and you had secured his promise . Is he coming , Louisa ? """
Captain Wentworth	One morning , very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves , at which Anne had not been present , Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing - room at the Cottage , where were only herself and the little invalid Charles , who was lying on the sofa .
Captain Wentworth	"The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot , deprived his manners of their usual composure : he started , and could only say , "" I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here : Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here , "" before he walked to the window to recollect himself , and feel how he ought to behave . "" They are up stairs with my sister : they will be down in a few moments , I dare say , "" had been Anne 's reply , in all the confusion that was natural ; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him , she would have been out of the room the next moment , and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself ."
Captain Wentworth	"He continued at the window ; and after calmly and politely saying , "" I hope the little boy is better , "" was silent ."
Captain Wentworth	She hoped , on turning her head , to see the master of the house ; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy -- Charles Hayter , probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne .
Captain Wentworth	"She only attempted to say , "" How do you do ?"
Captain Wentworth	Will you not sit down ?
Captain Wentworth	"The others will be here presently . "" Captain Wentworth , however , came from his window , apparently not ill - disposed for conversation ; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table , and taking up the newspaper ; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window ."
Captain Wentworth	"There being nothing to eat , he could only have some play ; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother , he began to fasten himself upon her , as she knelt , in such a way that , busy as she was about Charles , she could not shake him off . She spoke to him , ordered , entreated , and insisted in vain . Once she did contrive to push him away , but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly . "" Walter , "" said she , "" get down this moment ."
Captain Wentworth	You are extremely troublesome .
Captain Wentworth	"I am very angry with you . "" "" Walter , "" cried Charles Hayter , "" why do you not do as you are bid ?"
Captain Wentworth	Do not you hear your aunt speak ?
Captain Wentworth	"Come to me , Walter , come to cousin Charles . "" But not a bit did Walter stir ."
Captain Wentworth	In another moment , however , she found herself in the state of being released from him ; some one was taking him from her , though he had bent down her head so much , that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck , and he was resolutely borne away , before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it .
Captain Wentworth	Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless . She could not even thank him . She could only hang over little Charles , with most disordered feelings .
Captain Wentworth	It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth .
Captain Wentworth	"She had a strong impression of his having said , in a vext tone of voice , after Captain Wentworth 's interference , "" You ought to have minded me , Walter ; I told you not to teaze your aunt ; "" and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself ."
Captain Wentworth	But neither Charles Hayter 's feelings , nor anybody 's feelings , could interest her , till she had a little better arranged her own . She was ashamed of herself , quite ashamed of being so nervous , so overcome by such a trifle ; but so it was , and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her .
Louisa Musgrove	Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion , though too wise to acknowledge as much at home , where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife ; for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite , she could not but think , as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience , that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either .
Louisa Musgrove	Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted , and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them .
Louisa Musgrove	It was Mary 's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from Henrietta , and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to - morrow . Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was wise .
Louisa Musgrove	He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta .
Louisa Musgrove	Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister .
Louisa Musgrove	This distinction appeared to increase , and there was one speech of Louisa 's which struck her .
Louisa Musgrove	"You make the most of it , I know , "" cried Louisa , "" but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place . If I loved a man , as she loves the Admiral , I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else . "" It was spoken with enthusiasm . "" Had you ? "" cried he , catching the same tone ; "" I honour you ! """
Louisa Musgrove	"Well now , I think we had better turn back ; I am excessively tired . "" Henrietta , conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as Mary wished ; but "" No ! "" said Charles Musgrove , and "" No , no ! "" cried Louisa more eagerly , and taking her sister aside , seemed to be arguing the matter warmly ."
Louisa Musgrove	After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations , it was settled between Charles and his two sisters , that he and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes , to see their aunt and cousins , while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill .
Louisa Musgrove	"Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to Henrietta , Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to Captain Wentworth-- "" It is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life . "" She received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of ."
Louisa Musgrove	The brow of the hill , where they remained , was a cheerful spot : Louisa returned ; and Mary , finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile , was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her ; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away , to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge - row , and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound , Mary was happy no longer
Louisa Musgrove	; she quarrelled with her own seat , was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere , and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also . She turned through the same gate , but could not see them .
Louisa Musgrove	Mary sat down for a moment , but it would not do ; she was sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else , and she would go on
Louisa Musgrove	Anne , really tired herself , was glad to sit down ; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge - row , behind her , as if making their way back along the rough , wild sort of channel , down the centre .
Louisa Musgrove	Louisa 's voice was the first distinguished .
Louisa Musgrove	She seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech .
Louisa Musgrove	When I have made up my mind , I have made it ; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to - day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance !
Louisa Musgrove	""" She would have turned back then , but for you ? "" "" She would indeed ."
Louisa Musgrove	""" "" Happy for her , to have such a mind as yours at hand !"
Louisa Musgrove	""" He had done , and was unanswered . It would have surprised Anne if Louisa could have readily answered such a speech : words of such interest , spoken with such serious warmth !"
Louisa Musgrove	She could imagine what Louisa was feeling .
Louisa Musgrove	"While she remained , a bush of low rambling holly protected her , and they were moving on . Before they were beyond her hearing , however , Louisa spoke again . "" Mary is good - natured enough in many respects , "" said she ; "" but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride -- the Elliot pride ."
Louisa Musgrove	I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne ?
Louisa Musgrove	"After a moment 's pause , Captain Wentworth said-- "" Do you mean that she refused him ? """
Louisa Musgrove	""" I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary ."
Louisa Musgrove	I wish she had accepted him . We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell 's doing , that she did not .
Louisa Musgrove	Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give . Charles and Henrietta returned , bringing , as may be conjectured , Charles Hayter with them .
Louisa Musgrove	The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand ; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman 's side , and a relenting on the lady 's , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt . Henrietta looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased;-- Charles Hayter exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross . Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two .
Louisa Musgrove	The invitation was general , and generally declined . The Miss Musgroves were not at all tired , and Mary was either offended , by not being asked before any of the others , or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise .
Louisa Musgrove	Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself , it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross ; though November , the weather was by no means bad ; and , in short , Louisa , who was the most eager of the eager , having formed the resolution to go , and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked , being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way , bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer ; and to Lyme they were to go -- Charles , Mary , Anne , Henrietta , Louisa , and Captain Wentworth .
Louisa Musgrove	They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring ; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long , when they saw him coming after them , with three companions , all well known already , by description , to be Captain and Mrs Harville , and a Captain Benwick , who was staying with them .
Louisa Musgrove	"when they quitted the house ; and Louisa , by whom she found herself walking , burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy ; their friendliness , their brotherliness , their openness , their uprightness ; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England ; that they only knew how to live , and they only deserved to be respected and loved . They went back to dress and dine ; and so well had the scheme answered already , that nothing was found amiss ; though its being "" so entirely out of season , "" and the "" no thoroughfare of Lyme , "" and the "" no expectation of company , "" had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn ."
Louisa Musgrove	I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable , sweet - tempered girl , and not deficient in understanding , but Benwick is something more .
Louisa Musgrove	He is a clever man , a reading man ; and I confess , that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise . Had it been the effect of gratitude , had he learnt to love her , because he believed her to be preferring him , it would have been another thing . But I have no reason to suppose it so .
Louisa Musgrove	Fanny Harville was a very superior creature , and his attachment to her was indeed attachment .
Louisa Musgrove	"A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman . He ought not ; he does not . "" Either from the consciousness , however , that his friend had recovered , or from other consciousness , he went no farther ; and Anne who , in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered , and in spite of all the various noises of the room , the almost ceaseless slam of the door , and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through , had distinguished every word , was struck , gratified , confused , and beginning to breathe very quick , and feel an hundred things in a moment . It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject ; and yet , after a pause , feeling the necessity of speaking , and having not the smallest wish for a total change , she only deviated so far as to say-- "" You were a good while at Lyme , I think ? "" "" About a fortnight . I could not leave it till Louisa 's doing well was quite ascertained ."
Louisa Musgrove	She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak .
Louisa Musgrove	Their interesting , almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time , but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on ! She had learnt , in the last ten minutes , more of his feelings towards Louisa , more of all his feelings than she dared to think of ; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party , to the needful civilities of the moment , with exquisite , though agitated sensations .
Louisa Musgrove	His opinion of Louisa Musgrove 's inferiority , an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give , his wonder at Captain Benwick , his feelings as to a first , strong attachment ; sentences begun which he could not finish , his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance , all , all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least ; that anger , resentment , avoidance , were no more ; and that they were succeeded , not merely by friendship and regard , but by the tenderness of the past . Yes , some share of the tenderness of the past . She could not contemplate the change as implying less .
Louisa Musgrove	14 Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge . They had left Louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them . They had been all in lodgings together .
Louisa Musgrove	As Louisa improved , he had improved , and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week .
Louisa Musgrove	He had not seen Louisa ; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview , that he did not press for it at all ; and , on the contrary , seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days , till her head was stronger .
Louisa Musgrove	Henrietta remained with Louisa ; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters .
Louisa Musgrove	Though neither Henrietta , nor Louisa , nor Charles Hayter , nor Captain Wentworth were there , the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in .
Louisa Musgrove	Anne , judging from her own temperament , would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves , which Louisa 's illness must have so greatly shaken .
Louisa Musgrove	Louisa was now recovering apace .
Louisa Musgrove	Her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home , before her brothers and sisters went to school again .
Louisa Musgrove	Mrs Harville , her children , and Captain Benwick , remained with Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross .
Louisa Musgrove	Anne 's only surprise was , that affairs should be in forwardness enough for Henrietta 's wedding - clothes to be talked of . She had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand ; but she learned from Charles that , very recently , ( since Mary 's last letter to herself ) , Charles Hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years ; and that on the strength of his present income , with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question , the two families had consented to the young people 's wishes , and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months , quite as soon as Louisa 's .
Louisa Musgrove	"Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ? "" He answered rather hesitatingly , "" Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different . If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab - chick in the water ; and Benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long ."
Louisa Musgrove	It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on Charles 's leaving them together , was listening to Mrs Musgrove 's history of Louisa , and to Henrietta 's of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which Mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill - used by anybody ; which Mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining .
Louisa Musgrove	It was three weeks since she had heard at all . She only knew that Henrietta was at home again ; and that Louisa , though considered to be recovering fast , was still in Lyme ; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening , when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to her ; and , to quicken the pleasure and surprise , with Admiral and Mrs Croft 's compliments .
Louisa Musgrove	Between ourselves , I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa ; it would have kept her a little out of his way .
Louisa Musgrove	The carriage is gone to - day , to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to - morrow .
Louisa Musgrove	I kept my letter open , that I might send you word how Louisa bore her journey , and now I am extremely glad I did , having a great deal to add .
Louisa Musgrove	But now for Louisa .
Louisa Musgrove	She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely , and in the evening we went to ask her how she did , when we were rather surprised not to find
Louisa Musgrove	as well as the Harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa , and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by Captain Harville . True , upon my honour !
Louisa Musgrove	Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter . We are all very well pleased , however , for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth , it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter ; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent , and Captain Benwick is expected to - day
Louisa Musgrove	Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister 's account ; but , however , Louisa is a great favourite with both .
Louisa Musgrove	Indeed , Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her .
Louisa Musgrove	Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say ; but if you remember , I never thought him attached to Louisa ; I never could see anything of it .
Louisa Musgrove	Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove , but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters .
Louisa Musgrove	Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove !
Louisa Musgrove	"Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond . "" How is Mary ? "" said Elizabeth ; and without waiting for an answer ,"
Louisa Musgrove	Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel ! Perhaps he had quitted the field , had given Louisa up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her .
Louisa Musgrove	She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity , or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend .
Louisa Musgrove	She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly . Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove ! The high - spirited , joyous - talking Louisa Musgrove , and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading , Captain Benwick , seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other .
Louisa Musgrove	They had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since Henrietta 's coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and Louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable .
Louisa Musgrove	Louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with , and they would soon grow more alike .
Louisa Musgrove	He would gain cheerfulness , and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron ; nay , that was probably learnt already ; of course they had fallen in love over poetry .
Louisa Musgrove	The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste ,
Louisa Musgrove	The visit of ceremony was paid and returned ; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned , and Captain Benwick , too , without even half a smile .
Louisa Musgrove	But first of all , you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about .
Louisa Musgrove	That young lady , you know , that we have all been so concerned for .
Louisa Musgrove	The Miss Musgrove , that all this has been happening to .
Louisa Musgrove	Her Christian name : I always forget her Christian name .
Louisa Musgrove	"Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did ; but now she could safely suggest the name of "" Louisa ."
Louisa Musgrove	""" Ay , ay , Miss Louisa Musgrove , that is the name ."
Louisa Musgrove	I should never be out if they were all Sophys , or something of that sort . Well , this Miss Louisa , we all thought , you know , was to marry Frederick . He was courting her week after week .
Louisa Musgrove	The only wonder was , what they could be waiting for , till the business at Lyme came ; then , indeed , it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right .
Louisa Musgrove	But now , the matter has take the strangest turn of all ; for this young lady , the same Miss Musgrove , instead of being to marry Frederick , is to marry James Benwick .
Louisa Musgrove	""" "" Well , she is to marry him ."
Louisa Musgrove	It did seem , last autumn , as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove ; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally , and without violence .
Louisa Musgrove	"If the girl likes another man better , it is very fit she should have him . "" "" Certainly ."
Louisa Musgrove	No , you would not guess , from his way of writing , that he had ever thought of this Miss ( what 's her name ? ) for himself . He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together ; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that , I think .
Louisa Musgrove	It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again , for that other Miss Musgrove , I find , is bespoke by her cousin , the young parson .
Louisa Musgrove	Time had changed him , or Louisa had changed him .
Louisa Musgrove	He looked very well , not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits , and he talked of Uppercross , of the Musgroves , nay , even of Louisa , and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her ; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable , not easy , not able to feign that he was . It did not surprise , but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him .
Louisa Musgrove	""" But , Captain Wentworth , "" cried Louisa , "" how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp , to see what an old thing they had given you ."
Louisa Musgrove	I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse , which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember , and which at last , on some very wet day , is lent to yourself .
Louisa Musgrove	Anne was amused by Henrietta 's manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta 's views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them .
Louisa Musgrove	They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready ; but Louisa recollecting , immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop , invited them all to go back with her into the town . They were all at her disposal .
Louisa Musgrove	After attending Louisa through her business , and loitering about a little longer , they returned to the inn ; and Anne , in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining - room , had nearly run against the very same gentleman , as he came out of an adjoining apartment .
Louisa Musgrove	By all their calculations there was just time for this ; but as they drew near the Cobb , there was such a general wish to walk along it once more , all were so inclined , and Louisa soon grew so determined , that the difference of a quarter of an hour , it was found , would be no difference at all ;
Louisa Musgrove	and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight , excepting Louisa ; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth .
Louisa Musgrove	In all their walks , he had had to jump her from the stiles ; the sensation was delightful to her .
Louisa Musgrove	The hardness of the pavement for her feet , made him less willing upon the present occasion ; he did it , however .
Louisa Musgrove	She was safely down , and instantly , to show her enjoyment , ran up the steps to be jumped down again .
Louisa Musgrove	"He advised her against it , thought the jar too great ; but no , he reasoned and talked in vain , she smiled and said , "" I am determined I will : """
Louisa Musgrove	he put out his hands ; she was too precipitate by half a second , she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb , and was taken up lifeless ! There was no wound , no blood , no visible bruise ; but her eyes were closed , she breathed not , her face was like death . The horror of the moment to all who stood around !
Louisa Musgrove	Captain Wentworth , who had caught her up , knelt with her in his arms , looking on her with a face as pallid as her own , in an agony of silence .
Louisa Musgrove	""" She is dead !"
Louisa Musgrove	"she is dead ! "" screamed Mary , catching hold of her husband , and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable ; and in another moment , Henrietta , sinking under the conviction , lost her senses too , and would have fallen on the steps , but for Captain Benwick and Anne , who caught and supported her between them ."
Louisa Musgrove	""" Is there no one to help me ? "" were the first words which burst from Captain Wentworth , in a tone of despair , and as if all his own strength were gone ."
Louisa Musgrove	I can support her myself .
Louisa Musgrove	Rub her hands , rub her temples ; here are salts ; take them , take them .
Louisa Musgrove	""" Captain Benwick obeyed , and Charles at the same moment , disengaging himself from his wife , they were both with him ; and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them , and everything was done that Anne had prompted , but in vain ;"
Louisa Musgrove	"while Captain Wentworth , staggering against the wall for his support , exclaimed in the bitterest agony-- "" Oh God ! her father and mother ! """
Louisa Musgrove	As to the wretched party left behind , it could scarcely be said which of the three , who were completely rational , was suffering most : Captain Wentworth , Anne , or Charles , who , really a very affectionate brother , hung over Louisa with sobs of grief , and could only turn his eyes from one sister , to see the other in a state as insensible , or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife , calling on him
Louisa Musgrove	"Captain Wentworth 's eyes were also turned towards her . "" Had not she better be carried to the inn ?"
Louisa Musgrove	"Yes , I am sure : carry her gently to the inn . "" "" Yes , yes , to the inn , "" repeated Captain Wentworth , comparatively collected , and eager to be doing something ."
Louisa Musgrove	""" I will carry her myself ."
Louisa Musgrove	"Musgrove , take care of the others . "" By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the Cobb , and many were collected near them , to be useful if wanted , at any rate , to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady , nay , two dead young ladies , for it proved twice as fine as the first report ."
Louisa Musgrove	To some of the best - looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned , for , though partially revived , she was quite helpless ; and in this manner , Anne walking by her side , and Charles attending to his wife , they set forward , treading back with feelings unutterable , the ground , which so lately , so very lately , and so light of heart , they had passed along .
Louisa Musgrove	Shocked as Captain Harville was , he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful ; and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done .
Louisa Musgrove	She must be taken to their house ; all must go to their house ; and await the surgeon 's arrival there .
Louisa Musgrove	They would not listen to scruples : he was obeyed ; they were all beneath his roof ; and while Louisa , under Mrs Harville 's direction , was conveyed up stairs , and given possession of her own bed , assistance , cordials , restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them . Louisa had once opened her eyes , but soon closed them again , without apparent consciousness .
Louisa Musgrove	This had been a proof of life , however , of service to her sister ; and Henrietta , though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with Louisa , was kept , by the agitation of hope and fear , from a return of her own insensibility .
Louisa Musgrove	Louisa 's limbs had escaped .
Louisa Musgrove	That Louisa must remain where she was , however distressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble , did not admit a doubt .
Louisa Musgrove	Her removal was impossible .
Louisa Musgrove	"They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more ; and yet perhaps , by "" putting the children away in the maid 's room , or swinging a cot somewhere , "" they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides , supposing they might wish to stay ; though , with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove , there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville 's care entirely ."
Louisa Musgrove	"Uppercross , the necessity of some one 's going to Uppercross ; the news to be conveyed ; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove ; the lateness of the morning ; an hour already gone since they ought to have been off ; the impossibility of being in tolerable time . "" At first , they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations ; but , after a while , Captain Wentworth , exerting himself , said-- "" We must be decided , and without the loss of another minute . Every minute is valuable ."
Louisa Musgrove	Charles agreed , but declared his resolution of not going away . He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would .
Louisa Musgrove	She who had not been able to remain in Louisa 's room , or to look at her , without sufferings which made her worse than helpless !
Louisa Musgrove	The plan had reached this point , when Anne , coming quietly down from Louisa 's room , could not but hear what followed , for the parlour door was open .
Louisa Musgrove	""" Then it is settled , Musgrove , "" cried Captain Wentworth , "" that you stay , and that I take care of your sister home ."
Louisa Musgrove	""" You will stay , I am sure ; you will stay and nurse her ; "" cried he , turning to her and speaking with a glow , and yet a gentleness , which seemed almost restoring the past ."
Louisa Musgrove	""" It was what she had been thinking of , and wishing to be allowed to do ."
Louisa Musgrove	"A bed on the floor in Louisa 's room would be sufficient for her , if Mrs Harville would but think so . "" One thing more , and all seemed arranged ."
Louisa Musgrove	Though it was rather desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay ; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take them back , would be a dreadful extension of suspense ; and Captain Wentworth proposed , and Charles Musgrove agreed , that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn , and leave Mr Musgrove 's carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early , when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa 's night . Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part , and to be soon followed by the two ladies .
Louisa Musgrove	She was so wretched and so vehement , complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of Anne ; Anne , who was nothing to Louisa , while she was her sister , and had the best right to stay in Henrietta 's stead !
Louisa Musgrove	Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of Mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , Charles taking care of his sister , and Captain Benwick attending to her . She gave a moment 's recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . There she had listened to Henrietta 's schemes for Dr Shirley 's leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen Mr Elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa , or those who were wrapt up in her welfare . Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance .
Louisa Musgrove	Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them , and a chaise and four in waiting , stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street ; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other , the change in his countenance , the astonishment , the expressions begun and suppressed , with which Charles was listened to , made but a mortifying reception of Anne ; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa .
Louisa Musgrove	Without emulating the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry , she would have attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard , for his sake ; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend .
Louisa Musgrove	He was devoted to Henrietta ; always turning towards her ; and when he spoke at all , always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits . In general , his voice and manner were studiously calm .
Louisa Musgrove	To spare Henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle .
Louisa Musgrove	""" Oh God ! that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment !"
Louisa Musgrove	It was growing quite dusk , however , before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross , and there had been total silence among them for some time , Henrietta leaning back in the corner , with a shawl over her face , giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep ; when , as they were going up their last hill , Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth .
Louisa Musgrove	She must not appear at first .
Louisa Musgrove	She could not stand it .
Louisa Musgrove	I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her , while I go in and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove .
Louisa Musgrove	When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over , and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped , and the daughter all the better for being with them , he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme ; and when the horses were baited , he was off .
Louisa Musgrove	Louisa was much the same .
Louisa Musgrove	They were indebted , the next day , to Charles Hayter , for all the minute knowledge of Louisa , which it was so essential to obtain every twenty - four hours .
Louisa Musgrove	""" What should they do without her ?"
Louisa Musgrove	She had little difficulty ; it was soon determined that they would go ; go to - morrow , fix themselves at the inn , or get into lodgings , as it suited , and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved .
Louisa Musgrove	They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that Anne was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence . She was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character . A few days had made a change indeed ! If Louisa recovered , it would all be well again .
Louisa Musgrove	There could not be a doubt , to her mind there was none , of what would follow her recovery .
Louisa Musgrove	A few months hence , and the room now so deserted , occupied but by her silent , pensive self , might be filled again with all that was happy and gay , all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love , all that was most unlike Anne Elliot !
Louisa Musgrove	Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father 's house in Camden Place , or her own sister 's intimacy with Mrs Clay . She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her .
Louisa Musgrove	She could not speak the name , and look straight forward to Lady Russell 's eye , till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa .
Louisa Musgrove	"The first three or four days passed most quietly , with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme , which found their way to Anne , she could not tell how , and brought a rather improving account of Louisa . At the end of that period , Lady Russell 's politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self - threatenings of the past became in a decided tone , "" I must call on Mrs Croft ; I really must call upon her soon . Anne , have you courage to go with me , and pay a visit in that house ?"
Louisa Musgrove	Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite , and on the present occasion , receiving her in that house , there was particular attention .
Louisa Musgrove	The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ) , had brought Anne the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more . He had enquired after her , she found , particularly ; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot 's not being the worse for her exertions , and had spoken of those exertions as great . This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done . As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove 's recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter !
Louisa Musgrove	You will tell Sir Walter what we have done , and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had . Indeed , I must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better . My wife should have the credit of them , however .
Louisa Musgrove	"Anne , amused in spite of herself , was rather distressed for an answer , and the Admiral , fearing he might not have been civil enough , took up the subject again , to say-- "" The next time you write to your good father , Miss Elliot , pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft 's , and say that we are settled here quite to our liking , and have no fault at all to find with the place ."
Louisa Musgrove	Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other : but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present ; for when it was returned , the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks , to visit their connexions in the north of the county , and probably might not be at home again before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath . So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall , or of seeing him in company with her friend .
Charles Hayter	Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted , and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them .
Charles Hayter	He had , probably , never heard , and never thought of any claims of Charles Hayter .
Charles Hayter	After a short struggle , however , Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field .
Charles Hayter	Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross ; a most decided change . He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner ; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books before him , Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right , and talked , with grave faces , of his studying himself to death .
Charles Hayter	It was Mary 's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from Henrietta , and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to - morrow . Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was wise .
Charles Hayter	Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give . Charles and Henrietta returned , bringing , as may be conjectured , Charles Hayter with them .
Charles Hayter	The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand ; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman 's side , and a relenting on the lady 's , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt . Henrietta looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased;-- Charles Hayter exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross . Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two .
Charles Hayter	They were indebted , the next day , to Charles Hayter , for all the minute knowledge of Louisa , which it was so essential to obtain every twenty - four hours .
Charles Hayter	He made it his business to go to Lyme , and his account was still encouraging .
Charles Hayter	Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies . It was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way . Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins , and a very amiable , pleasing young man , between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth 's introduction . He was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father 's house , only two miles from Uppercross .
Charles Hayter	Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters .
Charles Hayter	Mr Hayter had some property of his own , but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove 's ; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country , the young Hayters would , from their parents ' inferior , retired , and unpolished way of living , and their own defective education , have been hardly in any class at all , but for their connexion with Uppercross , this eldest son of course excepted , who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman , and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest .
Charles Hayter	"Mr and Mrs Musgrove , either from seeing little , or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters , and of all the young men who came near them , seemed to leave everything to take its chance . There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion - house ; but it was different at the Cottage : the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder ; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves ' company , and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared , when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister , as to which was the one liked best . Charles gave it for Louisa , Mary for Henrietta , but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful . Charles "" had never seen a pleasanter man in his life ; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say , was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war ."
Charles Hayter	"The others will be here presently . "" Captain Wentworth , however , came from his window , apparently not ill - disposed for conversation ; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table , and taking up the newspaper ; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window ."
Mr. Musgrove	Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross ; a most decided change . He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner ; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books before him , Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right , and talked , with grave faces , of his studying himself to death .
Mr. Musgrove	One morning , about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth being gone a - shooting together , as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion - house .
Mr. Musgrove	A very few days more , and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch , and Mr Musgrove had called on him , and come back warm in his praise , and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross , by the end of another week . It had been a great disappointment to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed , so impatient was he to shew his gratitude , by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own roof , and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars . But a week must pass ; only a week , in Anne 's reckoning , and then , she supposed , they must meet ; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week .
Mr. Musgrove	Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove 's civility , and she was all but calling there in the same half hour .
Mr. Musgrove	It was an afternoon of distress , and Anne had every thing to do at once ; the apothecary to send for , the father to have pursued and informed , the mother to support and keep from hysterics , the servants to control , the youngest child to banish , and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe ; besides sending , as soon as she recollected it , proper notice to the other house , which brought her an accession rather of frightened , enquiring companions , than of very useful assistants .
Mr. Musgrove	Till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar - bone was soon replaced , and though Mr Robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew 's state , as to give the information of Captain Wentworth 's visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before .
Mr. Musgrove	How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner , how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power , and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma 's farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow -- actually on the morrow ; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner , as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought . And in short , he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace , that they could assure them all , their heads were both turned by him ; and off they ran , quite as full of glee as of love , and apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles .
Mr. Musgrove	The same story and the same raptures were repeated , when the two girls came with their father , through the gloom of the evening , to make enquiries ; and Mr Musgrove , no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir , could add his confirmation and praise , and hope there would be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off , and only be sorry to think
Mr. Musgrove	""" Oh no ; as to leaving the little boy , "" both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought ; and Anne , in the joy of the escape , could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs ."
Mr. Musgrove	"Charles Musgrove , indeed , afterwards , shewed more of inclination ; "" the child was going on so well , and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth , that , perhaps , he might join them in the evening ; he would not dine from home , but he might walk in for half an hour . "" But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife , with "" Oh !"
Mr. Musgrove	His father very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth , and there being no sufficient reason against it , he ought to go ; and it ended in his making a bold , public declaration , when he came in from shooting , of his meaning to dress directly , and dine at the other house .
Mr. Musgrove	""" Nothing can be going on better than the child , "" said he ; "" so I told my father , just now , that I would come , and he thought me quite right ."
Mr. Musgrove	"She said nothing , therefore , till he was out of the room , but as soon as there was only Anne to hear-- "" So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves , with this poor sick child ; and not a creature coming near us all the evening !"
Mr. Musgrove	Yes ; you see his papa can , and why should not I ?
Mr. Musgrove	Jemima is so careful ; and she could send us word every hour how he was . I really think Charles might as well have told his father we would all come .
Mr. Musgrove	"Mr and Mrs Musgrove can not think it wrong while I remain with him . "" "" Are you serious ? "" cried Mary , her eyes brightening ."
Mr. Musgrove	Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause , and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him , where conviction was at least very agreeable , he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone , though he still wanted her to join them in the evening , when the child might be at rest for the night , and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her , but she was quite unpersuadable ; and this being the case , she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits . They were gone , she hoped , to be happy , however oddly constructed such happiness might seem ; as for herself , she was left with as many sensations of comfort , as were , perhaps , ever likely to be hers . She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child ; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant , making himself agreeable to others ?
Mr. Musgrove	He was to come to breakfast , but not at the Cottage , though that had been proposed at first ; but then he had been pressed to come to the Great House instead , and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs Charles Musgrove 's way , on account of the child , and therefore , somehow , they hardly knew how , it ended in Charles 's being to meet him to breakfast at his father 's .
Mr. Musgrove	as well as the Harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa , and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by Captain Harville . True , upon my honour !
Mr. Musgrove	Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter . We are all very well pleased , however , for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth , it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter ; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent , and Captain Benwick is expected to - day
Captain Harville	A letter from his friend , Captain Harville , having found him out at last , had brought intelligence of Captain Harville 's being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter ; of their being therefore , quite unknowingly , within twenty miles of each other .
Captain Harville	Captain Harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before , and Captain Wentworth 's anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme .
Captain Harville	The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this Mr Musgrove , for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning . They were , consequently , to stay the night there , and not to be expected back till the next day 's dinner . This was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages , Mr Musgrove 's coach containing the four ladies , and Charles 's curricle , in which he drove Captain Wentworth , were descending the long hill into Lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone . After securing accommodations , and ordering a dinner at one of the inns , the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea .
Captain Harville	He had been engaged to Captain Harville 's sister , and was now mourning her loss .
Captain Harville	Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year ; his taste , and his health , and his fortune , all directing him to a residence inexpensive , and by the sea ; and the grandeur of the country , and the retirement of Lyme in the winter , appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick 's state of mind .
Captain Harville	"He will rally again , and be happy with another . "" They all met , and were introduced . Captain Harville was a tall , dark man , with a sensible , benevolent countenance ; a little lame ; and from strong features and want of health , looking much older than Captain Wentworth ."
Captain Harville	Captain Benwick looked , and was , the youngest of the three , and , compared with either of them , a little man . He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air , just as he ought to have , and drew back from conversation .
Captain Harville	Captain Harville , though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners , was a perfect gentleman , unaffected , warm , and obliging .
Captain Harville	On quitting the Cobb , they all went in - doors with their new friends , and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many . Anne had a moment 's astonishment on the subject herself ; but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville , to turn the actual space to the best account , to supply the deficiencies of lodging - house furniture , and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected .
Captain Harville	The varieties in the fitting - up of the rooms , where the common necessaries provided by the owner , in the common indifferent plight , were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood , excellently worked up , and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited , were more than amusing to Anne ; connected as it all was with his profession , the fruit of its labours , the effect of its influence on his habits , the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented , made it to her a something more , or less , than gratification .
Captain Harville	Captain Harville was no reader ; but he had contrived excellent accommodations , and fashioned very pretty shelves , for a tolerable collection of well - bound volumes , the property of Captain Benwick .
Captain Harville	His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise ; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within .
Captain Harville	He drew , he varnished , he carpentered , he glued ; he made toys for the children ; he fashioned new netting - needles and pins with improvements ; and if everything else was done , sat down to his large fishing - net at one corner of the room . Anne thought she left great happiness behind her
Captain Harville	The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow , but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening ; and he came , bringing his friend also , which was more than had been expected , it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers . He ventured among them again , however , though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general .
Captain Harville	While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to Anne 's lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him .
Captain Harville	She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove , Henrietta , and Captain Harville , beside their two selves .
Captain Harville	He gave her a very plain , intelligible account of the whole ; a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding .
Captain Harville	The scheme had received its first impulse by Captain Harville 's wanting to come to Bath on business .
Captain Harville	He had begun to talk of it a week ago ; and by way of doing something , as shooting was over , Charles had proposed coming with him , and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it
Captain Harville	But then , it had been taken up by his father and mother .
Captain Harville	His mother had some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see ; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding - clothes for herself and her sister ; and , in short , it ended in being his mother 's party , that everything might be comfortable and easy to Captain Harville ; and he and Mary were included in it by way of general convenience .
Captain Harville	"Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ? "" He answered rather hesitatingly , "" Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different . If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab - chick in the water ; and Benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long ."
Captain Harville	The party before her were , Mrs Musgrove , talking to Mrs Croft , and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth ; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta , too impatient to wait , had gone out the moment it had cleared , but would be back again soon , and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned . She had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed . There was no delay , no waste of time .
Captain Harville	"She was deep in the happiness of such misery , or the misery of such happiness , instantly . Two minutes after her entering the room , Captain Wentworth said-- "" We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials . "" Materials were at hand , on a separate table ; he went to it , and nearly turning his back to them all , was engrossed by writing . Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter 's engagement , and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper ."
Captain Harville	"Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation , and yet , as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk , she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars ; such as , "" how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again"
Captain Harville	She felt its application to herself , felt it in a nervous thrill all over her ; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table , Captain Wentworth 's pen ceased to move , his head was raised , pausing , listening , and he turned round the next instant to give a look , one quick , conscious look at her . The two ladies continued to talk , to re - urge the same admitted truths , and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation , but Anne heard nothing distinctly ; it was only a buzz of words in her ear , her mind was in confusion . Captain Harville , who had in truth been hearing none of it , now left his seat , and moved to a window , and Anne seeming to watch him , though it was from thorough absence of mind , became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood .
Captain Harville	"He looked at her with a smile , and a little motion of the head , which expressed , "" Come to me , I have something to say ; "" and the unaffected , easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was , strongly enforced the invitation ."
Captain Harville	She roused herself and went to him .
Captain Harville	"The window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting , and though nearer to Captain Wentworth 's table , not very near . As she joined him , Captain Harville 's countenance re - assumed the serious , thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character . "" Look here , "" said he , unfolding a parcel in his hand , and displaying a small miniature painting , "" do you know who that is ?"
Captain Harville	"And with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding , "" Poor Fanny !"
Captain Harville	""" It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved . "" Captain Harville smiled , as much as to say , "" Do you claim that for your sex ? "" and she answered the question , smiling also , "" Yes ."
Captain Harville	""" "" Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men ( which , however , I do not think I shall grant ) , it does not apply to Benwick ."
Captain Harville	""" "" True , "" said Anne , "" very true ; I did not recollect ; but what shall we say now , Captain Harville ?"
Captain Harville	I will not allow it to be more man 's nature than woman 's to be inconstant and forget those they do love , or have loved .
Captain Harville	I believe the reverse .
Captain Harville	"I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental ; and that as our bodies are the strongest , so are our feelings ; capable of bearing most rough usage , and riding out the heaviest weather . "" "" Your feelings may be the strongest , "" replied Anne , "" but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender ."
Captain Harville	"It would be hard , indeed "" ( with a faltering voice ) , "" if woman 's feelings were to be added to all this . "" "" We shall never agree upon this question , "" Captain Harville was beginning to say , when a slight noise called their attention to Captain Wentworth 's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room ."
Captain Harville	""" Have you finished your letter ? "" said Captain Harville ."
Captain Harville	I shall have done in five minutes .
Captain Harville	""" "" There is no hurry on my side . I am only ready whenever you are ."
Captain Harville	"I am in very good anchorage here , "" ( smiling at Anne , ) "" well supplied , and want for nothing . No hurry for a signal at all ."
Captain Harville	"Well , Miss Elliot , "" ( lowering his voice , ) "" as I was saying we shall never agree , I suppose , upon this point ."
Captain Harville	But let me observe that all histories are against you -- all stories , prose and verse .
Captain Harville	If I had such a memory as Benwick , I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument , and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman 's inconstancy .
Captain Harville	Yes , yes , if you please , no reference to examples in books .
Captain Harville	I will not allow books to prove anything .
Captain Harville	""" "" Ah ! "" cried Captain Harville , in a tone of strong feeling , "" if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children , and watches the boat that he has sent them off in , as long as it is in sight , and then turns away and says , ` God knows whether we ever meet again ! '"
Captain Harville	And then , if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again ; when , coming back after a twelvemonth 's absence , perhaps , and obliged to put into another port , he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there , pretending to deceive himself , and saying , ` They can not be here till such a day , ' but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner , and seeing them arrive at last , as if Heaven had given them wings , by many hours sooner still !
Captain Harville	If I could explain to you all this , and all that a man can bear and do , and glories to do , for the sake of these treasures of his existence
Captain Harville	"I speak , you know , only of such men as have hearts ! """
Captain Harville	pressing his own with emotion .
Captain Harville	""" Oh ! "" cried Anne eagerly , "" I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you ."
Captain Harville	No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as -- if I may be allowed the expression -- so long as you have an object .
Captain Harville	I mean while the woman you love lives , and lives for you .
Captain Harville	All the privilege I claim for my own sex ( it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it ) , is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone .
Captain Harville	""" You are a good soul , "" cried Captain Harville , putting his hand on her arm , quite affectionately ."
Captain Harville	"And when I think of Benwick , my tongue is tied . "" Their attention was called towards the others ."
Captain Harville	""" Here , Frederick , you and I part company , I believe , "" said she ."
Captain Harville	""" I am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend ."
Captain Harville	"To - night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party , "" ( turning to Anne . ) "" We had your sister 's card yesterday , and I understood Frederick had a card too , though I did not see it ; and you are disengaged , Frederick , are you not , as well as ourselves ? "" Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste , and either could not or would not answer fully ."
Captain Harville	""" Yes , "" said he , "" very true ; here we separate , but Harville and I shall soon be after you ; that is , Harville , if you are ready , I am in half a minute ."
Captain Harville	I know you will not be sorry to be off .
Captain Harville	"I shall be at your service in half a minute . """
Captain Harville	"She had the kindest "" Good morning , God bless you ! "" from Captain Harville , but from him not a word , nor a look !"
Captain Harville	He had passed out of the room without a look ! She had only time , however , to move closer to the table where he had been writing , when footsteps were heard returning ; the door opened , it was himself .
Captain Harville	He begged their pardon , but he had forgotten his gloves , and instantly crossing the room to the writing table , he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper , placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time , and hastily collecting his gloves , was again out of the room , almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it : the work of an instant !
Captain Harville	"The revolution which one instant had made in Anne , was almost beyond expression . The letter , with a direction hardly legible , to "" Miss A. E.-- , "" was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily ."
Captain Harville	While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick , he had been also addressing her !
Captain Harville	"Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table ; to their protection she must trust , and sinking into the chair which he had occupied , succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written , her eyes devoured the following words : "" I can listen no longer in silence ."
Captain Harville	I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach .
Captain Harville	You pierce my soul .
Captain Harville	I am half agony , half hope .
Captain Harville	Tell me not that I am too late , that such precious feelings are gone for ever . I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it , eight years and a half ago .
Captain Harville	I have loved none but you .
Captain Harville	Unjust I may have been , weak and resentful I have been , but never inconstant .
Captain Harville	You alone have brought me to Bath .
Captain Harville	For you alone , I think and plan .
Captain Harville	Can you fail to have understood my wishes ?
Captain Harville	I had not waited even these ten days , could I have read your feelings , as I think you must have penetrated mine . I can hardly write .
Captain Harville	I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me .
Captain Harville	You sink your voice , but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others .
Captain Harville	I must go , uncertain of my fate ; but I shall return hither , or follow your party , as soon as possible .
Captain Harville	"A word , a look , will be enough to decide whether I enter your father 's house this evening or never . "" Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from ."
Captain Harville	I am afraid there had been some mistake ; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth , that we hope to see them both .
Captain Harville	Captain Harville has no thought but of going .
Captain Harville	Charles , if you see Captain Harville anywhere , remember to give Miss Anne 's message .
Captain Harville	Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged , I 'll answer for it ; and Captain Wentworth the same , I dare say .
Captain Harville	Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself , it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville .
Captain Harville	He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off ; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment , that I might see it ; and if I do not turn back now , I have no chance .
Captain Harville	Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment . That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four - and - twenty hours . It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks , or words , or actions occasionally encouraged ; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville ; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper , and poured out his feelings .
Captain Harville	He had imagined himself indifferent , when he had only been angry ; and he had been unjust to her merits , because he had been a sufferer from them . Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself , maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness ; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice , and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself .
Captain Harville	At Lyme , he had received lessons of more than one sort .
Captain Harville	The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused him , and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville 's had fixed her superiority .
Captain Harville	In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove ( the attempts of angry pride ) , he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible ; that he had not cared , could not care , for Louisa ; though till that day , till the leisure for reflection which followed it , he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa 's could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . There , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self - will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind .
Captain Harville	There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost ; and there begun to deplore the pride , the folly , the madness of resentment , which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way .
Captain Harville	From that period his penance had become severe .
Captain Harville	He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa 's accident , no sooner begun to feel himself alive again , than he had begun to feel himself , though alive , not at liberty .
Captain Harville	""" I found , "" said he , "" that I was considered by Harville an engaged man ! That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment ."
Captain Harville	I was startled and shocked .
Captain Harville	To a degree , I could contradict this instantly ; but , when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same -- her own family , nay , perhaps herself -- I was no longer at my own disposal .
Captain Harville	I was hers in honour if she wished it .
Captain Harville	I had been unguarded .
Captain Harville	"I had not thought seriously on this subject before . I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways ; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls , at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report , were there no other ill effects . I had been grossly wrong , and must abide the consequences . "" He found too late , in short , that he had entangled himself ; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at all , he must regard himself as bound to her , if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed ."
Captain Harville	It determined him to leave Lyme , and await her complete recovery elsewhere .
Captain Harville	"He would gladly weaken , by any fair means , whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist ; and he went , therefore , to his brother 's , meaning after a while to return to Kellynch , and act as circumstances might require . "" I was six weeks with Edward , "" said he , "" and saw him happy ."
Captain Harville	I could have no other pleasure .
Captain Harville	I deserved none .
Captain Harville	"He enquired after you very particularly ; asked even if you were personally altered , little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter . """
Captain Harville	"It is something for a woman to be assured , in her eight - and - twentieth year , that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth ; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Anne , by comparing it with former words , and feeling it to be the result , not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment . He had remained in Shropshire , lamenting the blindness of his own pride , and the blunders of his own calculations , till at once released from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with Benwick . "" Here , "" said he , "" ended the worst of my state ; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness ; I could exert myself ; I could do something ."
Captain Harville	Within the first five minutes I said , ` I will be at Bath on Wednesday , ' and I was .
Captain Harville	Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come ? and to arrive with some degree of hope ?
Captain Harville	It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past , as I did ; and one encouragement happened to be mine .
Captain Harville	"I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others , but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man , at least , of better pretensions than myself ; and I could not help often saying , ` Was this for me ? ' """
Captain Harville	"The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him : the moment of Mr Elliot 's appearing and tearing her away , and one or two subsequent moments , marked by returning hope or increasing despondency , were dwelt on with energy . """
Captain Harville	"To see you , "" cried he , "" in the midst of those who could not be my well - wishers ; to see your cousin close by you , conversing and smiling , and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match ! To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you !"
Captain Harville	Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared ?
Captain Harville	How could I look on without agony ?
Captain Harville	"Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you , was not the recollection of what had been , the knowledge of her influence , the indelible , immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done-- was it not all against me ? "" "" You should have distinguished , "" replied Anne ."
Captain Harville	""" "" Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus , "" he replied , "" but I could not ."
Captain Harville	I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of your character .
Captain Harville	I could not bring it into play ; it was overwhelmed , buried , lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under year after year .
Captain Harville	I could think of you only as one who had yielded , who had given me up , who had been influenced by any one rather than by me .
Captain Harville	I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery .
Captain Harville	I had no reason to believe her of less authority now .
Captain Harville	""" I should have thought , "" said Anne , "" that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this ."
Captain Harville	I left you in this belief ; and yet , I was determined to see you again .
Captain Harville	My spirits rallied with the morning , and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here .
Captain Harville	She cared not for Mrs Clay , and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister . With the Musgroves , there was the happy chat of perfect ease ; with Captain Harville , the kind - hearted intercourse of brother and sister ; with Lady Russell , attempts at conversation , which a delicious consciousness cut short ; with Admiral and Mrs Croft , everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest , which the same consciousness sought to conceal ; and with Captain Wentworth , some moments of communications continually occurring , and always the hope of more , and always the knowledge of his being there .
Captain Harville	"But I mean , that I was right in submitting to her , and that if I had done otherwise , I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up , because I should have suffered in my conscience . I have now , as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature , nothing to reproach myself with ; and if I mistake not , a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman 's portion . "" He looked at her , looked at Lady Russell , and looking again at her , replied , as if in cool deliberation-- "" Not yet . But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time ."
Captain Harville	I trust to being in charity with her soon .
Captain Harville	But I too have been thinking over the past , and a question has suggested itself , whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady ?
Captain Harville	My own self .
Captain Harville	Tell me if , when I returned to England in the year eight , with a few thousand pounds , and was posted into the Laconia , if I had then written to you , would you have answered my letter ? Would you , in short , have renewed the engagement then ?
Captain Harville	""" Good God ! "" he cried , "" you would !"
Captain Harville	It is not that I did not think of it , or desire it , as what could alone crown all my other success ; but I was proud , too proud to ask again .
Captain Harville	I did not understand you .
Captain Harville	I shut my eyes , and would not understand you , or do you justice .
Captain Harville	This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself .
Captain Harville	It is a sort of pain , too , which is new to me .
Captain Harville	I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed . I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards .
Captain Harville	"Like other great men under reverses , "" he added , with a smile ."
Captain Harville	""" I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune ."
Captain Harville	"I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve . """
Captain Harville	Shocked as Captain Harville was , he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful ; and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done .
Captain Benwick	They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring ; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long , when they saw him coming after them , with three companions , all well known already , by description , to be Captain and Mrs Harville , and a Captain Benwick , who was staying with them .
Captain Benwick	Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia ; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him , on his return from Lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies .
Captain Benwick	He had been engaged to Captain Harville 's sister , and was now mourning her loss .
Captain Benwick	Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville , or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change . He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily , uniting very strong feelings with quiet , serious , and retiring manners , and a decided taste for reading , and sedentary pursuits . To finish the interest of the story , the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed , if possible , augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance , and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely .
Captain Benwick	Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year ; his taste , and his health , and his fortune , all directing him to a residence inexpensive , and by the sea ; and the grandeur of the country , and the retirement of Lyme in the winter , appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick 's state of mind .
Captain Benwick	The sympathy and good - will excited towards Captain Benwick was very great .
Captain Benwick	""" And yet , "" said Anne to herself , as they now moved forward to meet the party , "" he has not , perhaps , a more sorrowing heart than I have . I can not believe his prospects so blighted for ever ."
Captain Benwick	He is younger than I am ; younger in feeling , if not in fact ; younger as a man .
Captain Benwick	"He will rally again , and be happy with another . "" They all met , and were introduced . Captain Harville was a tall , dark man , with a sensible , benevolent countenance ; a little lame ; and from strong features and want of health , looking much older than Captain Wentworth ."
Captain Benwick	Captain Benwick looked , and was , the youngest of the three , and , compared with either of them , a little man . He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air , just as he ought to have , and drew back from conversation .
Captain Benwick	Captain Harville was no reader ; but he had contrived excellent accommodations , and fashioned very pretty shelves , for a tolerable collection of well - bound volumes , the property of Captain Benwick .
Captain Benwick	The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow , but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening ; and he came , bringing his friend also , which was more than had been expected , it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers . He ventured among them again , however , though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general .
Captain Benwick	While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to Anne 's lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him .
Captain Benwick	He was shy , and disposed to abstraction ; but the engaging mildness of her countenance , and gentleness of her manners , soon had their effect ; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion . He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading , though principally in poetry ; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening 's indulgence in the discussion of subjects , which his usual companions had probably no concern in , she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction , which had naturally grown out of their conversation . For , though shy , he did not seem reserved ; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints ; and having talked of poetry , the richness of the present age , and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first - rate poets , trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred , and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos ; and moreover , how the Giaour was to be pronounced , he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet , and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other ; he repeated , with such tremulous feeling , the various lines which imaged a broken heart , or a mind destroyed by wretchedness , and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood , that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry , and to say , that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely ; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly . His looks shewing him not pained , but pleased with this allusion to his situation , she was emboldened to go on ; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind , she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study ; and on being requested to particularize , mentioned such works of our best moralists , such collections of the finest letters , such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering , as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts , and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances . Captain Benwick listened attentively , and seemed grateful for the interest implied ; and though with a shake of the head , and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his , noted down the names of those she recommended , and promised to procure and read them
Captain Benwick	Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme . She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight . Anne enquired after Captain Benwick , Mary 's face was clouded directly . Charles laughed .
Captain Benwick	Captain Benwick is very well , I believe , but he is a very odd young man .
Captain Benwick	I do not know what he would be at .
Captain Benwick	We asked him to come home with us for a day or two
Captain Benwick	: Charles undertook to give him some shooting , and he seemed quite delighted , and , for my part , I thought it was all settled ; when behold ! on Tuesday night , he made a very awkward sort of excuse ; ` he never shot ' and he had ` been quite misunderstood , ' and he had promised this and he had promised that , and the end of it was , I found , that he did not mean to come .
Captain Benwick	I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull ; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart - broken man as Captain Benwick .
Captain Benwick	""" He fancied that if he went with us , he should find you close by : he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross ; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off , his heart failed him ,"
Captain Benwick	and he had not courage to come . That is the fact , upon my honour , Mary knows it is .
Captain Benwick	""" But Mary did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot , or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed . Anne 's good - will , however , was not to be lessened by what she heard . She boldly acknowledged herself flattered , and continued her enquiries . "" Oh !"
Captain Benwick	"he talks of you , "" cried Charles , "" in such terms-- "" Mary interrupted him ."
Captain Benwick	""" I declare , Charles , I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there ."
Captain Benwick	"I declare , Anne , he never talks of you at all . "" "" No , "" admitted Charles , "" I do not know that he ever does , in a general way ; but however , it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly ."
Captain Benwick	His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation , and he wants to talk to you about them ; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks -- oh !
Captain Benwick	I can not pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine -- I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it ; and then ` Miss Elliot ' was spoken of in the highest terms !
Captain Benwick	""" "" And I am sure , "" cried Mary , warmly , "" it was a very little to his credit , if he did ."
Captain Benwick	""" I must see Captain Benwick before I decide , "" said Lady Russell , smiling . "" And that you are very likely to do very soon , I can tell you , ma'am , """
Captain Benwick	""" Though he had not nerves for coming away with us , and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here , he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself , you may depend on it ."
Captain Benwick	I told him the distance and the road , and I told him of the church 's being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , I thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon .
Captain Benwick	""" "" Well , as your joint acquaintance , then , I shall be very happy to see Captain Benwick . "" "" You will not find anything very agreeable in him , I assure you , ma'am ."
Captain Benwick	He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived .
Captain Benwick	He has walked with me , sometimes , from one end of the sands to the other , without saying a word . He is not at all a well - bred young man .
Captain Benwick	I am sure you will not like him .
Captain Benwick	""" I think Lady Russell would like him ."
Captain Benwick	I think she would be so much pleased with his mind , that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner .
Captain Benwick	""" I am sure Lady Russell would like him ."
Captain Benwick	He is just Lady Russell 's sort .
Captain Benwick	Give him a book , and he will read all day long .
Captain Benwick	""" "" Yes , that he will ! "" exclaimed Mary , tauntingly ."
Captain Benwick	""" He will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drop 's one 's scissors , or anything that happens . Do you think Lady Russell would like that ? "" Lady Russell could not help laughing ."
Captain Benwick	He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week , and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him ; but , as Charles maintained to the last , Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch . There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick , from this time . Lady Russell could not hear the door - bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father 's grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him . Captain Benwick came not , however .
Captain Benwick	Captain Benwick of the party , for he had been invited
Captain Benwick	as well as the Harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa , and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by Captain Harville . True , upon my honour !
Captain Benwick	Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter . We are all very well pleased , however , for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth , it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter ; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent , and Captain Benwick is expected to - day
Captain Benwick	Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say ; but if you remember , I never thought him attached to Louisa ; I never could see anything of it .
Captain Benwick	And this is the end , you see , of Captain Benwick 's being supposed to be an admirer of yours .
Captain Benwick	Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove !
Captain Benwick	Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel ! Perhaps he had quitted the field , had given Louisa up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her .
Captain Benwick	She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity , or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend .
Captain Benwick	She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly . Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove ! The high - spirited , joyous - talking Louisa Musgrove , and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading , Captain Benwick , seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other .
Captain Benwick	They had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since Henrietta 's coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and Louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable .
Captain Benwick	That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary , from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself .
Captain Benwick	She did not mean , however , to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity , than Mary might have allowed . She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment .
Captain Benwick	He had an affectionate heart .
Captain Benwick	He must love somebody .
Captain Benwick	He would gain cheerfulness , and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron ; nay , that was probably learnt already ; of course they had fallen in love over poetry .
Captain Benwick	The conclusion of the whole was , that if the woman who had been sensible of Captain Wentworth 's merits could be allowed to prefer another man , there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder ; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it , certainly nothing to be regretted . No , it was not regret which made Anne 's heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free .
Captain Benwick	The visit of ceremony was paid and returned ; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned , and Captain Benwick , too , without even half a smile .
Captain Benwick	He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout , and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares with him in everything , and to walk for her life to do him good .
Captain Benwick	"Can I be of any use ? "" "" None , I thank you , unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together ."
Captain Benwick	But now , the matter has take the strangest turn of all ; for this young lady , the same Miss Musgrove , instead of being to marry Frederick , is to marry James Benwick .
Captain Benwick	"You know James Benwick . "" "" A little ."
Captain Benwick	I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick .
Captain Benwick	""" "" Well , she is to marry him ."
Captain Benwick	""" I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man , "" said Anne , "" and I understand that he bears an excellent character ."
Captain Benwick	yes , yes , there is not a word to be said against James Benwick .
Captain Benwick	He is only a commander , it is true , made last summer , and these are bad times for getting on , but he has not another fault that I know of .
Captain Benwick	""" Indeed you are mistaken there , sir ; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick 's manners ."
Captain Benwick	""" Well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality"
Captain Benwick	"She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other , not at all to represent Captain Benwick 's manners as the very best that could possibly be ; and , after a little hesitation , she was beginning to say , "" I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends , "" but the Admiral interrupted her with-- "" And the thing is certainly true . It is not a mere bit of gossip ."
Captain Benwick	"I fancy they are all at Uppercross . "" This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist ; she said , therefore , "" I hope , Admiral , I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth 's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy ."
Captain Benwick	But what I mean is , that I hope there is nothing in Captain Wentworth 's manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill - used by his friend , which might appear , you know , without its being absolutely said .
Captain Benwick	I should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be destroyed , or even wounded , by a circumstance of this sort .
Captain Benwick	He does not give the least fling at Benwick ; does not so much as say , ` I wonder at it , I have a reason of my own for wondering at it . '
Captain Benwick	No , you would not guess , from his way of writing , that he had ever thought of this Miss ( what 's her name ? ) for himself . He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together ; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that , I think .
Captain Benwick	Breakfast had not been long over , when they were joined by Captain and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick ; with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme . They ought to be setting off for Uppercross by one , and in the mean while were to be all together , and out of doors as long as they could .
Captain Benwick	Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her , as soon as they were all fairly in the street .
Captain Benwick	Their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again ; and they walked together some time , talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron , and still as unable as before , and as unable as any other two readers , to think exactly alike of the merits of either , till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party , and instead of Captain Benwick , she had Captain Harville by her side .
Captain Benwick	""" Miss Elliot , "" said he , speaking rather low , "" you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much ."
Captain Benwick	I wish he could have such company oftener .
Captain Benwick	It is bad for him , I know , to be shut up as he is ; but what can we do ?
Captain Benwick	""" No , "" said Anne , "" that I can easily believe to be impossible ; but in time , perhaps -- we know what time does in every case of affliction , and you must remember , Captain Harville , that your friend may yet be called a young mourner -- only last summer , I understand ."
Captain Benwick	so with all the kind leave - taking , and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined , they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door , and still accompanied by Captain Benwick , who seemed to cling to them to the last , proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb .
Captain Benwick	Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her .
Captain Benwick	"Lord Byron 's "" dark blue seas "" could not fail of being brought forward by their present view , and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible . It was soon drawn , perforce another way ."
Captain Benwick	"she is dead ! "" screamed Mary , catching hold of her husband , and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable ; and in another moment , Henrietta , sinking under the conviction , lost her senses too , and would have fallen on the steps , but for Captain Benwick and Anne , who caught and supported her between them ."
Captain Benwick	""" Captain Benwick obeyed , and Charles at the same moment , disengaging himself from his wife , they were both with him ; and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them , and everything was done that Anne had prompted , but in vain ;"
Captain Benwick	"He caught the word ; it seemed to rouse him at once , and saying only-- "" True , true , a surgeon this instant , "" was darting away , when Anne eagerly suggested-- "" Captain Benwick , would not it be better for Captain Benwick ? He knows where a surgeon is to be found . "" Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea , and in a moment ( it was all done in rapid moments ) Captain Benwick had resigned the poor corpse - like figure entirely to the brother 's care , and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity ."
Captain Benwick	Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of Mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , Charles taking care of his sister , and Captain Benwick attending to her . She gave a moment 's recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . There she had listened to Henrietta 's schemes for Dr Shirley 's leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen Mr Elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa , or those who were wrapt up in her welfare . Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance .
Captain Benwick	When he came away , she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good .
Captain Benwick	Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father 's house in Camden Place , or her own sister 's intimacy with Mrs Clay . She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her .
Mrs. Harville	They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring ; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long , when they saw him coming after them , with three companions , all well known already , by description , to be Captain and Mrs Harville , and a Captain Benwick , who was staying with them .
Mrs. Harville	Mrs Harville , a degree less polished than her husband , seemed , however , to have the same good feelings ; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own , because the friends of Captain Wentworth , or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them . The dinner , already ordered at the inn , was at last , though unwillingly , accepted as a excuse ; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should have brought any such party to Lyme , without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them .
Mrs. Harville	Poor Harville , sister !
Mrs. Harville	You know how much he wanted money : worse than myself .
Mrs. Harville	He had a wife .
Mrs. Harville	I shall never forget his happiness . He felt it all , so much for her sake .
Mrs. Harville	""" You were living with your husband , and were the only woman on board . "" "" But you , yourself , brought Mrs Harville , her sister , her cousin , and three children , round from Portsmouth to Plymouth ."
Mrs. Harville	I would assist any brother officer 's wife that I could , and I would bring anything of Harville 's from the world 's end , if he wanted it .
Mrs. Harville	""" My feelings , you see , did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all her family to Plymouth ."
Mrs. Harville	"You may think , Miss Elliot , whether he is dear to us ! "" Anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different . Mrs Harville 's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home , determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk ; they would accompany them to their door , and then return and set off themselves ."
Mrs. Harville	so with all the kind leave - taking , and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined , they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door , and still accompanied by Captain Benwick , who seemed to cling to them to the last , proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb .
Mrs. Harville	They would not listen to scruples : he was obeyed ; they were all beneath his roof ; and while Louisa , under Mrs Harville 's direction , was conveyed up stairs , and given possession of her own bed , assistance , cordials , restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them . Louisa had once opened her eyes , but soon closed them again , without apparent consciousness .
Mrs. Harville	"They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more ; and yet perhaps , by "" putting the children away in the maid 's room , or swinging a cot somewhere , "" they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides , supposing they might wish to stay ; though , with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove , there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville 's care entirely ."
Mrs. Harville	Mrs Harville was a very experienced nurse , and her nursery - maid , who had lived with her long , and gone about with her everywhere , was just such another .
Mrs. Harville	Between these two , she could want no possible attendance by day or night .
Mrs. Harville	Charles agreed , but declared his resolution of not going away . He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would .
Mrs. Harville	But as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist Mrs Harville , I think it need be only one .
Mrs. Harville	Mrs Charles Musgrove will , of course , wish to get back to her children ; but if Anne will stay , no one so proper , so capable as Anne .
Mrs. Harville	"A bed on the floor in Louisa 's room would be sufficient for her , if Mrs Harville would but think so . "" One thing more , and all seemed arranged ."
Mrs. Harville	"In speaking of the Harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of Mrs Harville 's exertions as a nurse . "" She really left nothing for Mary to do ."
Mrs. Harville	He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do .
Mrs. Harville	They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that Anne was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence . She was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character . A few days had made a change indeed ! If Louisa recovered , it would all be well again .
William Elliot	16 There was one point which Anne , on returning to her family , would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot 's being in love with Elizabeth , which was , her father 's not being in love with Mrs Clay ; and she was very far from easy about it , when she had been at home a few hours .
William Elliot	On going down to breakfast the next morning , she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady 's side of meaning to leave them .
William Elliot	"She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said , that "" now Miss Anne was come , she could not suppose herself at all wanted ; "" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper , "" That must not be any reason , indeed ."
William Elliot	He spoke and looked so much in earnest , that Anne was not surprised to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself .
William Elliot	"Her countenance , perhaps , might express some watchfulness ; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister . The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties , and promise to stay . In the course of the same morning , Anne and her father chancing to be alone together , he began to compliment her on her improved looks ; he thought her "" less thin in her person , in her cheeks ; her skin , her complexion , greatly improved ; clearer , fresher ."
William Elliot	Mrs Clay has been using it at my recommendation , and you see what it has done for her .
William Elliot	"You see how it has carried away her freckles . "" If Elizabeth could but have heard this ! Such personal praise might have struck her , especially as it did not appear to Anne that the freckles were at all lessened . But everything must take its chance ."
William Elliot	The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour , and of Anne so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in Bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed .
William Elliot	"As Mr Elliot became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others . His manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told Anne , almost ready to exclaim , "" Can this be Mr Elliot ? "" and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man ."
William Elliot	Everything united in him ; good understanding , correct opinions , knowledge of the world , and a warm heart .
William Elliot	He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour , without pride or weakness ; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune , without display ; he judged for himself in everything essential , without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum .
William Elliot	He was steady , observant , moderate , candid ; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness , which fancied itself strong feeling ; and yet , with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely , and a value for all the felicities of domestic life , which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess .
William Elliot	She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage .
William Elliot	Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay .
William Elliot	It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently ; and it did not surprise her , therefore , that Lady Russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent , nothing to require more motives than appeared , in Mr Elliot 's great desire of a reconciliation . In Lady Russell 's view , it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot , at a mature time of life , should feel it a most desirable object , and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people , to be on good terms with the head of his family ; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear , and only erring in the heyday of youth .
William Elliot	"In that house Elizabeth must be first ; and she was in the habit of such general observance as "" Miss Elliot , "" that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible ."
William Elliot	Mr Elliot , too , it must be remembered , had not been a widower seven months .
William Elliot	A little delay on his side might be very excusable .
William Elliot	In fact , Anne could never see the crape round his hat , without fearing that she was the inexcusable one , in attributing to him such imaginations ; for though his marriage had not been very happy , still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved .
William Elliot	However it might end , he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in Bath : she saw nobody equal to him ; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme , which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again , and to see more of , as herself .
William Elliot	He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness . She knew it well ; and she remembered another person 's look also .
William Elliot	His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers .
William Elliot	It was not merely complaisance , it must be a liking to the cause , which made him enter warmly into her father and sister 's solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them .
William Elliot	Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount , but had never seen any of the rest of the family ; and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony , ever since the death of that said late viscount , when , in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter 's at the same time , there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch .
William Elliot	How to have this anxious business set to rights , and be admitted as cousins again , was the question : and it was a question which , in a more rational manner , neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot thought unimportant .
William Elliot	Sir Walter , however , would choose his own means , and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation , regret , and entreaty , to his right honourable cousin .
William Elliot	Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could admire the letter ; but it did all that was wanted , in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess .
William Elliot	"Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name of "" a charming woman , "" because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody ."
William Elliot	"when Anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to Mr Elliot , he agreed to their being nothing in themselves , but still maintained that , as a family connexion , as good company , as those who would collect good company around them , they had their value . Anne smiled and said , "" My idea of good company , Mr Elliot , is the company of clever , well - informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what I call good company . "" "" You are mistaken , "" said he gently , "" that is not good company ; that is the best . Good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice . Birth and good manners are essential ; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company ; on the contrary , it will do very well . My cousin Anne shakes her head . She is not satisfied ."
William Elliot	In London , perhaps , in your present quiet style of living , it might be as you say : but in Bath ; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing : always acceptable as acquaintance .
William Elliot	But here you are in Bath , and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot .
William Elliot	""" He looked , as he spoke , to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately occupying : a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant ; and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride , she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay ; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father 's getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her ."
William Elliot	""" Lady Dalrymple , Lady Dalrymple , "" was the rejoicing sound ; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance , Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her . Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , escorted by Mr Elliot and Colonel Wallis , who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant , advanced into the room . The others joined them , and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included . She was divided from Captain Wentworth ."
William Elliot	The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches : Anne was among those on the foremost , and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well , with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis , as to have a seat by her . Miss Elliot , surrounded by her cousins , and the principal object of Colonel Wallis 's gallantry , was quite contented .
William Elliot	Towards the close of it , in the interval succeeding an Italian song , she explained the words of the song to Mr Elliot .
William Elliot	""" "" Yes , yes , I see you are ."
William Elliot	I see you know nothing of the matter .
William Elliot	""" Perhaps , "" said Mr Elliot , speaking low , "" I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of . "" "" Indeed !"
William Elliot	You can have been acquainted with it only since I came to Bath , excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family .
William Elliot	"Your person , your disposition , accomplishments , manner ; they were all present to me . "" Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise ."
William Elliot	She wondered , and questioned him eagerly ; but in vain .
William Elliot	He delighted in being asked , but he would not tell .
William Elliot	It seemed as if she had been one moment too late ; and as long as she dared observe , he did not look again : but the performance was recommencing , and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward .
William Elliot	When she could give another glance , he had moved away .
William Elliot	He could not have come nearer to her if he would ; she was so surrounded and shut in : but she would rather have caught his eye .
William Elliot	Mr Elliot 's speech , too , distressed her .
William Elliot	She had no longer any inclination to talk to him . She wished him not so near her .
William Elliot	She remained in her seat , and so did Lady Russell ; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot ; and she did not mean , whatever she might feel on Lady Russell 's account , to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth , if he gave her the opportunity .
William Elliot	Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again , and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret , in a manner not to be refused , to sit between them ; and by some other removals , and a little scheming of her own , Anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before , much more within reach of a passer - by .
William Elliot	It came from Mr Elliot .
William Elliot	He begged her pardon , but she must be applied to , to explain Italian again .
William Elliot	Jealousy of Mr Elliot !
William Elliot	It was misery to think of Mr Elliot 's attentions .
William Elliot	Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith , meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call ; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object .
William Elliot	She felt a great deal of good - will towards him . In spite of the mischief of his attentions , she owed him gratitude and regard , perhaps compassion . She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance , of the right which he seemed to have to interest her , by everything in situation , by his own sentiments , by his early prepossession .
William Elliot	She was sure of a pleasant reception ; and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming , seemed hardly to have expected her , though it had been an appointment .
William Elliot	""" Yes ; I did not see them myself , but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in the room . "" "" The Ibbotsons , were they there ?"
William Elliot	"She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend 's penetration , unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her . After another short silence-- "" Pray , "" said Mrs Smith , "" is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ? Does he know that I am in Bath ?"
William Elliot	""" Mr Elliot ! "" repeated Anne , looking up surprised ."
William Elliot	"She caught it instantaneously ; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety , soon added , more composedly , "" Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot ? """
William Elliot	""" I have been a good deal acquainted with him , "" replied Mrs Smith , gravely , "" but it seems worn out now ."
William Elliot	"Had I known it , I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you . "" "" To confess the truth , "" said Mrs Smith , assuming her usual air of cheerfulness , "" that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have ."
William Elliot	I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot . I want your interest with him .
William Elliot	"He can be of essential service to me ; and if you would have the goodness , my dear Miss Elliot , to make it an object to yourself , of course it is done . """
William Elliot	""" I should be extremely happy ; I hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you , "" replied Anne ; "" but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case ."
William Elliot	You must consider me only as Mr Elliot 's relation .
William Elliot	"If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me . "" Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance , and then , smiling , said-- "" I have been a little premature , I perceive ; I beg your pardon ."
William Elliot	To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled , and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot 's good fortune .
William Elliot	I am not going to marry Mr Elliot .
William Elliot	Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike , agreeable man ? Let me recommend Mr Elliot .
William Elliot	I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis ; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis ?
William Elliot	""" "" My dear Mrs Smith , Mr Elliot 's wife has not been dead much above half a year . He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one . "" "" Oh !"
William Elliot	"if these are your only objections , "" cried Mrs Smith , archly , "" Mr Elliot is safe , and I shall give myself no more trouble about him ."
William Elliot	Let him know me to be a friend of yours , and then he will think little of the trouble required , which it is very natural for him now , with so many affairs and engagements of his own , to avoid and get rid of as he can ; very natural , perhaps .
William Elliot	Of course , he can not be aware of the importance to me .
William Elliot	Mr Elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman .
William Elliot	You are safe in all worldly matters , and safe in his character .
William Elliot	He will not be led astray ; he will not be misled by others to his ruin .
William Elliot	""" "" No , "" said Anne , "" I can readily believe all that of my cousin . He seems to have a calm decided temper , not at all open to dangerous impressions ."
William Elliot	I consider him with great respect .
William Elliot	But I have not known him long ; and he is not a man , I think , to be known intimately soon .
William Elliot	Will not this manner of speaking of him , Mrs Smith , convince you that he is nothing to me ?
William Elliot	And , upon my word , he is nothing to me .
William Elliot	Should he ever propose to me ( which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing ) , I shall not accept him .
William Elliot	"I assure you , Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing , in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford : not Mr Elliot ; it is not Mr Elliot that-- "" She stopped , regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much ; but less would hardly have been sufficient ."
William Elliot	Mrs Smith would hardly have believed so soon in Mr Elliot 's failure , but from the perception of there being a somebody else . As it was , she instantly submitted , and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond ; and Anne , eager to escape farther notice , was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot ; where she could have received the idea , or from whom she could have heard it .
William Elliot	"I observed no one in particular . "" "" It was my friend Mrs Rooke ; Nurse Rooke ; who , by - the - bye , had a great curiosity to see you , and was delighted to be in the way to let you in . She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday ; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot . She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself , which did not seem bad authority ."
William Elliot	""" But , "" continued Anne , presently , "" though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot , I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could ."
William Elliot	Shall I mention to him your being in Bath ?
William Elliot	""" I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years ?"
William Elliot	""" Not before he was married , I suppose ? """
William Elliot	""" Yes ; he was not married when I knew him first ."
William Elliot	Then do tell me what he was at that time of life .
William Elliot	I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man .
William Elliot	Was he at all such as he appears now ?
William Elliot	""" "" I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years , "" was Mrs Smith 's answer , given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther ; and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity ."
William Elliot	However , I have determined ; I think I am right ; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot 's real character .
William Elliot	Though I fully believe that , at present , you have not the smallest intention of accepting him , there is no saying what may happen .
William Elliot	You might , some time or other , be differently affected towards him .
William Elliot	Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience ; a designing , wary , cold - blooded being , who thinks only of himself ; whom for his own interest or ease , would be guilty of any cruelty , or any treachery , that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character . He has no feeling for others .
William Elliot	Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin , he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction . He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion .
William Elliot	"he is black at heart , hollow and black ! """
William Elliot	But I will try to command myself . I will not abuse him .
William Elliot	I will only tell you what I have found him .
William Elliot	He was the intimate friend of my dear husband , who trusted and loved him , and thought him as good as himself .
William Elliot	I found them most intimate friends ; and I , too , became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot , and entertained
William Elliot	the highest opinion of him
William Elliot	At nineteen , you know , one does not think very seriously ; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others , and much more agreeable than most others , and we were almost always together .
William Elliot	He was then the inferior in circumstances ; he was then the poor one ; he had chambers in the Temple , and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman . He had always a home with us whenever he chose it ; he was always welcome ; he was like a brother .
William Elliot	"My poor Charles , who had the finest , most generous spirit in the world , would have divided his last farthing with him ; and I know that his purse was open to him ; I know that he often assisted him . """
William Elliot	""" This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot 's life , "" said Anne , "" which has always excited my particular curiosity ."
William Elliot	It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister . I never knew him myself ; I only heard of him ; but there was a something in his conduct then , with regard to my father and sister , and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage , which I never could quite reconcile with present times .
William Elliot	""" He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him , but I heard him speak of them for ever ."
William Elliot	I know he was invited and encouraged , and I know he did not choose to go .
William Elliot	I can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , I knew all about it at the time .
William Elliot	I was privy to all the fors and againsts ; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans ; and
William Elliot	"though I did not know his wife previously , her inferior situation in society , indeed , rendered that impossible , yet I knew her all her life afterwards , or at least till within the last two years of her life , and can answer any question you may wish to put . "" "" Nay , "" said Anne , "" I have no particular enquiry to make about her . I have always understood they were not a happy couple . But I should like to know why , at that time of his life , he should slight my father 's acquaintance as he did . My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him . Why did Mr Elliot draw back ?"
William Elliot	""" "" Mr Elliot , "" replied Mrs Smith , "" at that period of his life , had one object in view : to make his fortune , and by a rather quicker process than the law . He was determined to make it by marriage ."
William Elliot	He was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and I know it was his belief ( whether justly or not , of course I can not decide ) , that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence .
William Elliot	That was his motive for drawing back , I can assure you .
William Elliot	He told me the whole story .
William Elliot	He had no concealments with me .
William Elliot	It was curious , that having just left you behind me in Bath , my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin ; and that , through him , I should be continually hearing of your father and sister . He described one Miss Elliot , and I thought very affectionately of the other .
William Elliot	""" Perhaps , "" cried Anne , struck by a sudden idea , "" you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot ?"
William Elliot	""" This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night , "" cried Anne ."
William Elliot	I found he had been used to hear of me .
William Elliot	Mr Elliot married then completely for money ?
William Elliot	"The circumstances , probably , which first opened your eyes to his character . "" Mrs Smith hesitated a little here ."
William Elliot	I think differently now ; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions ; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing .
William Elliot	` To do the best for himself , ' passed as a duty .
William Elliot	""" But was not she a very low woman ? "" "" Yes ; which I objected to , but he would not regard ."
William Elliot	Money , money , was all that he wanted .
William Elliot	She was a fine woman , had had a decent education , was brought forward by some cousins , thrown by chance into Mr Elliot 's company , and fell in love with him ; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side , with respect to her birth .
William Elliot	All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune , before he committed himself .
William Elliot	Depend upon it , whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now , as a young man he had not the smallest value for it . His chance for the Kellynch estate was something , but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt .
William Elliot	I have often heard him declare , that if baronetcies were saleable , anybody should have his for fifty pounds , arms and motto , name and livery included ; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject .
William Elliot	""" You have asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago ."
William Elliot	"I am more curious to know why he should be so different now . "" "" But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary ; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . """
William Elliot	"The box was brought and placed before her , and Mrs Smith , sighing over it as she unlocked it , said-- "" This is full of papers belonging to him , to my husband ; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him ."
William Elliot	The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine .
William Elliot	But he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when I came to examine his papers , I found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed .
William Elliot	Here it is ; I would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot , I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy .
William Elliot	Give me joy : I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss. They are gone back to Kellynch , and almost made me swear to visit them this summer ; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor , to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer .
William Elliot	The name of Walter I can drop , thank God !
William Elliot	But it shows you the man .
William Elliot	Mark his professions to my poor husband .
William Elliot	I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago , and I will shew him as he is now .
William Elliot	I can not produce written proof again , but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire , of what he is now wanting , and what he is now doing . He is no hypocrite now .
William Elliot	He truly wants to marry you .
William Elliot	His present attentions to your family are very sincere : quite from the heart .
William Elliot	"I will give you my authority : his friend Colonel Wallis . "" "" Colonel Wallis !"
William Elliot	The stream is as good as at first ; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away . Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his views on you , which said Colonel Wallis , I imagine to be , in himself , a sensible , careful , discerning sort of character ; but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife , to whom he tells things which he had better not , and he repeats it all to her .
William Elliot	Mr Elliot 's having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father .
William Elliot	Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement .
William Elliot	He had seen you indeed , before he came to Bath , and admired you , but without knowing it to be you .
William Elliot	"Did he see you last summer or autumn , ` somewhere down in the west , ' to use her own words , without knowing it to be you ? "" "" He certainly did ."
William Elliot	""" "" Well , "" continued Mrs Smith , triumphantly , "" grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted ."
William Elliot	He saw you then at Lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place , as Miss Anne Elliot , and from that moment , I have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there .
William Elliot	"My account states , that your sister 's friend , the lady now staying with you , whom I have heard you mention , came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September ( in short when they first came themselves ) , and has been staying there ever since ; that she is a clever , insinuating , handsome woman , poor and plausible , and altogether such in situation and manner , as to give a general idea , among Sir Walter 's acquaintance , of her meaning to be Lady Elliot , and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently , blind to the danger . """
William Elliot	"Here Mrs Smith paused a moment ; but Anne had not a word to say , and she continued-- "" This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family , long before you returned to it ; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it , though he did not then visit in Camden Place ; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there , and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two , as he happened to do a little before Christmas , Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things , and the reports beginning to prevail ."
William Elliot	Now you are to understand , that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot 's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy .
William Elliot	Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man .
William Elliot	Having long had as much money as he could spend , nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence , he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to .
William Elliot	He can not bear the idea of not being Sir William .
William Elliot	You may guess , therefore , that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable , and you may guess what it produced ; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible , and of fixing himself here for a time , with the view of renewing his former acquaintance , and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger , and of circumventing the lady if he found it material .
William Elliot	Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re - admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ) , to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject .
William Elliot	You can imagine what an artful man would do ; and with this guide , perhaps , may recollect what you have seen him do .
William Elliot	I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot , who would have difficulty in believing it ; but I have never been satisfied .
William Elliot	"I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared . I should like to know his present opinion , as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of ; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not . "" "" Lessening , I understand , "" replied Mrs Smith ."
William Elliot	""" He thinks Mrs Clay afraid of him , aware that he sees through her , and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence . But since he must be absent some time or other , I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence ."
William Elliot	Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea , as nurse tells me , that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry , that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay .
William Elliot	` Why , to be sure , ma'am , ' said she , ` it would not prevent his marrying anybody else .
William Elliot	And , indeed , to own the truth , I do not think nurse , in her heart , is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter 's making a second match . She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony , you know ; and ( since self will intrude ) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot , through Mrs Wallis 's recommendation ?
William Elliot	""" It will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him , but I shall know better what to do ."
William Elliot	Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous , artificial , worldly man , who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness .
William Elliot	But Mr Elliot was not done with .
William Elliot	Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion . She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot 's marriage ) they had been as before always together , and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune .
William Elliot	Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself , and was most tender of throwing any on her husband ; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living , and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance . From his wife 's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings , easy temper , careless habits , and not strong understanding , much more amiable than his friend , and very unlike him , led by him , and probably despised by him .
William Elliot	Mr Elliot , raised by his marriage to great affluence , and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself , ( for with all his self - indulgence he had become a prudent man ) , and beginning to be rich , just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor , seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend 's probable finances , but , on the contrary , had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin ; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined .
William Elliot	The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it .
William Elliot	They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends , and to prove that Mr Elliot 's had better not be tried ; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known .
William Elliot	With a confidence in Mr Elliot 's regard , more creditable to his feelings than his judgement , Mr Smith had appointed him the executor of his will ; but Mr Elliot would not act , and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her , in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation , had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit , or listened to without corresponding indignation .
William Elliot	Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion , answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith , which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble , and , under a cold civility , the same hard - hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her .
William Elliot	She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies , which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances , might be recoverable by proper measures ; and this property , though not large , would be enough to make her comparatively rich .
William Elliot	Mr Elliot would do nothing , and she could do nothing herself , equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness , and from employing others by her want of money .
William Elliot	To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances , that a little trouble in the right place might do it , and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims , was hard to bear . It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne 's good offices with Mr Elliot .
William Elliot	She had previously , in the anticipation of their marriage , been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it ; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature , since he did not even know her to be in Bath , it immediately occurred , that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved , and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne 's feelings , as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot 's character would allow , when Anne 's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything ; and while it took from her the new - formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety , left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way . After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot , Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith 's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation .
William Elliot	""" She had seemed to recommend and praise him ! """
William Elliot	I considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and I could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband .
William Elliot	My heart bled for you , as I talked of happiness ; and yet he is sensible , he is agreeable , and with such a woman as you , it was not absolutely hopeless .
William Elliot	He was very unkind to his first wife .
William Elliot	But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect , and he had never loved her .
William Elliot	""" Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed . It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell !"
William Elliot	It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived ; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference , which carried them through the greater part of the morning , was , that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Smith , in which his conduct was involved .
William Elliot	Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith , and Anne therefore lost no time in going .
William Elliot	She had been the only one of the set absent , for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship 's service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot ; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early , and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her . Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell .
William Elliot	To her , its greatest interest must be , in having been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot ; in having been wished for , regretted , and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause .
William Elliot	Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot . He thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence . He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits ; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend , could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man , without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create . Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot .
William Elliot	She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her , and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood , and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing .
William Elliot	She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject , she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter , of a possible attachment on his side , of the desirableness of the alliance , supposing such attachment to be real and returned .
William Elliot	I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together .
William Elliot	""" Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man , and in many respects I think highly of him , "" said Anne ; "" but we should not suit . """
William Elliot	"The idea of becoming what her mother had been ; of having the precious name of "" Lady Elliot "" first revived in herself ; of being restored to Kellynch , calling it her home again , her home for ever , was a charm which she could not immediately resist . Lady Russell said not another word , willing to leave the matter to its own operation ; and believing that , could Mr Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed , in short , what Anne did not believe ."
William Elliot	The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself brought Anne to composure again .
William Elliot	She never could accept him .
William Elliot	And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one ; her judgement , on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against Mr Elliot .
William Elliot	Though they had now been acquainted a month , she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character .
William Elliot	That he was a sensible man , an agreeable man , that he talked well , professed good opinions , seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle , this was all clear enough .
William Elliot	He certainly knew what was right , nor could she fix
William Elliot	on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed ; but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct .
William Elliot	The names which occasionally dropt of former associates , the allusions to former practices and pursuits , suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been .
William Elliot	She saw that there had been bad habits ; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing ; that there had been a period of his life ( and probably not a short one ) when he had been , at least , careless in all serious matters ; and , though he might now think very differently , who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever , cautious man , grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ? How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ? Mr Elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open . There was never any burst of feeling , any warmth of indignation or delight , at the evil or good of others . This , to Anne , was a decided imperfection .
William Elliot	Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable .
William Elliot	Various as were the tempers in her father 's house , he pleased them all .
William Elliot	He endured too well , stood too well with every body .
William Elliot	He had spoken to her with some degree of openness of Mrs Clay ; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was about , and to hold her in contempt ; and yet Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body . Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend , for she saw nothing to excite distrust . She could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot ; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church , in the course of the following autumn .
William Elliot	I can not pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine -- I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it ; and then ` Miss Elliot ' was spoken of in the highest terms !
William Elliot	there was no end of Miss Elliot 's charms .
William Elliot	Mary spoke with animation of their meeting with , or rather missing , Mr Elliot so extraordinarily .
William Elliot	""" He is a man , "" said Lady Russell , "" whom I have no wish to see ."
William Elliot	"His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family , has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me . "" This decision checked Mary 's eagerness , and stopped her short in the midst of the Elliot countenance ."
William Elliot	Mr Elliot was in Bath .
William Elliot	He had called in Camden Place ; had called a second time , a third ; had been pointedly attentive .
William Elliot	If Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves , had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance , and proclaim the value of the connection , as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect .
William Elliot	"This was very wonderful if it were true ; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot , already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary , of his being "" a man whom she had no wish to see . """
William Elliot	She had a great wish to see him .
William Elliot	If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch , he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree . Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance , but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not , which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath .
William Elliot	In one point , her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot .
William Elliot	There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him .
William Elliot	He stood as opposed to Captain Wentworth , in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness ; and the evil of his attentions last night , the irremediable mischief he might have done , was considered with sensations unqualified , unperplexed .
William Elliot	Pity for him was all over . But this was the only point of relief .
William Elliot	She was concerned for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling ; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister , and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils , without knowing how to avert any one of them . She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him .
William Elliot	She found , on reaching home , that she had , as she intended , escaped seeing Mr Elliot ; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit ; but hardly had she congratulated herself , and felt safe , when she heard that he was coming again in the evening .
William Elliot	""" I had not the smallest intention of asking him , "" said Elizabeth , with affected carelessness , "" but he gave so many hints ; so Mrs Clay says , at least . "" "" Indeed , I do say it ."
William Elliot	Poor man !
William Elliot	"I was really in pain for him ; for your hard - hearted sister , Miss Anne , seems bent on cruelty . "" "" Oh ! "" cried Elizabeth , "" I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman 's hints ."
William Elliot	However , when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning , I gave way immediately , for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together .
William Elliot	Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect .
William Elliot	But , upon my word , I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men .
William Elliot	""" Well , my dear Penelope , you need not be so alarmed about him ."
William Elliot	I did invite him , you know .
William Elliot	I sent him away with smiles .
William Elliot	When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to - morrow , I had compassion on him .
William Elliot	It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight of Mr Elliot ; and yet she could assume a most obliging , placid look , and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done otherwise .
William Elliot	To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room ; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her .
William Elliot	She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere , but now she saw insincerity in everything .
William Elliot	His attentive deference to her father , contrasted with his former language , was odious ; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith , she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness , or the sound of his artificial good sentiments . She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side . It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat ; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship ; and to retrace , as quietly as she could , the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along . She was accordingly more guarded , and more cool , than she had been the night before .
William Elliot	He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised ; wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation ; but the charm was broken
William Elliot	: he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin 's vanity ; he found , at least , that it was not to be done now , by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too - commanding claims of the others . He little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest , bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable .
William Elliot	She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath the next morning , going early , and that he would be gone the greater part of two days .
William Elliot	He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of his return ; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain .
William Elliot	It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her ; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party , seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort . It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and Elizabeth ; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them ! Mrs Clay 's selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his ; and Anne would have compounded for the marriage at once , with all its evils , to be clear of Mr Elliot 's subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it .
William Elliot	Anne , remembering the preconcerted visits , at all hours , of Mr Elliot , would have expected him , but for his known engagement seven miles off .
William Elliot	"Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ? "" He answered rather hesitatingly , "" Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different . If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab - chick in the water ; and Benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long ."
William Elliot	""" That can not be much to your taste , I know , "" said she ; "" but I do believe him to be an excellent young man ."
William Elliot	She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot , and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , who were fortunately already engaged to come ; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention .
William Elliot	Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings ; she had derived from it a delightful conviction ; but she feared from his looks , that the same unfortunate persuasion , which had hastened him away from the Concert Room , still governed .
William Elliot	He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation .
William Elliot	"It is Mr Elliot himself . "" "" No , "" cried Anne , quickly , "" it can not be Mr Elliot , I assure you ."
William Elliot	"He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to - morrow . "" As she spoke , she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her , the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her , and made her regret that she had said so much , simple as it was . Mary , resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin , began talking very warmly about the family features , and protesting still more positively that it was Mr Elliot , calling again upon Anne to come and look for herself , but Anne did not mean to stir , and tried to be cool and unconcerned ."
William Elliot	He is turning away .
William Elliot	Not know Mr Elliot , indeed !
William Elliot	"She was just in time to ascertain that it really was Mr Elliot , which she had never believed , before he disappeared on one side , as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other ; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest , she calmly said , "" Yes , it is Mr Elliot , certainly . He has changed his hour of going , I suppose , that is all , or I may be mistaken , I might not attend ; "" and walked back to her chair , recomposed , and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well ."
William Elliot	Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to - morrow night ? and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter , and Mr Elliot , and all the principal family connexions , on purpose to be introduced to them ?
William Elliot	We are quite near relations , you know ; and Mr Elliot too , whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with !
William Elliot	Every attention is due to Mr Elliot .
William Elliot	"What is Mr Elliot to me ? """
William Elliot	The careless expression was life to Anne , who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention , looking and listening with his whole soul ; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself . Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style ; he , half serious and half jesting , maintaining the scheme for the play , and she , invariably serious , most warmly opposing it , and not omitting to make it known that , however determined to go to Camden Place herself , she should not think herself very well used , if they went to the play without her . Mrs Musgrove interposed .
William Elliot	Captain Wentworth left his seat , and walked to the fire - place ; probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards , and taking a station , with less bare - faced design , by Anne .
William Elliot	""" You have not been long enough in Bath , "" said he , "" to enjoy the evening parties of the place . "" "" Oh !"
William Elliot	""" "" You were not formerly , I know . You did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes ."
William Elliot	"After waiting a few moments he said , and as if it were the result of immediate feeling , "" It is a period , indeed !"
William Elliot	Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne 's imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour ; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered , she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta , eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out , and calling on her companions to lose no time , lest somebody else should come in .
William Elliot	Anne talked of being perfectly ready , and tried to look it ; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair , in preparing to quit the room , she would have found , in all her own sensations for her cousin , in the very security of his affection , wherewith to pity her . Their preparations , however , were stopped short .
William Elliot	Captain Wentworth was acknowledged again by each , by Elizabeth more graciously than before .
William Elliot	She even addressed him once , and looked at him more than once .
William Elliot	"It was all said very gracefully , and the cards with which she had provided herself , the "" Miss Elliot at home , "" were laid on the table , with a courteous , comprehensive smile to all , and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth ."
William Elliot	The truth was , that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his .
William Elliot	The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about well in her drawing - room . The card was pointedly given , and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared .
William Elliot	The interruption had been short , though severe , and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out , but not to Anne . She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed , and of the manner in which it had been received ; a manner of doubtful meaning , of surprise rather than gratification , of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance . She knew him ; she saw disdain in his eye , and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering , as an atonement for all the insolence of the past . Her spirits sank .
William Elliot	He held the card in his hand after they were gone , as if deeply considering it .
William Elliot	""" I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted !"
William Elliot	"You see he can not put the card out of his hand . """
William Elliot	Anne caught his eye , saw his cheeks glow , and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt , and turned away , that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her .
William Elliot	Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning , therefore , she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place , there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow 's party , the frequent enumeration of the persons invited , and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath , while harassing herself with the never - ending question , of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not ?
William Elliot	They were reckoning him as certain , but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together .
William Elliot	She generally thought he would come , because she generally thought he ought ; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion , as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings .
William Elliot	She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation , to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath , for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself , she determined to mention it , and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs Clay 's face as she listened .
William Elliot	It was transient : cleared away in an instant ; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having , by some complication of mutual trick , or some overbearing authority of his , been obliged to attend ( perhaps for half an hour ) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter .
William Elliot	Only think , Miss Elliot , to my great surprise I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street .
William Elliot	He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard .
William Elliot	He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return .
William Elliot	He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to - morrow .
William Elliot	He was full of ` to - morrow , ' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have
William Elliot	I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable , and wish I could be acquainted with him too ; but I have my usual luck : I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on ; always the last of my family to be noticed .
William Elliot	Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay .
William Elliot	It began to rain , not much , but enough to make shelter desirable for women , and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple 's carriage , which was seen waiting at a little distance ; she , Anne , and Mrs Clay , therefore , turned into Molland 's , while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple , to request her assistance .
William Elliot	He soon joined them again , successful , of course ; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home , and would call for them in a few minutes . Her ladyship 's carriage was a barouche , and did not hold more than four with any comfort . Miss Carteret was with her mother ; consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden Place ladies . There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot . Whoever suffered inconvenience , she must suffer none , but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two .
William Elliot	The rain was a mere trifle , and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot .
William Elliot	much thicker than Miss Anne 's ; and , in short , her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be , and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined , that the others were obliged to settle it for them ; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already , and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal ,
William Elliot	that his cousin Anne 's boots were rather the thickest .
William Elliot	For a few minutes she saw nothing before her ; it was all confusion . She was lost , and when she had scolded back her senses , she found the others still waiting for the carriage , and Mr Elliot ( always obliging ) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs Clay 's . She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door ; she wanted to see if it rained .
William Elliot	"After a moment 's pause he said : "" Though I came only yesterday , I have equipped myself properly for Bath already , you see , "" ( pointing to a new umbrella ) ; "" I wish you would make use of it , if you are determined to walk ; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair . "" She was very much obliged to him , but declined it all , repeating her conviction , that the rain would come to nothing at present , and adding , "" I am only waiting for Mr Elliot ."
William Elliot	"He will be here in a moment , I am sure . """
William Elliot	She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in .
William Elliot	Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly .
William Elliot	""" Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin , I fancy ?"
William Elliot	"One can guess what will happen there . He is always with them ; half lives in the family , I believe . What a very good - looking man ! "" "" Yes , and Miss Atkinson , who dined with him once at the Wallises , says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with ."
William Elliot	""" Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin , if he would have walked by her side all the way to Camden Place , without saying a word ."
William Elliot	23 One day only had passed since Anne 's conversation with Mrs Smith ; but a keener interest had succeeded , and she was now so little touched by Mr Elliot 's conduct , except by its effects in one quarter , that it became a matter of course the next morning , still to defer her explanatory visit in Rivers Street . She had promised to be with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner .
William Elliot	Her faith was plighted , and Mr Elliot 's character , like the Sultaness Scheherazade 's head , must live another day .
William Elliot	Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment . That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four - and - twenty hours . It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks , or words , or actions occasionally encouraged ; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville ; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper , and poured out his feelings .
William Elliot	Of what he had then written , nothing was to be retracted or qualified .
William Elliot	He persisted in having loved none but her .
William Elliot	He never even believed himself to see her equal .
William Elliot	Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge : that he had been constant unconsciously , nay unintentionally ; that he had meant to forget her , and believed it to be done .
William Elliot	The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused him , and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville 's had fixed her superiority .
William Elliot	"The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him : the moment of Mr Elliot 's appearing and tearing her away , and one or two subsequent moments , marked by returning hope or increasing despondency , were dwelt on with energy . """
William Elliot	"Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you , was not the recollection of what had been , the knowledge of her influence , the indelible , immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done-- was it not all against me ? "" "" You should have distinguished , "" replied Anne ."
William Elliot	""" You should not have suspected me now ; the case is so different , and my age is so different ."
William Elliot	""" I should have thought , "" said Anne , "" that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this ."
William Elliot	Mr Elliot was there ; she avoided , but she could pity him .
William Elliot	They had Mr Elliot too .
William Elliot	Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot .
William Elliot	He was not only pardoned , they were delighted with him .
William Elliot	He had been in Bath about a fortnight ; ( he had passed through Bath in November , in his way to London , when the intelligence of Sir Walter 's being settled there had of course reached him , though only twenty - four hours in the place , but he had not been able to avail himself of it ;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath , and his first object on arriving , had been to leave his card in Camden Place , following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet , and when they did meet , by such great openness of conduct , such readiness to apologize for the past , such solicitude to be received as a relation again , that their former good understanding was completely re - established .
William Elliot	They had not a fault to find in him .
William Elliot	He had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side .
William Elliot	He had never had an idea of throwing himself off ; he had feared that he was thrown off , but knew not why , and delicacy had kept him silent .
William Elliot	Upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours , he was quite indignant .
William Elliot	He was astonished , indeed , but his character and general conduct must refute it .
William Elliot	He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him ; and certainly , the pains he had been taking on this , the first opportunity of reconciliation , to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir - presumptive , was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject .
William Elliot	The circumstances of his marriage , too , were found to admit of much extenuation . This was an article not to be entered on by himself ; but a very intimate friend of his , a Colonel Wallis , a highly respectable man , perfectly the gentleman , ( and not an ill - looking man , Sir Walter added ) , who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings , and had , at his own particular request , been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot , had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage , which made a material difference in the discredit of it . Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long , had been well acquainted also with his wife , had perfectly understood the whole story .
William Elliot	Without that attraction , not all her money would have tempted Elliot , and Sir Walter was , moreover , assured of her having been a very fine woman . Here was a great deal to soften the business .
William Elliot	Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology ; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light , she allowed it be a great extenuation . Mr Elliot had called repeatedly , had dined with them once , evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked , for they gave no dinners in general ; delighted , in short , by every proof of cousinly notice , and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place .
William Elliot	All that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators . Still , however , she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared , in Mr Elliot 's wishing , after an interval of so many years , to be well received by them .
William Elliot	In a worldly view , he had nothing to gain by being on terms with Sir Walter ; nothing to risk by a state of variance .
William Elliot	In all probability he was already the richer of the two , and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title .
William Elliot	A sensible man , and he had looked like a very sensible man , why should it be an object to him ? She could only offer one solution ; it was , perhaps , for Elizabeth 's sake .
William Elliot	There might really have been a liking formerly , though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way ; and now that he could afford to please himself , he might mean to pay his addresses to her . Elizabeth was certainly very handsome , with well - bred , elegant manners , and her character might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot , knowing her but in public , and when very young himself .
William Elliot	How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one . Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if Elizabeth were his object ; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while Mr Elliot 's frequent visits were talked of . Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme , but without being much attended to .
William Elliot	yes , perhaps , it had been Mr Elliot .
William Elliot	"It might be him , perhaps . """
William Elliot	They could not listen to her description of him .
William Elliot	They were describing him themselves ; Sir Walter especially .
William Elliot	"Mr Elliot appeared to think that he ( Sir Walter ) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted ; "" but Sir Walter had "" not been able to return the compliment entirely , which had embarrassed him ."
William Elliot	"Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men , and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere . """
William Elliot	Mr Elliot , and his friends in Marlborough Buildings , were talked of the whole evening .
William Elliot	""" Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them ! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should ! """
William Elliot	"and there was a Mrs Wallis , at present known only to them by description , as she was in daily expectation of her confinement ; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as "" a most charming woman , quite worthy of being known in Camden Place , "" and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted ."
William Elliot	"It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable , by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced . He had never walked anywhere arm - in - arm with Colonel Wallis ( who was a fine military figure , though sandy - haired ) without observing that every woman 's eye was upon him ; every woman 's eye was sure to be upon Colonel Wallis . "" Modest Sir Walter !"
William Elliot	It was ten o'clock . Could it be Mr Elliot ?
William Elliot	They knew he was to dine in Lansdown Crescent .
William Elliot	It was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did .
William Elliot	"Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot 's knock . """
William Elliot	With all the state which a butler and foot - boy could give , Mr Elliot was ushered into the room .
William Elliot	It was the same , the very same man , with no difference but of dress .
William Elliot	"Anne drew a little back , while the others received his compliments , and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour , but "" he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before , "" & c. & c ; which was all as politely done , and as politely taken , as possible , but her part must follow then . Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter ; "" Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter "" ( there was no occasion for remembering Mary ) ; and Anne , smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was ."
William Elliot	He looked completely astonished , but not more astonished than pleased ; his eyes brightened !
William Elliot	and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship , alluded to the past , and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already . He was quite as good - looking as he had appeared at Lyme , his countenance improved by speaking , and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be , so polished , so easy , so particularly agreeable , that she could compare them in excellence to only one person 's manners .
William Elliot	They were not the same , but they were , perhaps , equally good . He sat down with them , and improved their conversation very much . There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man . Ten minutes were enough to certify that . His tone , his expressions , his choice of subject , his knowing where to stop ; it was all the operation of a sensible , discerning mind .
William Elliot	As soon as he could , he began to talk to her of Lyme , wanting to compare opinions respecting the place , but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time ; to give his own route , understand something of hers , and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her .
William Elliot	She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme .
William Elliot	His regret increased as he listened .
William Elliot	He had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs ; had heard voices , mirth continually ; thought they must be a most delightful set of people , longed to be with them , but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself .
William Elliot	If he had but asked who the party were !
William Elliot	The name of Musgrove would have told him enough .
William Elliot	""" Well , it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn , which he had adopted , when quite a young man , on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious ."
William Elliot	""" The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty , "" said he , "" as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing , are more absurd , I believe , than those of any other set of beings in the world ."
William Elliot	"The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view . "" But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone : he knew it ; he was soon diffused again among the others , and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme ."
William Elliot	His enquiries , however , produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there , soon after his leaving the place .
William Elliot	"Having alluded to "" an accident , "" he must hear the whole ."
William Elliot	When he questioned , Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also , but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt .
William Elliot	She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell , in the wish of really comprehending what had passed , and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it .
William Elliot	He staid an hour with them .
William Elliot	"The elegant little clock on the mantel- piece had struck "" eleven with its silver sounds , "" and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale , before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long ."
William Elliot	""" Yes , Sir , a Mr Elliot , a gentleman of large fortune , came in last night from Sidmouth ."
William Elliot	Dare say you heard the carriage , sir , while you were at dinner ; and going on now for Crewkherne , in his way to Bath and London .
William Elliot	""" Elliot ! """
William Elliot	"Many had looked on each other , and many had repeated the name , before all this had been got through , even by the smart rapidity of a waiter . "" Bless me ! "" cried Mary ; "" it must be our cousin ; it must be our Mr Elliot , it must , indeed ! Charles , Anne , must not it ? In mourning , you see , just as our Mr Elliot must be ."
William Elliot	Anne , must not it be our Mr Elliot ? my father 's next heir ?
William Elliot	"Pray sir , "" turning to the waiter , "" did not you hear , did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynch family ?"
William Elliot	""" No , ma'am , he did not mention no particular family ; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman , and would be a baronight some day ."
William Elliot	Heir to Sir Walter Elliot !
William Elliot	Depend upon it , that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish , wherever he goes .
William Elliot	I wish I had looked at him more .
William Elliot	I wish we had been aware in time , who it was , that he might have been introduced to us .
William Elliot	Do you think he had the Elliot countenance ?
William Elliot	I hardly looked at him , I was looking at the horses ; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance , I wonder the arms did not strike me !
William Elliot	""" Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together , "" said Captain Wentworth , "" we must consider it to be the arrangement of Providence , that you should not be introduced to your cousin . """
William Elliot	When she could command Mary 's attention , Anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not , for many years , been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable .
William Elliot	At the same time , however , it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin , and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman , and had an air of good sense .
William Elliot	""" Of course , "" said Mary , "" you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot , the next time you write to Bath ."
William Elliot	"I think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him . "" Anne avoided a direct reply , but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated , but as what ought to be suppressed . The offence which had been given her father , many years back , she knew ; Elizabeth 's particular share in it she suspected ; and that Mr Elliot 's idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt ."
William Elliot	""" Miss Elliot , "" said he , speaking rather low , "" you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much ."
William Elliot	I wish he could have such company oftener .
William Elliot	It is bad for him , I know , to be shut up as he is ; but what can we do ?
William Elliot	""" No , "" said Anne , "" that I can easily believe to be impossible ; but in time , perhaps -- we know what time does in every case of affliction , and you must remember , Captain Harville , that your friend may yet be called a young mourner -- only last summer , I understand ."
William Elliot	""" Ay , true enough , "" ( with a deep sigh ) "" only June . "" "" And not known to him , perhaps , so soon . "" "" Not till the first week of August , when he came home from the Cape , just made into the Grappler ."
William Elliot	I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him ; he sent in letters , but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth .
William Elliot	"Nobody could do it , but that good fellow "" ( pointing to Captain Wentworth . ) "" The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before ; no danger of her being sent to sea again ."
William Elliot	He stood his chance for the rest ; wrote up for leave of absence , but without waiting the return , travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth , rowed off to the Grappler that instant , and never left the poor fellow for a week .
William Elliot	That 's what he did , and nobody else could have saved poor James .
William Elliot	"You may think , Miss Elliot , whether he is dear to us ! "" Anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different . Mrs Harville 's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home , determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk ; they would accompany them to their door , and then return and set off themselves ."
William Elliot	"He caught the word ; it seemed to rouse him at once , and saying only-- "" True , true , a surgeon this instant , "" was darting away , when Anne eagerly suggested-- "" Captain Benwick , would not it be better for Captain Benwick ? He knows where a surgeon is to be found . "" Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea , and in a moment ( it was all done in rapid moments ) Captain Benwick had resigned the poor corpse - like figure entirely to the brother 's care , and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity ."
William Elliot	"Musgrove , either you or I must go . """
William Elliot	""" Then it is settled , Musgrove , "" cried Captain Wentworth , "" that you stay , and that I take care of your sister home ."
William Elliot	Though it was rather desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay ; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take them back , would be a dreadful extension of suspense ; and Captain Wentworth proposed , and Charles Musgrove agreed , that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn , and leave Mr Musgrove 's carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early , when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa 's night . Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part , and to be soon followed by the two ladies .
William Elliot	Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of Mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , Charles taking care of his sister , and Captain Benwick attending to her . She gave a moment 's recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . There she had listened to Henrietta 's schemes for Dr Shirley 's leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen Mr Elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa , or those who were wrapt up in her welfare . Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance .
Sir Walter Elliot	Sir Walter , his two daughters , and Mrs Clay , were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening ; and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for , they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room .
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Lady Dalrymple , Lady Dalrymple , "" was the rejoicing sound ; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance , Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her . Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , escorted by Mr Elliot and Colonel Wallis , who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant , advanced into the room . The others joined them , and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included . She was divided from Captain Wentworth ."
Sir Walter Elliot	""" A well - looking man , "" said Sir Walter , "" a very well - looking man . """
Sir Walter Elliot	"His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire , the Croft , who rents Kellynch . "" Before Sir Walter had reached this point , Anne 's eyes had caught the right direction , and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance ."
Sir Walter Elliot	The baronet , nevertheless , is not unlikely to marry again ; he is quite fool enough .
Sir Walter Elliot	If he does , however , they will leave me in peace , which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion .
Sir Walter Elliot	He is worse than last year .
Sir Walter Elliot	1 Sir Walter Elliot , of Kellynch Hall , in Somersetshire , was a man who , for his own amusement , never took up any book but the Baronetage ; there he found occupation for an idle hour , and consolation in a distressed one ; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect , by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents ; there any unwelcome sensations , arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century ; and there , if every other leaf were powerless , he could read his own history with an interest which never failed .
Sir Walter Elliot	Walter Elliot , born March 1 , 1760 , married , July 15 , 1784 , Elizabeth , daughter of James Stevenson , Esq . of South Park , in the county of Gloucester , by which lady ( who died 1800 ) he has issue Elizabeth , born June 1 , 1785 ; Anne , born August 9 , 1787 ; a still - born son , November 5 , 1789 ; Mary , born November 20 , 1791 .
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer 's hands ; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding , for the information of himself and his family , these words , after the date of Mary 's birth-- "" Married , December 16 , 1810 , Charles , son and heir of Charles Musgrove , Esq . of Uppercross , in the county of Somerset , "" and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife"
Sir Walter Elliot	"Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in Cheshire ; how mentioned in Dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of Charles II , with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto:--""Principal seat , Kellynch Hall , in the county of Somerset , "" and Sir Walter 's handwriting again in this finale:-- "" Heir presumptive , William Walter Elliot , Esq . , great grandson of the second Sir Walter . """
Sir Walter Elliot	He had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty - four , was still a very fine man .
Sir Walter Elliot	Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did , nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society . He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy ; and the Sir Walter Elliot , who united these gifts , was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion
Sir Walter Elliot	His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment ; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own .
Sir Walter Elliot	Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman , sensible and amiable ; whose judgement and conduct , if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot , had never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured , or softened , or concealed his failings , and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years ; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself , had found enough in her duties , her friends , and her children , to attach her to life , and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them .
Sir Walter Elliot	--Three girls , the two eldest sixteen and fourteen , was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath , an awful charge rather , to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited , silly father . She had , however , one very intimate friend , a sensible , deserving woman , who had been brought , by strong attachment to herself , to settle close by her , in the village of Kellynch ; and on her kindness and advice , Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters .
Sir Walter Elliot	had passed away since Lady Elliot 's death , and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends , and one remained a widower , the other a widow .
Sir Walter Elliot	For one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do . Elizabeth had succeeded , at sixteen , to all that was possible , of her mother 's rights and consequence ; and being very handsome , and very like himself , her influence had always been great , and they had gone on together most happily .
Sir Walter Elliot	Mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove ; but Anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister
Sir Walter Elliot	; her word had no weight , her convenience was always to give way-- she was only Anne .
Sir Walter Elliot	To Lady Russell , indeed , she was a most dear and highly valued god - daughter , favourite , and friend .
Sir Walter Elliot	Lady Russell loved them all ; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again .
Sir Walter Elliot	A few years before , Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl , but her bloom had vanished early ; and as even in its height ,
Sir Walter Elliot	All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably .
Sir Walter Elliot	It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty - nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost . It was so with Elizabeth , still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and Sir Walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing .
Sir Walter Elliot	Anne haggard , Mary coarse , every face in the neighbourhood worsting , and the rapid increase of the crow 's foot about Lady Russell 's temples had long been a distress to him .
Sir Walter Elliot	Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment .
Sir Walter Elliot	Thirteen winters ' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded , and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms , as she travelled up to London with her father , for a few weeks ' annual enjoyment of the great world . She had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine - and - twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions ; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever , but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet - blood within the next twelvemonth or two . Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth , but now she liked it not .
Sir Walter Elliot	Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister , made the book an evil ; and more than once , when her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away . She had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of .
Sir Walter Elliot	The heir presumptive , the very William Walter Elliot , Esq . , whose rights had been so generously supported by her father , had disappointed her .
Sir Walter Elliot	She had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should . He had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after Lady Elliot 's death , Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing - back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to London , when Elizabeth was in her first bloom , Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction .
Sir Walter Elliot	This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still , after an interval of several years , felt with anger by Elizabeth , who had liked the man for himself , and still more for being her father 's heir , and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot 's eldest daughter . There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal .
Sir Walter Elliot	Yet so miserably had he conducted himself , that though she was at this present time ( the summer of 1814 ) wearing black ribbons for his wife , she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again .
Sir Walter Elliot	The disgrace of his first marriage might , perhaps , as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring , have been got over , had he not done worse ; but he had , as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends , they had been informed , spoken most disrespectfully of them all , most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to , and the honours which were hereafter to be his own . This could not be pardoned .
Sir Walter Elliot	Such were Elizabeth Elliot 's sentiments and sensations ; such the cares to alloy , the agitations to vary , the sameness and the elegance , the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life ; such the feelings to give interest to a long , uneventful residence in one country circle , to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad , no talents or accomplishments for home , to occupy . But now , another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these .
Sir Walter Elliot	She knew , that when he now took up the Baronetage , it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople , and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd , his agent , from his thoughts .
Sir Walter Elliot	The Kellynch property was good , but not equal to Sir Walter 's apprehension of the state required in its possessor . While Lady Elliot lived , there had been method , moderation , and economy , which had just kept him within his income ; but with her had died all such right - mindedness , and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it .
Sir Walter Elliot	"He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town ; he had gone so far even as to say , "" Can we retrench ?"
Sir Walter Elliot	"Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench ? "" and Elizabeth , to do her justice , had , in the first ardour of female alarm , set seriously to think what could be done , and had finally proposed these two branches of economy , to cut off some unnecessary charities , and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing - room ; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne , as had been the usual yearly custom . But these measures , however good in themselves , were insufficient for the real extent of the evil , the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards ."
Sir Walter Elliot	Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy .
Sir Walter Elliot	There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of ; but had every acre been alienable , it would have made no difference .
Sir Walter Elliot	He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power , but he would never condescend to sell .
Sir Walter Elliot	No ; he would never disgrace his name so far .
Sir Walter Elliot	Their two confidential friends , Mr Shepherd , who lived in the neighbouring market town , and Lady Russell , were called to advise them ; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure , without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride .
Sir Walter Elliot	17 While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in Laura Place , Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description .
Sir Walter Elliot	Sir Walter , Elizabeth and Mrs Clay , returned one morning from Laura Place , with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening , and Anne was already engaged , to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings .
Sir Walter Elliot	"They were not much interested in anything relative to Anne ; but still there were questions enough asked , to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was ; and Elizabeth was disdainful , and Sir Walter severe . "" Westgate Buildings ! "" said he , "" and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be visiting in Westgate Buildings ?"
Sir Walter Elliot	Upon my word , Miss Anne Elliot , you have the most extraordinary taste !
Sir Walter Elliot	But surely you may put off this old lady till to - morrow : she is not so near her end , I presume , but that she may hope to see another day .
Sir Walter Elliot	""" "" No , sir , she is not one - and - thirty ; but I do not think I can put off my engagement , because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself ."
Sir Walter Elliot	She goes into the warm bath to - morrow , and for the rest of the week , you know , we are engaged .
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement , "" observed Sir Walter ."
Sir Walter Elliot	She had been the only one of the set absent , for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship 's service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot ; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early , and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her . Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell .
Sir Walter Elliot	However , when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning , I gave way immediately , for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together .
Sir Walter Elliot	It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight of Mr Elliot ; and yet she could assume a most obliging , placid look , and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done otherwise .
Sir Walter Elliot	"and she sits so upright ! My best love , of course . "" "" And mine , "" added Sir Walter ."
Sir Walter Elliot	And you may say , that I mean to call upon her soon .
Sir Walter Elliot	Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card . Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life , who make themselves up so little . If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen ; but last time I called , I observed the blinds were let down immediately .
Sir Walter Elliot	"After the usual period of suspense , the usual sounds of approach were heard , and "" Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove "" were ushered into the room . Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance ; but Anne was really glad to see them ; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome ; and as soon as it became clear that these , their nearest relations , were not arrived with an views of accommodation in that house , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality , and do the honours of it very well ."
Sir Walter Elliot	They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove , and were at the White Hart . So much was pretty soon understood ; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing - room , and regaling themselves with her admiration , Anne could not draw upon Charles 's brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary , as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of .
Sir Walter Elliot	Alarming sounds were heard ; other visitors approached , and the door was thrown open for Sir Walter and Miss Elliot , whose entrance seemed to give a general chill .
Sir Walter Elliot	The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about well in her drawing - room . The card was pointedly given , and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared .
Sir Walter Elliot	It was transient : cleared away in an instant ; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having , by some complication of mutual trick , or some overbearing authority of his , been obliged to attend ( perhaps for half an hour ) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter .
Sir Walter Elliot	Mr Shepherd , a civil , cautious lawyer , who , whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter , would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else , excused himself from offering the slightest hint , and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell , from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted .
Sir Walter Elliot	She was of strict integrity herself , with a delicate sense of honour ; but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter 's feelings , as solicitous for the credit of the family , as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them , as anybody of sense and honesty could well be . She was a benevolent , charitable , good woman , and capable of strong attachments , most correct in her conduct , strict in her notions of decorum , and with manners that were held a standard of good - breeding .
Sir Walter Elliot	She had a cultivated mind , and was , generally speaking , rational and consistent ; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry ; she had a value for rank and consequence , which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them . Herself the widow of only a knight , she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due ; and Sir Walter , independent of his claims as an old acquaintance , an attentive neighbour , an obliging landlord , the husband of her very dear friend , the father of Anne and her sisters , was , as being Sir Walter , in her apprehension , entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties . They must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt .
Sir Walter Elliot	But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth .
Sir Walter Elliot	She consulted , and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter .
Sir Walter Elliot	""" If we can persuade your father to all this , "" said Lady Russell , looking over her paper , "" much may be done ."
Sir Walter Elliot	If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth , that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which can not be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle .
Sir Walter Elliot	"What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ? There will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct . I have great hope of prevailing . We must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man . "" This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him . She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure , and saw no dignity in anything short of it . She wanted it to be prescribed , and felt as a duty . She rated Lady Russell 's influence highly ; and as to the severe degree of self - denial which her own conscience prompted , she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete , than to half a reformation ."
Sir Walter Elliot	Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both , and so on , through the whole list of Lady Russell 's too gentle reductions .
Sir Walter Elliot	"No , he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once , than remain in it on such disgraceful terms . "" "" Quit Kellynch Hall . """
Sir Walter Elliot	"The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd , whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter 's retrenching , and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode . "" Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate , he had no scruple , "" he said , "" in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side ."
Sir Walter Elliot	It did not appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support .
Sir Walter Elliot	In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself ; and would be looked up to , as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household .
Sir Walter Elliot	Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall ; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision , the great question of whither he should go was settled , and the first outline of this important change made out .
Sir Walter Elliot	Sir Walter had at first thought more of London ; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred .
Sir Walter Elliot	Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from Kellynch , only fifty miles , and Lady Russell 's spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell , whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there .
Sir Walter Elliot	It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood . Anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw , and to Sir Walter 's feelings they must have been dreadful .
Sir Walter Elliot	The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part , and a very material part of the scheme , which had been happily engrafted on the beginning . He was not only to quit his home , but to see it in the hands of others ; a trial of fortitude , which stronger heads than Sir Walter 's have found too much . Kellynch Hall was to be let .
Sir Walter Elliot	"Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house . Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word "" advertise , "" but never dared approach it again ."
Sir Walter Elliot	Sir Walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner ; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention ; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant , on his own terms , and as a great favour , that he would let it at all . How quick come the reasons for approving what we like !
Sir Walter Elliot	Lady Russell had another excellent one at hand , for being extremely glad that Sir Walter and his family were to remove from the country .
Sir Walter Elliot	It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd , who had returned , after an unprosperous marriage , to her father 's house , with the additional burden of two children . She was a clever young woman , who understood the art of pleasing -- the art of pleasing , at least , at Kellynch Hall ; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot , as to have been already staying there more than once , in spite of all that Lady Russell , who thought it a friendship quite out of place , could hint of caution and reserve .
Sir Walter Elliot	""" What is this ? "" cried Sir Walter ."
Sir Walter Elliot	"What have they brought you ? "" "" A letter from Uppercross Cottage , Sir ."
Sir Walter Elliot	"Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond . "" How is Mary ? "" said Elizabeth ; and without waiting for an answer ,"
Sir Walter Elliot	"said Sir Walter . "" Poor old gentleman . "" "" Have they any acquaintance here ? "" asked Elizabeth ."
Sir Walter Elliot	""" I suspect , "" said Sir Walter coolly , "" that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall ."
Sir Walter Elliot	There are several odd - looking men walking about here , who , I am told , are sailors .
Sir Walter Elliot	This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth 's share of interest in the letter ; when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove , and her fine little boys , Anne was at liberty . In her own room , she tried to comprehend it .
Sir Walter Elliot	The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street , perfectly to Sir Walter 's satisfaction . He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance , and did , in fact , think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral , than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him .
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Did you say that you had something to tell me , sir ? "" "" Yes , I have , presently ."
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Indeed you are mistaken there , sir ; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick 's manners ."
Sir Walter Elliot	"3 "" I must take leave to observe , Sir Walter , "" said Mr Shepherd one morning at Kellynch Hall , as he laid down the newspaper , "" that the present juncture is much in our favour ."
Sir Walter Elliot	Could not be a better time , Sir Walter , for having a choice of tenants , very responsible tenants .
Sir Walter Elliot	"Many a noble fortune has been made during the war . If a rich admiral were to come in our way , Sir Walter-- "" "" He would be a very lucky man , Shepherd , "" replied Sir Walter ; "" that 's all I have to remark ."
Sir Walter Elliot	"Mr Shepherd laughed , as he knew he must , at this wit , and then added-- "" I presume to observe , Sir Walter , that , in the way of business , gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with . I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business ; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions , and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with ."
Sir Walter Elliot	"Therefore , Sir Walter , what I would take leave to suggest is , that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention ; which must be contemplated as a possible thing , because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other ; consequence has its tax ; I , John Shepherd , might conceal any family - matters that I chose , for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me ; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude ; and therefore , thus much I venture upon , that it will not greatly surprise me if , with all our caution , some rumour of the truth should get abroad ; in the supposition of which , as I was going to observe , since applications will unquestionably follow , I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to ; and beg leave to add , that two hours will bring me over at any time , to save you the trouble of replying . """
Sir Walter Elliot	Sir Walter only nodded .
Sir Walter Elliot	"But soon afterwards , rising and pacing the room , he observed sarcastically-- "" There are few among the gentlemen of the navy , I imagine , who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description ."
Sir Walter Elliot	These valuable pictures of yours , Sir Walter , if you chose to leave them , would be perfectly safe .
Sir Walter Elliot	""" "" As to all that , "" rejoined Sir Walter coolly , "" supposing I were induced to let my house , I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it . I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant ."
Sir Walter Elliot	"but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure - grounds , is another thing . I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable ; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden . I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour , I assure you , be he sailor or soldier . "" After a short pause , Mr Shepherd presumed to say-- "" In all these cases , there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant . Your interest , Sir Walter , is in pretty safe hands ."
Sir Walter Elliot	"I venture to hint , that Sir Walter Elliot can not be half so jealous for his own , as John Shepherd will be for him . "" Here Anne spoke-- "" The navy , I think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give ."
Sir Walter Elliot	"; but Sir Walter 's remark was , soon afterwards-- "" The profession has its utility , but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it ."
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Yes ; it is in two points offensive to me ; I have two strong grounds of objection to it ."
Sir Walter Elliot	First , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man 's youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man . I have observed it all my life .
Sir Walter Elliot	A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line . One day last spring , in town , I was in company with two men , striking instances of what I am talking of ; Lord St Ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; I was to give place to Lord St Ives , and a certain Admiral Baldwin , the most deplorable - looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top . ` In the name of heaven , who is that old fellow ? ' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( Sir Basil Morley ) . ` Old fellow ! ' cried Sir Basil , ` it is Admiral Baldwin . What do you take his age to be ? '
Sir Walter Elliot	' ` Forty , ' replied Sir Basil , ` forty , and no more . ' Picture to yourselves my amazement ; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin .
Sir Walter Elliot	I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea - faring life can do ; but to a degree , I know it is the same with them all : they are all knocked about , and exposed to every climate , and every weather , till they are not fit to be seen .
Sir Walter Elliot	"It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once , before they reach Admiral Baldwin 's age . "" "" Nay , Sir Walter , "" cried Mrs Clay , "" this is being severe indeed ."
Sir Walter Elliot	"In fact , as I have long been convinced , though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn , it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any , who can live in a regular way , in the country , choosing their own hours , following their own pursuits , and living on their own property , without the torment of trying for more ; it is only their lot , I say , to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost : I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young . """
Sir Walter Elliot	It seemed as if Mr Shepherd , in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter 's good will towards a naval officer as tenant , had been gifted with foresight ; for the very first application for the house was from an Admiral Croft , with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton ; and indeed , he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent .
Sir Walter Elliot	By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make , Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire , who having acquired a very handsome fortune , was wishing to settle in his own country , and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood , which , however , had not suited him ; that accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold , Mr Shepherd observed , Sir Walter 's concerns could not be kept a secret,)-- accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let , and understanding his ( Mr Shepherd 's ) connection with the owner , he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries , and had , in the course of a pretty long conference , expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel ; and given Mr Shepherd , in his explicit account of himself , every proof of his being a most responsible , eligible tenant .
Sir Walter Elliot	""" And who is Admiral Croft ? "" was Sir Walter 's cold suspicious inquiry ."
Sir Walter Elliot	"He was in the Trafalgar action , and has been in the East Indies since ; he was stationed there , I believe , several years . "" "" Then I take it for granted , "" observed Sir Walter , "" that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery . """
Sir Walter Elliot	Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him , that Admiral Croft was a very hale , hearty , well - looking man , a little weather - beaten , to be sure , but not much , and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour ; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms , only wanted a comfortable home , and to get into it as soon as possible ; knew he must pay for his convenience ; knew what rent a ready - furnished house of that consequence might fetch ; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more ; had inquired about the manor ; would be glad of the deputation , certainly , but made no great point of it ; said he sometimes took out a gun , but never killed ; quite the gentleman .
Sir Walter Elliot	"A house was never taken good care of , Mr Shepherd observed , without a lady : he did not know , whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady , as where there were many children . A lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world . He had seen Mrs Croft , too ; she was at Taunton with the admiral , and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over . "" And a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be , "" continued he ; "" asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the Admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , Sir Walter , I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford . Bless me !"
Sir Walter Elliot	At this moment I can not recollect his name , though I have heard it so lately .
Sir Walter Elliot	Penelope , my dear , can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford : Mrs Croft 's brother ?
Sir Walter Elliot	He had the curacy of Monkford , you know , Sir Walter , some time back , for two or three years .
Sir Walter Elliot	"One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common . "" As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter 's estimate of the dues of a tenant . It succeeded , however ; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house , and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms , he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty , and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft , who still remained at Taunton , and fix a day for the house being seen ."
Sir Walter Elliot	Sir Walter was not very wise ; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel , that a more unobjectionable tenant , in all essentials , than Admiral Croft bid fair to be , could hardly offer .
Sir Walter Elliot	"So far went his understanding ; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing , in the Admiral 's situation in life , which was just high enough , and not too high . """
Sir Walter Elliot	"I have let my house to Admiral Croft , "" would sound extremely well ; very much better than to any mere Mr-- ; a Mr ( save , perhaps , some half dozen in the nation , ) always needs a note of explanation ."
Sir Walter Elliot	In all their dealings and intercourse , Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence .
Sir Walter Elliot	Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place , a lofty dignified situation , such as becomes a man of consequence ; and both he and Elizabeth were settled there , much to their satisfaction .
Sir Walter Elliot	"Anne entered it with a sinking heart , anticipating an imprisonment of many months , and anxiously saying to herself , "" Oh ! when shall I leave you again ? """
Sir Walter Elliot	He had been in Bath about a fortnight ; ( he had passed through Bath in November , in his way to London , when the intelligence of Sir Walter 's being settled there had of course reached him , though only twenty - four hours in the place , but he had not been able to avail himself of it ;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath , and his first object on arriving , had been to leave his card in Camden Place , following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet , and when they did meet , by such great openness of conduct , such readiness to apologize for the past , such solicitude to be received as a relation again , that their former good understanding was completely re - established .
Sir Walter Elliot	He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him ; and certainly , the pains he had been taking on this , the first opportunity of reconciliation , to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir - presumptive , was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject .
Sir Walter Elliot	The circumstances of his marriage , too , were found to admit of much extenuation . This was an article not to be entered on by himself ; but a very intimate friend of his , a Colonel Wallis , a highly respectable man , perfectly the gentleman , ( and not an ill - looking man , Sir Walter added ) , who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings , and had , at his own particular request , been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot , had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage , which made a material difference in the discredit of it . Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long , had been well acquainted also with his wife , had perfectly understood the whole story .
Sir Walter Elliot	Without that attraction , not all her money would have tempted Elliot , and Sir Walter was , moreover , assured of her having been a very fine woman . Here was a great deal to soften the business .
Sir Walter Elliot	A very fine woman with a large fortune , in love with him !
Sir Walter Elliot	Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology ; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light , she allowed it be a great extenuation . Mr Elliot had called repeatedly , had dined with them once , evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked , for they gave no dinners in general ; delighted , in short , by every proof of cousinly notice , and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place .
Sir Walter Elliot	In a worldly view , he had nothing to gain by being on terms with Sir Walter ; nothing to risk by a state of variance .
Sir Walter Elliot	They were describing him themselves ; Sir Walter especially .
Sir Walter Elliot	"He did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance , his air of elegance and fashion , his good shaped face , his sensible eye ; but , at the same time , "" must lament his being very much under - hung , a defect which time seemed to have increased ; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse ."
Sir Walter Elliot	"Mr Elliot appeared to think that he ( Sir Walter ) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted ; "" but Sir Walter had "" not been able to return the compliment entirely , which had embarrassed him ."
Sir Walter Elliot	He did not mean to complain , however .
Sir Walter Elliot	"Sir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis ; she was said to be an excessively pretty woman , beautiful . "" He longed to see her ."
Sir Walter Elliot	He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets .
Sir Walter Elliot	He did not mean to say that there were no pretty women , but the number of the plain was out of all proportion .
Sir Walter Elliot	He had frequently observed , as he walked , that one handsome face would be followed by thirty , or five - and - thirty frights ; and once , as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street , he had counted eighty - seven women go by , one after another , without there being a tolerable face among them . It had been a frosty morning , to be sure , a sharp frost , which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of .
Sir Walter Elliot	"It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable , by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced . He had never walked anywhere arm - in - arm with Colonel Wallis ( who was a fine military figure , though sandy - haired ) without observing that every woman 's eye was upon him ; every woman 's eye was sure to be upon Colonel Wallis . "" Modest Sir Walter !"
Sir Walter Elliot	He was not allowed to escape , however .
Sir Walter Elliot	His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis 's companion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis , and certainly was not sandy - haired .
Sir Walter Elliot	""" How is Mary looking ? "" said Sir Walter , in the height of his good humour ."
Sir Walter Elliot	""" The last time I saw her she had a red nose , but I hope that may not happen every day ."
Sir Walter Elliot	""" If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , I would send her a new hat and pelisse . "" Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown , or a cap , would not be liable to any such misuse , when a knock at the door suspended everything ."
Sir Walter Elliot	"Anne drew a little back , while the others received his compliments , and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour , but "" he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before , "" & c. & c ; which was all as politely done , and as politely taken , as possible , but her part must follow then . Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter ; "" Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter "" ( there was no occasion for remembering Mary ) ; and Anne , smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was ."
Sir Walter Elliot	When he questioned , Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also , but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt .
Sir Walter Elliot	Sir Walter made no objection , and Elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned .
Sir Walter Elliot	Sir Walter , indeed , though he had no affection for Anne , and no vanity flattered , to make him really happy on the occasion , was very far from thinking it a bad match for her . On the contrary , when he saw more of Captain Wentworth , saw him repeatedly by daylight , and eyed him well , he was very much struck by his personal claims , and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank ; and all this , assisted by his well - sounding name , enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen , with a very good grace , for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour .
Sir Walter Elliot	It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness , his best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness which a son - in - law 's rights would have given .
Sir Walter Elliot	Mrs Clay 's affections had overpowered her interest , and she had sacrificed , for the young man 's sake , the possibility of scheming longer for Sir Walter .
Sir Walter Elliot	She has abilities , however , as well as affections ; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning , or hers , may finally carry the day ; whether , after preventing her from being the wife of Sir Walter , he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William . It can not be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion , and the discovery of their deception in her . They had their great cousins , to be sure , to resort to for comfort ; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others , without being flattered and followed in turn , is but a state of half enjoyment .
Sir Walter Elliot	4 He was not Mr Wentworth , the former curate of Monkford , however suspicious appearances may be , but a Captain Frederick Wentworth , his brother , who being made commander in consequence of the action off St Domingo , and not immediately employed , had come into Somersetshire , in the summer of 1806 ; and having no parent living , found a home for half a year at Monkford . He was , at that time , a remarkably fine young man , with a great deal of intelligence , spirit , and brilliancy ; and Anne an extremely pretty girl , with gentleness , modesty , taste , and feeling .
Sir Walter Elliot	Half the sum of attraction , on either side , might have been enough , for he had nothing to do , and she had hardly anybody to love ; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail .
Sir Walter Elliot	It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other , or which had been the happiest : she , in receiving his declarations and proposals , or he in having them accepted .
Sir Walter Elliot	Sir Walter , on being applied to , without actually withholding his consent , or saying it should never be , gave it all the negative of great astonishment , great coldness , great silence , and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter .
Sir Walter Elliot	He thought it a very degrading alliance ; and Lady Russell , though with more tempered and pardonable pride , received it as a most unfortunate one . Anne Elliot , with all her claims of birth , beauty , and mind , to throw herself away at nineteen ; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man , who had nothing but himself to recommend him , and no hopes of attaining affluence , but in the chances of a most uncertain profession , and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession , would be , indeed , a throwing away , which she grieved to think of !
Sir Walter Elliot	Captain Wentworth had no fortune .
Sir Walter Elliot	He had been lucky in his profession ; but spending freely , what had come freely , had realized nothing . But he was confident that he should soon be rich : full of life and ardour , he knew that he should soon have a ship , and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted .
Sir Walter Elliot	He had always been lucky ; he knew he should be so still .
Sir Walter Elliot	His sanguine temper , and fearlessness of mind , operated very differently on her .
Sir Walter Elliot	It only added a dangerous character to himself . He was brilliant , he was headstrong .
Sir Walter Elliot	More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close ; and time had softened down much , perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him , but she had been too dependent on time alone ; no aid had been given in change of place ( except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture ) , or in any novelty or enlargement of society .
Sir Walter Elliot	No one had ever come within the Kellynch circle , who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth , as he stood in her memory .
Sir Walter Elliot	No second attachment , the only thoroughly natural , happy , and sufficient cure , at her time of life , had been possible to the nice tone of her mind , the fastidiousness of her taste , in the small limits of the society around them . She had been solicited , when about two - and - twenty , to change her name , by the young man , who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister ; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal ; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man , whose landed property and general importance were second in that country , only to Sir Walter 's , and of good character and appearance ; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more , while Anne was nineteen , she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty - two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father 's house , and settled so permanently near herself .
Sir Walter Elliot	With all these circumstances , recollections and feelings , she could not hear that Captain Wentworth 's sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain ; and many a stroll , and many a sigh , were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea .
Sir Walter Elliot	Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement , and saw nothing , therefore , but good manners in the other ; and with regard to the gentlemen , there was such an hearty good humour , such an open , trusting liberality on the Admiral 's side , as could not but influence Sir Walter , who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd 's assurances of his being known , by report , to the Admiral , as a model of good breeding .
Sir Walter Elliot	"Sir Walter , without hesitation , declared the Admiral to be the best - looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and the Admiral , with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park , "" I thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at Taunton . The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him . """
Sir Walter Elliot	The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas ; and as Sir Walter proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month , there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement .
Sir Walter Elliot	So far all was perfectly right ; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan , when it burst on her , which was , Mrs Clay 's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth , as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her .
Sir Walter Elliot	The last office of the four carriage - horses was to draw Sir Walter , Miss Elliot , and Mrs Clay to Bath .
Sir Walter Elliot	The party drove off in very good spirits ; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves ,
Sir Walter Elliot	"Sir Walter , without hesitation , declared the Admiral to be the best - looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and the Admiral , with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park , "" I thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at Taunton . The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him . """
Elizabeth Elliot	Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne ; she knew nothing of their looks , and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done . While they were speaking , a whispering between her father and Elizabeth caught her ear . She could not distinguish , but she must guess the subject ; and on Captain Wentworth 's making a distant bow , she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance , and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself .
Elizabeth Elliot	Upon Lady Russell 's appearance soon afterwards , the whole party was collected , and all that remained was to marshal themselves , and proceed into the Concert Room ; and be of all the consequence in their power , draw as many eyes , excite as many whispers , and disturb as many people as they could . Very , very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in . Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret , and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her , had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach ; and Anne -- but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne 's felicity , to draw any comparison between it and her sister 's ; the origin of one all selfish vanity , of the other all generous attachment . Anne saw nothing , thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room .
Elizabeth Elliot	Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again , and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret , in a manner not to be refused , to sit between them ; and by some other removals , and a little scheming of her own , Anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before , much more within reach of a passer - by .
Elizabeth Elliot	"Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in Cheshire ; how mentioned in Dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of Charles II , with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto:--""Principal seat , Kellynch Hall , in the county of Somerset , "" and Sir Walter 's handwriting again in this finale:-- "" Heir presumptive , William Walter Elliot , Esq . , great grandson of the second Sir Walter . """
Elizabeth Elliot	His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment ; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own .
Elizabeth Elliot	had passed away since Lady Elliot 's death , and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends , and one remained a widower , the other a widow .
Elizabeth Elliot	It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty - nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost . It was so with Elizabeth , still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and Sir Walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing .
Elizabeth Elliot	She had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should . He had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after Lady Elliot 's death , Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing - back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to London , when Elizabeth was in her first bloom , Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction .
Elizabeth Elliot	He was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed .
Elizabeth Elliot	He was invited to Kellynch Hall ; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year ; but he never came .
Elizabeth Elliot	The following spring he was seen again in town , found equally agreeable , again encouraged , invited , and expected , and again he did not come ; and the next tidings were that he was married . Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot , he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth .
Elizabeth Elliot	"As the head of the house , he felt that he ought to have been consulted , especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand ; "" For they must have been seen together , "" he observed , "" once at Tattersall 's , and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons . """
Elizabeth Elliot	Mr Elliot had attempted no apology , and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family , as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it : all acquaintance between them had ceased .
Elizabeth Elliot	Elizabeth 's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest .
Elizabeth Elliot	If Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves , had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance , and proclaim the value of the connection , as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect .
Elizabeth Elliot	""" I had not the smallest intention of asking him , "" said Elizabeth , with affected carelessness , "" but he gave so many hints ; so Mrs Clay says , at least . "" "" Indeed , I do say it ."
Elizabeth Elliot	I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation .
Elizabeth Elliot	"I was really in pain for him ; for your hard - hearted sister , Miss Anne , seems bent on cruelty . "" "" Oh ! "" cried Elizabeth , "" I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman 's hints ."
Elizabeth Elliot	However , when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning , I gave way immediately , for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together .
Elizabeth Elliot	I lay no embargo on any body 's words .
Elizabeth Elliot	But , upon my word , I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men .
Elizabeth Elliot	""" "" My dear Miss Elliot ! "" exclaimed Mrs Clay , lifting her hands and eyes , and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence ."
Elizabeth Elliot	I did invite him , you know .
Elizabeth Elliot	I sent him away with smiles .
Elizabeth Elliot	When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to - morrow , I had compassion on him .
Elizabeth Elliot	It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her ; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party , seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort . It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and Elizabeth ; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them ! Mrs Clay 's selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his ; and Anne would have compounded for the marriage at once , with all its evils , to be clear of Mr Elliot 's subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it .
Elizabeth Elliot	""" Very well , "" said Elizabeth , "" I have nothing to send but my love ."
Elizabeth Elliot	you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me , and pretend I have read it through .
Elizabeth Elliot	I really can not be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out .
Elizabeth Elliot	You need not tell her so , but I thought her dress hideous the other night .
Elizabeth Elliot	I used to think she had some taste in dress , but I was ashamed of her at the concert .
Elizabeth Elliot	"and she sits so upright ! My best love , of course . "" "" And mine , "" added Sir Walter ."
Elizabeth Elliot	"After the usual period of suspense , the usual sounds of approach were heard , and "" Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove "" were ushered into the room . Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance ; but Anne was really glad to see them ; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome ; and as soon as it became clear that these , their nearest relations , were not arrived with an views of accommodation in that house , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality , and do the honours of it very well ."
Elizabeth Elliot	They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove , and were at the White Hart . So much was pretty soon understood ; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing - room , and regaling themselves with her admiration , Anne could not draw upon Charles 's brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary , as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of .
Elizabeth Elliot	Elizabeth was , for a short time , suffering a good deal .
Elizabeth Elliot	She felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them ; but she could not bear to have the difference of style , the reduction of servants , which a dinner must betray , witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch .
Elizabeth Elliot	It was a struggle between propriety and vanity ; but vanity got the better , and then Elizabeth was happy again .
Elizabeth Elliot	"These were her internal persuasions : "" Old fashioned notions ; country hospitality ; we do not profess to give dinners ; few people in Bath do ; Lady Alicia never does ; did not even ask her own sister 's family , though they were here a month : and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove ; put her quite out of her way ."
Elizabeth Elliot	And this satisfied Elizabeth :
Elizabeth Elliot	Captain Wentworth was acknowledged again by each , by Elizabeth more graciously than before .
Elizabeth Elliot	She even addressed him once , and looked at him more than once .
Elizabeth Elliot	Elizabeth was , in fact , revolving a great measure .
Elizabeth Elliot	After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings , she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves .
Elizabeth Elliot	"It was all said very gracefully , and the cards with which she had provided herself , the "" Miss Elliot at home , "" were laid on the table , with a courteous , comprehensive smile to all , and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth ."
Elizabeth Elliot	The truth was , that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his .
Elizabeth Elliot	The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about well in her drawing - room . The card was pointedly given , and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared .
Elizabeth Elliot	""" Only think of Elizabeth 's including everybody ! "" whispered Mary very audibly ."
Elizabeth Elliot	Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning , therefore , she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place , there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow 's party , the frequent enumeration of the persons invited , and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath , while harassing herself with the never - ending question , of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not ?
Elizabeth Elliot	But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth .
Elizabeth Elliot	If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth , that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which can not be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle .
Elizabeth Elliot	Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both , and so on , through the whole list of Lady Russell 's too gentle reductions .
Elizabeth Elliot	Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from Kellynch , only fifty miles , and Lady Russell 's spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell , whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there .
Elizabeth Elliot	Elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy , which she wished to see interrupted .
Elizabeth Elliot	It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd , who had returned , after an unprosperous marriage , to her father 's house , with the additional burden of two children . She was a clever young woman , who understood the art of pleasing -- the art of pleasing , at least , at Kellynch Hall ; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot , as to have been already staying there more than once , in spite of all that Lady Russell , who thought it a friendship quite out of place , could hint of caution and reserve .
Elizabeth Elliot	Lady Russell , indeed , had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth , and seemed to love her , rather because she would love her , than because Elizabeth deserved it .
Elizabeth Elliot	She had never received from her more than outward attention , nothing beyond the observances of complaisance ; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry , against previous inclination . She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : Elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility .
Elizabeth Elliot	"Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond . "" How is Mary ? "" said Elizabeth ; and without waiting for an answer ,"
Elizabeth Elliot	"said Sir Walter . "" Poor old gentleman . "" "" Have they any acquaintance here ? "" asked Elizabeth ."
Elizabeth Elliot	I do not know ; but I can hardly suppose that , at Admiral Croft 's time of life , and in his profession , he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this .
Elizabeth Elliot	Elizabeth , may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place ?
Elizabeth Elliot	I think not .
Elizabeth Elliot	This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth 's share of interest in the letter ; when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove , and her fine little boys , Anne was at liberty . In her own room , she tried to comprehend it .
Elizabeth Elliot	"Can I be of any use ? "" "" None , I thank you , unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together ."
Elizabeth Elliot	How do you like Bath , Miss Elliot ? It suits us very well .
Elizabeth Elliot	He looked very well , not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits , and he talked of Uppercross , of the Musgroves , nay , even of Louisa , and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her ; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable , not easy , not able to feign that he was . It did not surprise , but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him .
Elizabeth Elliot	She saw that he saw Elizabeth , that Elizabeth saw him , that there was complete internal recognition on each side ; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance , expecting it , and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness .
Elizabeth Elliot	Elizabeth had turned from him , Lady Russell overlooked him ; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances ; she felt that she owed him attention .
Elizabeth Elliot	Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth : but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal , that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand ; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her .
Elizabeth Elliot	Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place , a lofty dignified situation , such as becomes a man of consequence ; and both he and Elizabeth were settled there , much to their satisfaction .
Elizabeth Elliot	She might not wonder , but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change , should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder , should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town ; and she must sigh , and smile , and wonder too , as Elizabeth threw open the folding - doors and walked with exultation from one drawing - room to the other , boasting of their space ; at the possibility of that woman , who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall , finding extent to be proud of between two walls , perhaps thirty feet asunder .
Elizabeth Elliot	Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology ; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light , she allowed it be a great extenuation . Mr Elliot had called repeatedly , had dined with them once , evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked , for they gave no dinners in general ; delighted , in short , by every proof of cousinly notice , and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place .
Elizabeth Elliot	A sensible man , and he had looked like a very sensible man , why should it be an object to him ? She could only offer one solution ; it was , perhaps , for Elizabeth 's sake .
Elizabeth Elliot	There might really have been a liking formerly , though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way ; and now that he could afford to please himself , he might mean to pay his addresses to her . Elizabeth was certainly very handsome , with well - bred , elegant manners , and her character might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot , knowing her but in public , and when very young himself .
Elizabeth Elliot	How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one . Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if Elizabeth were his object ; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while Mr Elliot 's frequent visits were talked of . Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme , but without being much attended to .
Elizabeth Elliot	When he questioned , Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also , but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt .
Elizabeth Elliot	Sir Walter made no objection , and Elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned .
Elizabeth Elliot	She has abilities , however , as well as affections ; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning , or hers , may finally carry the day ; whether , after preventing her from being the wife of Sir Walter , he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William . It can not be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion , and the discovery of their deception in her . They had their great cousins , to be sure , to resort to for comfort ; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others , without being flattered and followed in turn , is but a state of half enjoyment .
Mrs. Smith	Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith , meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call ; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object .
Mrs. Smith	Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well know by name to Mrs Smith .
Mrs. Smith	""" The little Durands were there , I conclude , "" said she , "" with their mouths open to catch the music , like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed ."
Mrs. Smith	I need not ask after her . She never misses , I know ; and you must have seen her . She must have been in your own circle ; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple , you were in the seats of grandeur , round the orchestra , of course .
Mrs. Smith	I can understand .
Mrs. Smith	""" No , no ; you were better employed . You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening ."
Mrs. Smith	I see it in your eye .
Mrs. Smith	"I perfectly see how the hours passed : that you had always something agreeable to listen to . In the intervals of the concert it was conversation . "" Anne half smiled and said , "" Do you see that in my eye ?"
Mrs. Smith	""" Yes , I do ."
Mrs. Smith	Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world , the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together .
Mrs. Smith	""" And such being the case , "" continued Mrs Smith , after a short pause , "" I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning ."
Mrs. Smith	"It is really very good of you to come and sit with me , when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time . "" Anne heard nothing of this ."
Mrs. Smith	"She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend 's penetration , unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her . After another short silence-- "" Pray , "" said Mrs Smith , "" is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ? Does he know that I am in Bath ?"
Mrs. Smith	"She caught it instantaneously ; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety , soon added , more composedly , "" Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot ? """
Mrs. Smith	""" I have been a good deal acquainted with him , "" replied Mrs Smith , gravely , "" but it seems worn out now ."
Mrs. Smith	""" "" I was not at all aware of this ."
Mrs. Smith	You never mentioned it before .
Mrs. Smith	"Had I known it , I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you . "" "" To confess the truth , "" said Mrs Smith , assuming her usual air of cheerfulness , "" that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have ."
Mrs. Smith	I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot . I want your interest with him .
Mrs. Smith	"He can be of essential service to me ; and if you would have the goodness , my dear Miss Elliot , to make it an object to yourself , of course it is done . """
Mrs. Smith	""" I should be extremely happy ; I hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you , "" replied Anne ; "" but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case ."
Mrs. Smith	I am sure you have , somehow or other , imbibed such a notion .
Mrs. Smith	You must consider me only as Mr Elliot 's relation .
Mrs. Smith	"If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me . "" Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance , and then , smiling , said-- "" I have been a little premature , I perceive ; I beg your pardon ."
Mrs. Smith	I ought to have waited for official information ,
Mrs. Smith	I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week .
Mrs. Smith	"I should like to know why you imagine I am ? "" Mrs Smith looked at her again , looked earnestly , smiled , shook her head , and exclaimed-- "" Now , how I do wish I understood you !"
Mrs. Smith	How I do wish I knew what you were at !
Mrs. Smith	I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel , when the right moment occurs .
Mrs. Smith	Let me plead for my -- present friend I can not call him , but for my former friend .
Mrs. Smith	Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike , agreeable man ? Let me recommend Mr Elliot .
Mrs. Smith	I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis ; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis ?
Mrs. Smith	""" "" My dear Mrs Smith , Mr Elliot 's wife has not been dead much above half a year . He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one . "" "" Oh !"
Mrs. Smith	"if these are your only objections , "" cried Mrs Smith , archly , "" Mr Elliot is safe , and I shall give myself no more trouble about him ."
Mrs. Smith	Well , my dear Miss Elliot , I hope and trust you will be very happy .
Mrs. Smith	Will not this manner of speaking of him , Mrs Smith , convince you that he is nothing to me ?
Mrs. Smith	I assure you I shall not .
Mrs. Smith	"I assure you , Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing , in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford : not Mr Elliot ; it is not Mr Elliot that-- "" She stopped , regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much ; but less would hardly have been sufficient ."
Mrs. Smith	Mrs Smith would hardly have believed so soon in Mr Elliot 's failure , but from the perception of there being a somebody else . As it was , she instantly submitted , and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond ; and Anne , eager to escape farther notice , was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot ; where she could have received the idea , or from whom she could have heard it .
Mrs. Smith	""" Do tell me how it first came into your head ."
Mrs. Smith	""" "" It first came into my head , "" replied Mrs Smith , "" upon finding how much you were together , and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you ; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way ."
Mrs. Smith	But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago .
Mrs. Smith	"I observed no one in particular . "" "" It was my friend Mrs Rooke ; Nurse Rooke ; who , by - the - bye , had a great curiosity to see you , and was delighted to be in the way to let you in . She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday ; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot . She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself , which did not seem bad authority ."
Mrs. Smith	Mrs Smith said nothing .
Mrs. Smith	""" But , "" continued Anne , presently , "" though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot , I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could ."
Mrs. Smith	Shall I mention to him your being in Bath ?
Mrs. Smith	In the warmth of the moment , and under a mistaken impression , I might , perhaps , have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances ; but not now .
Mrs. Smith	No , I thank you , I have nothing to trouble you with .
Mrs. Smith	""" I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years ?"
Mrs. Smith	""" Not before he was married , I suppose ? """
Mrs. Smith	""" "" I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years , "" was Mrs Smith 's answer , given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther ; and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity ."
Mrs. Smith	They were both silent : Mrs Smith very thoughtful .
Mrs. Smith	But I will try to command myself . I will not abuse him .
Mrs. Smith	I will only tell you what I have found him .
Mrs. Smith	I found them most intimate friends ; and I , too , became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot , and entertained
Mrs. Smith	At nineteen , you know , one does not think very seriously ; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others , and much more agreeable than most others , and we were almost always together .
Mrs. Smith	""" "" I know it all , I know it all , "" cried Mrs Smith ."
Mrs. Smith	""" He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him , but I heard him speak of them for ever ."
Mrs. Smith	I know he was invited and encouraged , and I know he did not choose to go .
Mrs. Smith	I can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , I knew all about it at the time .
Mrs. Smith	I was privy to all the fors and againsts ; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans ; and
Mrs. Smith	"though I did not know his wife previously , her inferior situation in society , indeed , rendered that impossible , yet I knew her all her life afterwards , or at least till within the last two years of her life , and can answer any question you may wish to put . "" "" Nay , "" said Anne , "" I have no particular enquiry to make about her . I have always understood they were not a happy couple . But I should like to know why , at that time of his life , he should slight my father 's acquaintance as he did . My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him . Why did Mr Elliot draw back ?"
Mrs. Smith	""" "" Mr Elliot , "" replied Mrs Smith , "" at that period of his life , had one object in view : to make his fortune , and by a rather quicker process than the law . He was determined to make it by marriage ."
Mrs. Smith	He was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and I know it was his belief ( whether justly or not , of course I can not decide ) , that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence .
Mrs. Smith	That was his motive for drawing back , I can assure you .
Mrs. Smith	He told me the whole story .
Mrs. Smith	""" Perhaps , "" cried Anne , struck by a sudden idea , "" you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot ?"
Mrs. Smith	""" To be sure I did ; very often ."
Mrs. Smith	"I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot , and vouch for your being a very different creature from-- "" She checked herself just in time ."
Mrs. Smith	But I beg your pardon ; I have interrupted you .
Mrs. Smith	"The circumstances , probably , which first opened your eyes to his character . "" Mrs Smith hesitated a little here ."
Mrs. Smith	When one lives in the world , a man or woman 's marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought . I was very young , and associated only with the young , and we were a thoughtless , gay set , without any strict rules of conduct .
Mrs. Smith	I think differently now ; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions ; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing .
Mrs. Smith	""" But was not she a very low woman ? "" "" Yes ; which I objected to , but he would not regard ."
Mrs. Smith	I have often heard him declare , that if baronetcies were saleable , anybody should have his for fifty pounds , arms and motto , name and livery included ; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject .
Mrs. Smith	""" Indeed , my dear Mrs Smith , I want none , "" cried Anne ."
Mrs. Smith	"I am more curious to know why he should be so different now . "" "" But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary ; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . """
Mrs. Smith	Anne , seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it , did as she was desired .
Mrs. Smith	"The box was brought and placed before her , and Mrs Smith , sighing over it as she unlocked it , said-- "" This is full of papers belonging to him , to my husband ; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him ."
Mrs. Smith	The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine .
Mrs. Smith	But he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when I came to examine his papers , I found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed .
Mrs. Smith	Here it is ; I would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot , I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy .
Mrs. Smith	"I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it . "" This was the letter , directed to "" Charles Smith , Esq . Tunbridge Wells , "" and dated from London , as far back as July , 1803 : -- "" Dear Smith,--I have received yours ."
Mrs. Smith	Your kindness almost overpowers me .
Mrs. Smith	I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common , but I have lived three - and - twenty years in the world , and have seen none like it .
Mrs. Smith	At present , believe me , I have no need of your services , being in cash again .
Mrs. Smith	Give me joy : I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss. They are gone back to Kellynch , and almost made me swear to visit them this summer ; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor , to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer .
Mrs. Smith	If he does , however , they will leave me in peace , which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion .
Mrs. Smith	"and I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again , meaning , for the rest of my life , to be only yours truly,--Wm . Elliot . "" Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow ; and Mrs Smith , observing the high colour in her face , said-- "" The language , I know , is highly disrespectful . Though I have forgot the exact terms , I have a perfect impression of the general meaning ."
Mrs. Smith	Mark his professions to my poor husband .
Mrs. Smith	"She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour , that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies , that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others , before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over , and say-- "" Thank you ."
Mrs. Smith	This is full proof undoubtedly ; proof of every thing you were saying . But why be acquainted with us now ?
Mrs. Smith	""" I can explain this too , "" cried Mrs Smith , smiling ."
Mrs. Smith	""" Can you really ?"
Mrs. Smith	I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago , and I will shew him as he is now .
Mrs. Smith	I can not produce written proof again , but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire , of what he is now wanting , and what he is now doing . He is no hypocrite now .
Mrs. Smith	He truly wants to marry you .
Mrs. Smith	His present attentions to your family are very sincere : quite from the heart .
Mrs. Smith	"I will give you my authority : his friend Colonel Wallis . "" "" Colonel Wallis !"
Mrs. Smith	"you are acquainted with him ? "" "" No ."
Mrs. Smith	It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that ; it takes a bend or two , but nothing of consequence .
Mrs. Smith	The stream is as good as at first ; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away . Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his views on you , which said Colonel Wallis , I imagine to be , in himself , a sensible , careful , discerning sort of character ; but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife , to whom he tells things which he had better not , and he repeats it all to her .
Mrs. Smith	She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery , repeats it all to her nurse ; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you , very naturally brings it all to me .
Mrs. Smith	On Monday evening , my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings .
Mrs. Smith	"When I talked of a whole history , therefore , you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed . "" "" My dear Mrs Smith , your authority is deficient ."
Mrs. Smith	""" "" I know you did ; I know it all perfectly , but-- "" "" Indeed , Mrs Smith , we must not expect to get real information in such a line ."
Mrs. Smith	"Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many , to be misconceived by folly in one , and ignorance in another , can hardly have much truth left . "" "" Only give me a hearing ."
Mrs. Smith	So says my historian , at least .
Mrs. Smith	""" "" Well , "" continued Mrs Smith , triumphantly , "" grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted ."
Mrs. Smith	He saw you then at Lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place , as Miss Anne Elliot , and from that moment , I have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there .
Mrs. Smith	But there was another , and an earlier , which I will now explain . If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable , stop me .
Mrs. Smith	"My account states , that your sister 's friend , the lady now staying with you , whom I have heard you mention , came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September ( in short when they first came themselves ) , and has been staying there ever since ; that she is a clever , insinuating , handsome woman , poor and plausible , and altogether such in situation and manner , as to give a general idea , among Sir Walter 's acquaintance , of her meaning to be Lady Elliot , and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently , blind to the danger . """
Mrs. Smith	"Here Mrs Smith paused a moment ; but Anne had not a word to say , and she continued-- "" This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family , long before you returned to it ; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it , though he did not then visit in Camden Place ; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there , and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two , as he happened to do a little before Christmas , Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things , and the reports beginning to prevail ."
Mrs. Smith	I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased , but it is now a confirmed feeling .
Mrs. Smith	Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re - admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ) , to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject .
Mrs. Smith	You can imagine what an artful man would do ; and with this guide , perhaps , may recollect what you have seen him do .
Mrs. Smith	I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot , who would have difficulty in believing it ; but I have never been satisfied .
Mrs. Smith	"I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared . I should like to know his present opinion , as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of ; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not . "" "" Lessening , I understand , "" replied Mrs Smith ."
Mrs. Smith	""" He thinks Mrs Clay afraid of him , aware that he sees through her , and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence . But since he must be absent some time or other , I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence ."
Mrs. Smith	And , indeed , to own the truth , I do not think nurse , in her heart , is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter 's making a second match . She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony , you know ; and ( since self will intrude ) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot , through Mrs Wallis 's recommendation ?
Mrs. Smith	Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion . She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot 's marriage ) they had been as before always together , and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune .
Mrs. Smith	Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself , and was most tender of throwing any on her husband ; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living , and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance . From his wife 's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings , easy temper , careless habits , and not strong understanding , much more amiable than his friend , and very unlike him , led by him , and probably despised by him .
Mrs. Smith	Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion , answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith , which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble , and , under a cold civility , the same hard - hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her .
Mrs. Smith	She had previously , in the anticipation of their marriage , been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it ; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature , since he did not even know her to be in Bath , it immediately occurred , that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved , and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne 's feelings , as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot 's character would allow , when Anne 's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything ; and while it took from her the new - formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety , left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way . After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot , Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith 's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation .
Mrs. Smith	""" My dear , "" was Mrs Smith 's reply , "" there was nothing else to be done ."
Mrs. Smith	I considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and I could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband .
Mrs. Smith	My heart bled for you , as I talked of happiness ; and yet he is sensible , he is agreeable , and with such a woman as you , it was not absolutely hopeless .
Mrs. Smith	I was willing to hope that you must fare better .
Mrs. Smith	""" Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed . It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell !"
Mrs. Smith	It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived ; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference , which carried them through the greater part of the morning , was , that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Smith , in which his conduct was involved .
Mrs. Smith	Miss Hamilton , now Mrs Smith , had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable .
Mrs. Smith	Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith , and Anne therefore lost no time in going .
Mrs. Smith	She only consulted Lady Russell , who entered thoroughly into her sentiments , and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith 's lodgings in Westgate Buildings , as Anne chose to be taken . The visit was paid , their acquaintance re - established , their interest in each other more than re - kindled .
Mrs. Smith	Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming , silent , unformed girl of fifteen , to the elegant little woman of seven - and - twenty , with every beauty except bloom , and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle ; and twelve years had transformed the fine - looking , well - grown Miss Hamilton , in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority , into a poor , infirm , helpless widow , receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour ; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away , and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times .
Mrs. Smith	Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on , and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation .
Mrs. Smith	Neither the dissipations of the past -- and she had lived very much in the world -- nor the restrictions of the present , neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits . In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness , and Anne 's astonishment increased .
Mrs. Smith	She could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith 's .
Mrs. Smith	There had been a time , Mrs Smith told her , when her spirits had nearly failed . She could not call herself an invalid now , compared with her state on first reaching Bath .
Mrs. Smith	""" And she , "" said Mrs Smith , "" besides nursing me most admirably , has really proved an invaluable acquaintance ."
Mrs. Smith	As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit , which has been a great amusement ; and she put me in the way of making these little thread - cases , pin - cushions and card - racks , which you always find me so busy about , and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood .
Mrs. Smith	She had a large acquaintance , of course professionally , among those who can afford to buy , and she disposes of my merchandise .
Mrs. Smith	""" "" Yes , "" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly , "" sometimes it may , though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe ."
Mrs. Smith	"It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith ; she shook it off , and soon added in a different tone-- "" I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me . She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings ; a mere pretty , silly , expensive , fashionable woman , I believe ; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery ."
Mrs. Smith	""" She sees nothing to blame in it , "" replied Anne ; "" on the contrary , she approves it , and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs Smith ."
Mrs. Smith	""" Sir Henry Russell 's widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot . A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings ! A poor widow barely able to live , between thirty and forty ; a mere Mrs Smith , an every - day Mrs Smith , of all people and all names in the world , to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot , and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland ! Mrs Smith !"
Mrs. Smith	She left it to himself to recollect , that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty , with little to live on , and no surname of dignity .
Mrs. Smith	A Mrs Smith .
Mrs. Smith	A widow Mrs Smith ; and who was her husband ?
Mrs. Smith	One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere . And what is her attraction ?
Mrs. Smith	That she is old and sickly .
Mrs. Smith	But surely you may put off this old lady till to - morrow : she is not so near her end , I presume , but that she may hope to see another day .
Mrs. Smith	What is her age ?
Mrs. Smith	""" "" No , sir , she is not one - and - thirty ; but I do not think I can put off my engagement , because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself ."
Mrs. Smith	She goes into the warm bath to - morrow , and for the rest of the week , you know , we are engaged .
Mrs. Smith	""" Sir Henry Russell 's widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot . A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings ! A poor widow barely able to live , between thirty and forty ; a mere Mrs Smith , an every - day Mrs Smith , of all people and all names in the world , to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot , and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland ! Mrs Smith !"
Mrs. Smith	She had been the only one of the set absent , for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship 's service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot ; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early , and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her . Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell .
Mrs. Smith	"Lady Russell let this pass , and only said in rejoinder , "" I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother 's place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me . You are your mother 's self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued ! My dearest Anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! """
Mrs. Smith	"The idea of becoming what her mother had been ; of having the precious name of "" Lady Elliot "" first revived in herself ; of being restored to Kellynch , calling it her home again , her home for ever , was a charm which she could not immediately resist . Lady Russell said not another word , willing to leave the matter to its own operation ; and believing that , could Mr Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed , in short , what Anne did not believe ."
Mrs. Smith	She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her ; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off , with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow .
Mrs. Smith	Mrs Smith gave a most good - humoured acquiescence .
Mrs. Smith	""" By all means , "" said she ; "" only tell me all about it , when you do come ."
Mrs. Smith	"Anne named them all . Mrs Smith made no reply ; but when she was leaving her said , and with an expression half serious , half arch , "" Well , I heartily wish your concert may answer ; and do not fail me to - morrow if you can come ; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you . "" Anne was startled and confused ; but after standing in a moment 's suspense , was obliged , and not sorry to be obliged , to hurry away ."
Mrs. Smith	She had but two friends in the world to add to his list , Lady Russell and Mrs Smith .
Mrs. Smith	Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for Mrs Smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently .
Mrs. Smith	Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves , and their marriage , instead of depriving her of one friend , secured her two .
Mrs. Smith	She was their earliest visitor in their settled life ; and Captain Wentworth , by putting her in the way of recovering her husband 's property in the West Indies , by writing for her , acting for her , and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend , fully requited the services which she had rendered , or ever meant to render , to his wife .
Mrs. Smith	Mrs Smith 's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income , with some improvement of health , and the acquisition of such friends to be often with , for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her ; and while these prime supplies of good remained , she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity .
Mrs. Smith	She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy , and yet be happy . Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits , as her friend Anne 's was in the warmth of her heart . Anne was tenderness itself , and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth 's affection .
Mr. Shepherd	1 Sir Walter Elliot , of Kellynch Hall , in Somersetshire , was a man who , for his own amusement , never took up any book but the Baronetage ; there he found occupation for an idle hour , and consolation in a distressed one ; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect , by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents ; there any unwelcome sensations , arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century ; and there , if every other leaf were powerless , he could read his own history with an interest which never failed .
Mr. Shepherd	For one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do . Elizabeth had succeeded , at sixteen , to all that was possible , of her mother 's rights and consequence ; and being very handsome , and very like himself , her influence had always been great , and they had gone on together most happily .
Mr. Shepherd	Mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove ; but Anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister
Mr. Shepherd	Mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove ; but Anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister
Mr. Shepherd	All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably .
Mr. Shepherd	It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty - nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost . It was so with Elizabeth , still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and Sir Walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing .
Mr. Shepherd	Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister , made the book an evil ; and more than once , when her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away . She had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of .
Mr. Shepherd	She had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should . He had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after Lady Elliot 's death , Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing - back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to London , when Elizabeth was in her first bloom , Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction .
Mr. Shepherd	He was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed .
Mr. Shepherd	This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still , after an interval of several years , felt with anger by Elizabeth , who had liked the man for himself , and still more for being her father 's heir , and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot 's eldest daughter . There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal .
Mr. Shepherd	The disgrace of his first marriage might , perhaps , as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring , have been got over , had he not done worse ; but he had , as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends , they had been informed , spoken most disrespectfully of them all , most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to , and the honours which were hereafter to be his own . This could not be pardoned .
Mr. Shepherd	Such were Elizabeth Elliot 's sentiments and sensations ; such the cares to alloy , the agitations to vary , the sameness and the elegance , the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life ; such the feelings to give interest to a long , uneventful residence in one country circle , to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad , no talents or accomplishments for home , to occupy . But now , another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these .
Mr. Shepherd	The Kellynch property was good , but not equal to Sir Walter 's apprehension of the state required in its possessor . While Lady Elliot lived , there had been method , moderation , and economy , which had just kept him within his income ; but with her had died all such right - mindedness , and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it .
Mr. Shepherd	It had not been possible for him to spend less ; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do ; but blameless as he was , he was not only growing dreadfully in debt , but was hearing of it so often , that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer , even partially , from his daughter .
Mr. Shepherd	"He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town ; he had gone so far even as to say , "" Can we retrench ?"
Mr. Shepherd	Mr Shepherd , a civil , cautious lawyer , who , whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter , would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else , excused himself from offering the slightest hint , and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell , from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted .
Mr. Shepherd	"The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd , whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter 's retrenching , and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode . "" Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate , he had no scruple , "" he said , "" in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side ."
Mr. Shepherd	"The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd , whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter 's retrenching , and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode . "" Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate , he had no scruple , "" he said , "" in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side ."
Mr. Shepherd	It did not appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support .
Mr. Shepherd	Sir Walter had at first thought more of London ; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred .
Mr. Shepherd	"Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house . Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word "" advertise , "" but never dared approach it again ."
Mr. Shepherd	It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd , who had returned , after an unprosperous marriage , to her father 's house , with the additional burden of two children . She was a clever young woman , who understood the art of pleasing -- the art of pleasing , at least , at Kellynch Hall ; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot , as to have been already staying there more than once , in spite of all that Lady Russell , who thought it a friendship quite out of place , could hint of caution and reserve .
Mr. Shepherd	From situation , Mrs Clay was , in Lady Russell 's estimate , a very unequal , and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion ; and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind , and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot 's reach , was therefore an object of first - rate importance .
Mr. Shepherd	"3 "" I must take leave to observe , Sir Walter , "" said Mr Shepherd one morning at Kellynch Hall , as he laid down the newspaper , "" that the present juncture is much in our favour ."
Mr. Shepherd	"Many a noble fortune has been made during the war . If a rich admiral were to come in our way , Sir Walter-- "" "" He would be a very lucky man , Shepherd , "" replied Sir Walter ; "" that 's all I have to remark ."
Mr. Shepherd	"A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him ; rather the greatest prize of all , let him have taken ever so many before ; hey , Shepherd ? """
Mr. Shepherd	"Mr Shepherd laughed , as he knew he must , at this wit , and then added-- "" I presume to observe , Sir Walter , that , in the way of business , gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with . I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business ; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions , and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with ."
Mr. Shepherd	"Therefore , Sir Walter , what I would take leave to suggest is , that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention ; which must be contemplated as a possible thing , because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other ; consequence has its tax ; I , John Shepherd , might conceal any family - matters that I chose , for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me ; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude ; and therefore , thus much I venture upon , that it will not greatly surprise me if , with all our caution , some rumour of the truth should get abroad ; in the supposition of which , as I was going to observe , since applications will unquestionably follow , I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to ; and beg leave to add , that two hours will bring me over at any time , to save you the trouble of replying . """
Mr. Shepherd	"but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure - grounds , is another thing . I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable ; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden . I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour , I assure you , be he sailor or soldier . "" After a short pause , Mr Shepherd presumed to say-- "" In all these cases , there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant . Your interest , Sir Walter , is in pretty safe hands ."
Mr. Shepherd	Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights .
Mr. Shepherd	"I venture to hint , that Sir Walter Elliot can not be half so jealous for his own , as John Shepherd will be for him . "" Here Anne spoke-- "" The navy , I think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give ."
Mr. Shepherd	"What Miss Anne says , is very true , "" was Mr Shepherd 's rejoinder , and "" Oh ! certainly , "" was his daughter 's"
Mr. Shepherd	A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line . One day last spring , in town , I was in company with two men , striking instances of what I am talking of ; Lord St Ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; I was to give place to Lord St Ives , and a certain Admiral Baldwin , the most deplorable - looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top . ` In the name of heaven , who is that old fellow ? ' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( Sir Basil Morley ) . ` Old fellow ! ' cried Sir Basil , ` it is Admiral Baldwin . What do you take his age to be ? '
Mr. Shepherd	` Sixty , ' said I , ` or perhaps sixty - two .
Mr. Shepherd	It seemed as if Mr Shepherd , in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter 's good will towards a naval officer as tenant , had been gifted with foresight ; for the very first application for the house was from an Admiral Croft , with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton ; and indeed , he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent .
Mr. Shepherd	By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make , Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire , who having acquired a very handsome fortune , was wishing to settle in his own country , and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood , which , however , had not suited him ; that accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold , Mr Shepherd observed , Sir Walter 's concerns could not be kept a secret,)-- accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let , and understanding his ( Mr Shepherd 's ) connection with the owner , he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries , and had , in the course of a pretty long conference , expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel ; and given Mr Shepherd , in his explicit account of himself , every proof of his being a most responsible , eligible tenant .
Mr. Shepherd	"Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman 's family , and mentioned a place ; and Anne , after the little pause which followed , added-- "" He is a rear admiral of the white ."
Mr. Shepherd	Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him , that Admiral Croft was a very hale , hearty , well - looking man , a little weather - beaten , to be sure , but not much , and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour ; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms , only wanted a comfortable home , and to get into it as soon as possible ; knew he must pay for his convenience ; knew what rent a ready - furnished house of that consequence might fetch ; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more ; had inquired about the manor ; would be glad of the deputation , certainly , but made no great point of it ; said he sometimes took out a gun , but never killed ; quite the gentleman .
Mr. Shepherd	Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral 's family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant . He was a married man , and without children ; the very state to be wished for .
Mr. Shepherd	"A house was never taken good care of , Mr Shepherd observed , without a lady : he did not know , whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady , as where there were many children . A lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world . He had seen Mrs Croft , too ; she was at Taunton with the admiral , and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over . "" And a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be , "" continued he ; "" asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the Admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , Sir Walter , I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford . Bless me !"
Mr. Shepherd	""" I have no conception whom you can mean , Shepherd ; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent . "" "" Bless me !"
Mr. Shepherd	I shall forget my own name soon , I suppose .
Mr. Shepherd	"A name that I am so very well acquainted with ; knew the gentleman so well by sight ; seen him a hundred times ; came to consult me once , I remember , about a trespass of one of his neighbours ; farmer 's man breaking into his orchard ; wall torn down ; apples stolen ; caught in the fact ; and afterwards , contrary to my judgement , submitted to an amicable compromise . Very odd indeed ! "" After waiting another moment-- "" You mean Mr Wentworth , I suppose ? "" said Anne ."
Mr. Shepherd	"Mr Shepherd was all gratitude . "" Wentworth was the very name !"
Mr. Shepherd	Came there about the year ---5 , I take it .
Mr. Shepherd	"You remember him , I am sure . "" "" Wentworth ?"
Mr. Shepherd	You misled me by the term gentleman .
Mr. Shepherd	I thought you were speaking of some man of property : Mr Wentworth was nobody , I remember ; quite unconnected ; nothing to do with the Strafford family .
Mr. Shepherd	"One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common . "" As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter 's estimate of the dues of a tenant . It succeeded , however ; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house , and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms , he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty , and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft , who still remained at Taunton , and fix a day for the house being seen ."
Mr. Shepherd	Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act ; and no sooner had
Mr. Shepherd	Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement , and saw nothing , therefore , but good manners in the other ; and with regard to the gentlemen , there was such an hearty good humour , such an open , trusting liberality on the Admiral 's side , as could not but influence Sir Walter , who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd 's assurances of his being known , by report , to the Admiral , as a model of good breeding .
Mr. Shepherd	"The house and grounds , and furniture , were approved , the Crofts were approved , terms , time , every thing , and every body , was right ; and Mr Shepherd 's clerks were set to work , without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that "" This indenture sheweth . """
Admiral Croft	It was three weeks since she had heard at all . She only knew that Henrietta was at home again ; and that Louisa , though considered to be recovering fast , was still in Lyme ; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening , when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to her ; and , to quicken the pleasure and surprise , with Admiral and Mrs Croft 's compliments .
Admiral Croft	I should have visited Admiral Croft , however , at any rate .
Admiral Croft	I know what is due to my tenant .
Admiral Croft	Anne could listen no longer ; she could not even have told how the poor Admiral 's complexion escaped ; her letter engrossed her .
Admiral Croft	Between ourselves , I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa ; it would have kept her a little out of his way .
Admiral Croft	I have this moment heard that the Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately ; they think the Admiral gouty .
Admiral Croft	In the first place , I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday , offering to convey anything to you ; a very kind , friendly note indeed , addressed to me , just as it ought ; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like . The Admiral does not seem very ill , and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants .
Admiral Croft	""" And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath ? "" "" They come on the Admiral 's account . He is thought to be gouty . """
Admiral Croft	"said Sir Walter . "" Poor old gentleman . "" "" Have they any acquaintance here ? "" asked Elizabeth ."
Admiral Croft	I do not know ; but I can hardly suppose that , at Admiral Croft 's time of life , and in his profession , he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this .
Admiral Croft	""" I suspect , "" said Sir Walter coolly , "" that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall ."
Admiral Croft	Elizabeth , may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place ?
Admiral Croft	The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street , perfectly to Sir Walter 's satisfaction . He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance , and did , in fact , think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral , than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him .
Admiral Croft	Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the Admiral 's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her . Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft 's arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend 's carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral .
Admiral Croft	He was standing by himself at a printshop window , with his hands behind him , in earnest contemplation of some print , and she not only might have passed him unseen , but was obliged to touch as well as address him
Admiral Croft	before she could catch his notice
Admiral Croft	When he did perceive and acknowledge her , however , it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour .
Admiral Croft	This is treating me like a friend .
Admiral Croft	Here I am , you see , staring at a picture .
Admiral Croft	I can never get by this shop without stopping .
Admiral Croft	"I wonder where that boat was built ! "" ( laughing heartily ) ; "" I would not venture over a horsepond in it ."
Admiral Croft	"Well , "" ( turning away ) , "" now , where are you bound ?"
Admiral Croft	Can I go anywhere for you , or with you ?
Admiral Croft	"Can I be of any use ? "" "" None , I thank you , unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together ."
Admiral Croft	Yes , yes we will have a snug walk together , and I have something to tell you as we go along .
Admiral Croft	We do not like our lodgings here the worse , I can tell you , for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth .
Admiral Croft	"The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way . "" When they were got a little farther , Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate . She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified ; but she was still obliged to wait , for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont ; and as she was not really Mrs Croft , she must let him have his own way ."
Admiral Croft	"As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont , he began-- "" Well , now you shall hear something that will surprise you ."
Admiral Croft	But first of all , you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about .
Admiral Croft	Her Christian name : I always forget her Christian name .
Admiral Croft	I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names .
Admiral Croft	"An excellent , good - hearted fellow , I assure you ; a very active , zealous officer too , which is more than you would think for , perhaps , for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice . """
Admiral Croft	""" Indeed you are mistaken there , sir ; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick 's manners ."
Admiral Croft	""" Well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality"
Admiral Croft	, Sophy and I can not help thinking Frederick 's manners better than his .
Admiral Croft	"She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other , not at all to represent Captain Benwick 's manners as the very best that could possibly be ; and , after a little hesitation , she was beginning to say , "" I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends , "" but the Admiral interrupted her with-- "" And the thing is certainly true . It is not a mere bit of gossip ."
Admiral Croft	"I fancy they are all at Uppercross . "" This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist ; she said , therefore , "" I hope , Admiral , I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth 's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy ."
Admiral Croft	It did seem , last autumn , as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove ; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally , and without violence .
Admiral Croft	"I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill - used man . "" "" Not at all , not at all ; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end . "" Anne looked down to hide her smile . "" No , no ; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that ."
Admiral Croft	""" Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to convey , but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther ."
Admiral Croft	She therefore satisfied herself with common - place remarks or quiet attention , and the Admiral had it all his own way .
Admiral Croft	""" Poor Frederick ! "" said he at last ."
Admiral Croft	I think we must get him to Bath .
Admiral Croft	Here are pretty girls enough , I am sure .
Admiral Croft	It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again , for that other Miss Musgrove , I find , is bespoke by her cousin , the young parson .
Admiral Croft	19 While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne , and expressing his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath , Captain Wentworth was already on his way thither .
Admiral Croft	Before Mrs Croft had written , he was arrived , and the very next time Anne walked out , she saw him .
Admiral Croft	It seemed as if Mr Shepherd , in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter 's good will towards a naval officer as tenant , had been gifted with foresight ; for the very first application for the house was from an Admiral Croft , with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton ; and indeed , he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent .

Admiral Croft	""" And who is Admiral Croft ? "" was Sir Walter 's cold suspicious inquiry ."
Admiral Croft	"Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman 's family , and mentioned a place ; and Anne , after the little pause which followed , added-- "" He is a rear admiral of the white ."
Admiral Croft	"He was in the Trafalgar action , and has been in the East Indies since ; he was stationed there , I believe , several years . "" "" Then I take it for granted , "" observed Sir Walter , "" that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery . """
Admiral Croft	Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him , that Admiral Croft was a very hale , hearty , well - looking man , a little weather - beaten , to be sure , but not much , and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour ; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms , only wanted a comfortable home , and to get into it as soon as possible ; knew he must pay for his convenience ; knew what rent a ready - furnished house of that consequence might fetch ; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more ; had inquired about the manor ; would be glad of the deputation , certainly , but made no great point of it ; said he sometimes took out a gun , but never killed ; quite the gentleman .
Admiral Croft	Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral 's family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant . He was a married man , and without children ; the very state to be wished for .
Admiral Croft	"A house was never taken good care of , Mr Shepherd observed , without a lady : he did not know , whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady , as where there were many children . A lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world . He had seen Mrs Croft , too ; she was at Taunton with the admiral , and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over . "" And a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be , "" continued he ; "" asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the Admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , Sir Walter , I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford . Bless me !"
Admiral Croft	Sir Walter was not very wise ; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel , that a more unobjectionable tenant , in all essentials , than Admiral Croft bid fair to be , could hardly offer .
Admiral Croft	"So far went his understanding ; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing , in the Admiral 's situation in life , which was just high enough , and not too high . """
Admiral Croft	"I have let my house to Admiral Croft , "" would sound extremely well ; very much better than to any mere Mr-- ; a Mr ( save , perhaps , some half dozen in the nation , ) always needs a note of explanation ."
Admiral Croft	She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell 's motives in this , over those of her father and Elizabeth ; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness ; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung ; and in the event of Admiral Croft 's really taking Kellynch Hall , she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her , of the past being known to
Admiral Croft	she believed , would ever be whispered , and in the trust that among his , the brother only with whom he had been residing , had received
Admiral Croft	""" Your first was the Asp , I remember ; we will look for the Asp . """
Admiral Croft	""" "" Phoo ! phoo ! "" cried the Admiral , "" what stuff these young fellows talk !"
Admiral Croft	""" "" I felt my luck , Admiral , I assure you ; "" replied Captain Wentworth , seriously ."
Admiral Croft	""" I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire ."
Admiral Croft	There can be no want of gallantry , Admiral , in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high , and this is what I do .
Admiral Croft	5 On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft 's seeing Kellynch Hall , Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell 's , and keep out of the way till all was over ; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them . This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory , and decided the whole business at once .
Admiral Croft	Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement , and saw nothing , therefore , but good manners in the other ; and with regard to the gentlemen , there was such an hearty good humour , such an open , trusting liberality on the Admiral 's side , as could not but influence Sir Walter , who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd 's assurances of his being known , by report , to the Admiral , as a model of good breeding .
Admiral Croft	"Sir Walter , without hesitation , declared the Admiral to be the best - looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and the Admiral , with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park , "" I thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at Taunton . The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him . """
Admiral Croft	It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds , and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into ; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village , and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived , she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne .
Mrs. Musgrove	14 Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge . They had left Louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them . They had been all in lodgings together .
Mrs. Musgrove	Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs Harville 's children away as much as she could , every possible supply from Uppercross had been furnished , to lighten the inconvenience to the Harvilles , while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day ; and in short , it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable .
Mrs. Musgrove	Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme . She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight . Anne enquired after Captain Benwick , Mary 's face was clouded directly . Charles laughed .
Mrs. Musgrove	Miss Harville only died last June . Such a heart is very little worth having ; is it , Lady Russell ?
Mrs. Musgrove	Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them . On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others . Charles and Mary also came in , of course , during their visit , and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell , and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain .
Mrs. Musgrove	But Mrs Musgrove , who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially , again and again , for all her attentions to them , concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing , with a happy glance round the room , that after all she had gone through , nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home .
Mrs. Musgrove	Her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home , before her brothers and sisters went to school again .
Mrs. Musgrove	The Harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at Uppercross , whenever she returned .
Mrs. Musgrove	No , these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures ; her spirits rose under their influence ; and like Mrs Musgrove , she was feeling , though not saying , that after being long in the country , nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness .
Mrs. Musgrove	But then , it had been taken up by his father and mother .
Mrs. Musgrove	His mother had some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see ; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding - clothes for herself and her sister ; and , in short , it ended in being his mother 's party , that everything might be comfortable and easy to Captain Harville ; and he and Mary were included in it by way of general convenience .
Mrs. Musgrove	""" I am extremely glad , indeed , "" cried Anne , "" particularly glad that this should happen ; and that of two sisters , who both deserve equally well , and who have always been such good friends , the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other-- that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort . I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both ."
Mrs. Musgrove	"Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ? "" He answered rather hesitatingly , "" Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different . If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab - chick in the water ; and Benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long ."
Mrs. Musgrove	"The visitors took their leave ; and Charles , having civilly seen them off , and then made a face at them , and abused them for coming , began with-- "" Well , mother , I have done something for you that you will like ."
Mrs. Musgrove	I know you love a play ; and there is room for us all .
Mrs. Musgrove	"Have not I done well , mother ? """
Mrs. Musgrove	"Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play , if Henrietta and all the others liked it , when Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming-- "" Good heavens , Charles ! how can you think of such a thing ?"
Mrs. Musgrove	Your father might have asked us to dinner , I think , if he had wanted to see us .
Mrs. Musgrove	You may do as you like , but I shall go to the play .
Mrs. Musgrove	Charles , I declare it will be too abominable if you do , when you promised to go .
Mrs. Musgrove	""" I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun . If I would not go for the sake of your father , I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir ."
Mrs. Musgrove	The careless expression was life to Anne , who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention , looking and listening with his whole soul ; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself . Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style ; he , half serious and half jesting , maintaining the scheme for the play , and she , invariably serious , most warmly opposing it , and not omitting to make it known that , however determined to go to Camden Place herself , she should not think herself very well used , if they went to the play without her . Mrs Musgrove interposed .
Mrs. Musgrove	"It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father 's ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us . """
Mrs. Musgrove	"Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness ; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying-- "" If it depended only on my inclination , ma'am , the party at home ( excepting on Mary 's account ) would not be the smallest impediment ."
Mrs. Musgrove	I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you .
Mrs. Musgrove	We have had a very dull Christmas ; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays . I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody .
Mrs. Musgrove	They are not at all nice children , in my opinion ; but Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well , if not better , than her grandchildren .
Mrs. Musgrove	Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey , which is not very likely , considering the care that will be taken of her ; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to - morrow .
Mrs. Musgrove	Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter . We are all very well pleased , however , for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth , it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter ; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent , and Captain Benwick is expected to - day
Mrs. Musgrove	23 One day only had passed since Anne 's conversation with Mrs Smith ; but a keener interest had succeeded , and she was now so little touched by Mr Elliot 's conduct , except by its effects in one quarter , that it became a matter of course the next morning , still to defer her explanatory visit in Rivers Street . She had promised to be with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner .
Mrs. Musgrove	The party before her were , Mrs Musgrove , talking to Mrs Croft , and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth ; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta , too impatient to wait , had gone out the moment it had cleared , but would be back again soon , and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned . She had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed . There was no delay , no waste of time .
Mrs. Musgrove	"She was deep in the happiness of such misery , or the misery of such happiness , instantly . Two minutes after her entering the room , Captain Wentworth said-- "" We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials . "" Materials were at hand , on a separate table ; he went to it , and nearly turning his back to them all , was engrossed by writing . Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter 's engagement , and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper ."
Mrs. Musgrove	"Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation , and yet , as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk , she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars ; such as , "" how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again"
Mrs. Musgrove	"to talk it over ; what my brother Hayter had said one day , and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next , and what had occurred to my sister Hayter , and what the young people had wished , and what I said at first I never could consent to , but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well , "" and a great deal in the same style of open - hearted communication : minutiae which , even with every advantage of taste and delicacy , which good Mrs Musgrove could not give , could be properly interesting only to the principals ."
Mrs. Musgrove	""" And so , ma'am , all these thing considered , "" said Mrs Musgrove , in her powerful whisper , "" though we could have wished it different , yet , altogether , we did not think it fair to stand out any longer , for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it , and Henrietta was pretty near as bad ; and so we thought they had better marry at once , and make the best of it , as many others have done before them ."
Mrs. Musgrove	At any rate , said I , it will be better than a long engagement .
Mrs. Musgrove	""" I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once , and have to struggle with a few difficulties together , than be involved in a long engagement . I always think that no mutual-- "" "" Oh ! dear Mrs Croft , "" cried Mrs Musgrove , unable to let her finish her speech , "" there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement ."
Mrs. Musgrove	It is what I always protested against for my children .
Mrs. Musgrove	"It is all very well , I used to say , for young people to be engaged , if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months , or even in twelve ; but a long engagement-- "" "" Yes , dear ma'am , "" said Mrs Croft , "" or an uncertain engagement , an engagement which may be long ."
Mrs. Musgrove	"The chair was earnestly protested against , and Mrs Musgrove , who thought only of one sort of illness , having assured herself with some anxiety , that there had been no fall in the case ; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down , and got a blow on her head ; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall ; could part with her cheerfully , and depend on finding her better at night . Anxious to omit no possible precaution , Anne struggled , and said-- "" I am afraid , ma'am , that it is not perfectly understood . Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening ."
Mrs. Musgrove	They were soon dining in company together at Mr Musgrove 's , for the little boy 's state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself ; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings .
Mrs. Musgrove	"There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party ; and he was very much questioned , and especially by the two Miss Musgroves , who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him , as to the manner of living on board , daily regulations , food , hours , & c. , and their surprise at his accounts , at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable , drew from him some pleasant ridicule , which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant , and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat , or any cook to dress it if there were , or any servant to wait , or any knife and fork to use . From thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Musgrove 's who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying-- "" Ah !"
Mrs. Musgrove	Miss Anne , if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son
Mrs. Musgrove	", I dare say he would have been just such another by this time . """
Mrs. Musgrove	Anne suppressed a smile , and listened kindly , while Mrs Musgrove relieved her heart a little more ; and for a few minutes , therefore , could not keep pace with the conversation of the others .
Mrs. Musgrove	""" And so then , I suppose , "" said Mrs Musgrove , in a low voice , as if thinking aloud , "" so then he went away to the Laconia , and there he met with our poor boy ."
Mrs. Musgrove	"Charles , my dear , "" ( beckoning him to her ) , "" do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother ."
Mrs. Musgrove	I always forgot .
Mrs. Musgrove	""" "" It was at Gibraltar , mother , I know ."
Mrs. Musgrove	"but , Charles , tell Captain Wentworth , he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me , for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend . """
Mrs. Musgrove	""" And I am sure , Sir . "" said Mrs Musgrove , "" it was a lucky day for us , when you were put captain into that ship ."
Mrs. Musgrove	"We shall never forget what you did . "" Her feelings made her speak low ; and Captain Wentworth , hearing only in part , and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts , looked rather in suspense , and as if waiting for more ."
Mrs. Musgrove	""" My brother , "" whispered one of the girls ; "" mamma is thinking of poor Richard . """
Mrs. Musgrove	""" Poor dear fellow ! "" continued Mrs Musgrove ; "" he was grown so steady , and such an excellent correspondent , while he was under your care ! Ah !"
Mrs. Musgrove	"I assure you , Captain Wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you . "" There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth 's face at this speech , a certain glance of his bright eye , and curl of his handsome mouth , which convinced Anne , that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove 's kind wishes , as to her son , he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him ; but it was too transient an indulgence of self - amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself ; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious , and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa , on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting , took a place by the latter , and entered into conversation with her , in a low voice , about her son , doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace , as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent 's feelings . They were actually on the same sofa , for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him ; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove ."
Mrs. Musgrove	Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable , substantial size , infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour , than tenderness and sentiment ; and while the agitations of Anne 's slender form , and pensive face , may be considered as very completely screened , Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self - command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son , whom alive nobody had cared for . Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions .
Mrs. Musgrove	The Admiral , after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him , being called to order by his wife , now came up to Captain Wentworth , and without any observation of what he might be interrupting , thinking only of his own thoughts , began with--
Mrs. Musgrove	""" What a great traveller you must have been , ma'am ! "" said Mrs Musgrove to Mrs Croft ."
Mrs. Musgrove	""" Pretty well , ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage ; though many women have done more ."
Mrs. Musgrove	"We do not call Bermuda or Bahama , you know , the West Indies . "" Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent ; she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life ."
Mrs. Musgrove	""" And I do assure you , ma'am , "" pursued Mrs Croft , "" that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man - of - war ; I speak , you know , of the higher rates ."
Mrs. Musgrove	""" Aye , to be sure . Yes , indeed , oh yes ! I am quite of your opinion , Mrs Croft , "" was Mrs Musgrove 's hearty answer ."
Mrs. Musgrove	I am quite of your opinion .
Mrs. Musgrove	"I know what it is , for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes , and I am so glad when they are over , and he is safe back again . """
Mrs. Musgrove	"Unintentionally she returned to that part of the room ; he saw her , and , instantly rising , said , with studied politeness-- "" I beg your pardon , madam , this is your seat ; "" and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative , he was not to be induced to sit down again . Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches ."
Mrs. Musgrove	The remainder of Anne 's time at Uppercross , comprehending only two days , was spent entirely at the Mansion House ; and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there , both as an immediate companion , and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future , which , in Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's distressed state of spirits , would have been difficulties .
Mrs. Musgrove	A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne , and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery - maid of the family , one who having brought up all the children , and seen the very last , the lingering and long - petted Master Harry , sent to school after his brothers , was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her , and who , consequently , was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa . Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither , had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta ; but without Anne , it would hardly have been resolved on , and found practicable so soon .
Mrs. Musgrove	""" Nothing remarkable . One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one 's own . Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me , and we were so crowded ! They are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward ."
Mrs. Musgrove	""" I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves . """
Henrietta Musgrove	I can not pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine -- I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it ; and then ` Miss Elliot ' was spoken of in the highest terms !
Henrietta Musgrove	Henrietta remained with Louisa ; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters .
Henrietta Musgrove	Though neither Henrietta , nor Louisa , nor Charles Hayter , nor Captain Wentworth were there , the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in .
Henrietta Musgrove	She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove , Henrietta , and Captain Harville , beside their two selves .
Henrietta Musgrove	His mother had some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see ; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding - clothes for herself and her sister ; and , in short , it ended in being his mother 's party , that everything might be comfortable and easy to Captain Harville ; and he and Mary were included in it by way of general convenience .
Henrietta Musgrove	Anne 's only surprise was , that affairs should be in forwardness enough for Henrietta 's wedding - clothes to be talked of . She had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand ; but she learned from Charles that , very recently , ( since Mary 's last letter to herself ) , Charles Hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years ; and that on the strength of his present income , with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question , the two families had consented to the young people 's wishes , and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months , quite as soon as Louisa 's .
Henrietta Musgrove	Mary does not above half like Henrietta 's match .
Henrietta Musgrove	But she does not do him justice , nor think enough about Winthrop .
Henrietta Musgrove	Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning ; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary , to go and see her and Henrietta directly . Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present .
Henrietta Musgrove	Henrietta was exactly in that state of recently - improved views , of fresh - formed happiness , which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all ; and Mrs Musgrove 's real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress .
Henrietta Musgrove	It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on Charles 's leaving them together , was listening to Mrs Musgrove 's history of Louisa , and to Henrietta 's of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which Mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill - used by anybody ; which Mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining .
Henrietta Musgrove	"Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play , if Henrietta and all the others liked it , when Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming-- "" Good heavens , Charles ! how can you think of such a thing ?"
Henrietta Musgrove	"It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father 's ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us . """
Henrietta Musgrove	Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne 's imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour ; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered , she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta , eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out , and calling on her companions to lose no time , lest somebody else should come in .
Henrietta Musgrove	Anne talked of being perfectly ready , and tried to look it ; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair , in preparing to quit the room , she would have found , in all her own sensations for her cousin , in the very security of his affection , wherewith to pity her . Their preparations , however , were stopped short .
Henrietta Musgrove	It was three weeks since she had heard at all . She only knew that Henrietta was at home again ; and that Louisa , though considered to be recovering fast , was still in Lyme ; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening , when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to her ; and , to quicken the pleasure and surprise , with Admiral and Mrs Croft 's compliments .
Henrietta Musgrove	Between ourselves , I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa ; it would have kept her a little out of his way .
Henrietta Musgrove	They had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since Henrietta 's coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and Louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable .
Henrietta Musgrove	The party before her were , Mrs Musgrove , talking to Mrs Croft , and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth ; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta , too impatient to wait , had gone out the moment it had cleared , but would be back again soon , and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned . She had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed . There was no delay , no waste of time .
Henrietta Musgrove	""" And so , ma'am , all these thing considered , "" said Mrs Musgrove , in her powerful whisper , "" though we could have wished it different , yet , altogether , we did not think it fair to stand out any longer , for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it , and Henrietta was pretty near as bad ; and so we thought they had better marry at once , and make the best of it , as many others have done before them ."
Henrietta Musgrove	""" Yes , and you may guess who it is for . But , "" ( in a deep tone , ) "" it was not done for her ."
Henrietta Musgrove	"And with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding , "" Poor Fanny !"
Henrietta Musgrove	she would not have forgotten him so soon !
Henrietta Musgrove	""" It was not in her nature ."
Henrietta Musgrove	She doted on him .
Henrietta Musgrove	And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation , Charles , Mary , and Henrietta all came in .
Henrietta Musgrove	12 Anne and Henrietta , finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning , agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast .
Henrietta Musgrove	"They went to the sands , to watch the flowing of the tide , which a fine south - easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted . They praised the morning ; gloried in the sea ; sympathized in the delight of the fresh - feeling breeze -- and were silent ; till Henrietta suddenly began again with-- "" Oh ! yes,--I am quite convinced that , with very few exceptions , the sea - air always does good ."
Henrietta Musgrove	Now , I can not help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea .
Henrietta Musgrove	I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely , and fix at Lyme . Do not you , Anne ? Do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and Mrs Shirley ?
Henrietta Musgrove	She has cousins here , you know , and many acquaintance , which would make it cheerful for her , and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand , in case of his having another seizure .
Henrietta Musgrove	Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley , who have been doing good all their lives , wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross , where , excepting our family , they seem shut out from all the world .
Henrietta Musgrove	I wish his friends would propose it to him .
Henrietta Musgrove	I really think they ought .
Henrietta Musgrove	My only doubt is , whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish . He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions ; over - scrupulous I must say .
Henrietta Musgrove	"She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business ; felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought ; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active , respectable young man , as a resident curate , and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate 's being married . "" I wish , "" said Henrietta , very well pleased with her companion , "" I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross , and were intimate with Dr Shirley . I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody !"
Henrietta Musgrove	I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything !
Henrietta Musgrove	"I am afraid of her , as I have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but I respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross . """
Henrietta Musgrove	Anne was amused by Henrietta 's manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta 's views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them .
Henrietta Musgrove	Anne , must not it be our Mr Elliot ? my father 's next heir ?
Henrietta Musgrove	"I think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him . "" Anne avoided a direct reply , but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated , but as what ought to be suppressed . The offence which had been given her father , many years back , she knew ; Elizabeth 's particular share in it she suspected ; and that Mr Elliot 's idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt ."
Henrietta Musgrove	Mary never wrote to Bath herself ; all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell on Anne .
Henrietta Musgrove	I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him ; he sent in letters , but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth .
Henrietta Musgrove	not I. I would as soon have been run up to the yard - arm .
Henrietta Musgrove	Anne , attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to Henrietta , still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet Mary , to animate Charles , to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth .
Henrietta Musgrove	Charles , Henrietta , and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation , and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror .
Henrietta Musgrove	So far it was decided ; and Henrietta at first declared the same .
Henrietta Musgrove	She , however , was soon persuaded to think differently . The usefulness of her staying !
Henrietta Musgrove	She who had not been able to remain in Louisa 's room , or to look at her , without sufferings which made her worse than helpless !
Henrietta Musgrove	She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good , yet was still unwilling to be away , till , touched by the thought of her father and mother , she gave it up ; she consented , she was anxious to be at home .
Henrietta Musgrove	Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of Mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , Charles taking care of his sister , and Captain Benwick attending to her . She gave a moment 's recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . There she had listened to Henrietta 's schemes for Dr Shirley 's leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen Mr Elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa , or those who were wrapt up in her welfare . Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance .
Henrietta Musgrove	Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home , to stay as long as he liked , being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral 's fraternal kindness as of his wife 's .
Henrietta Musgrove	There was so much of friendliness , and of flattery , and of everything most bewitching in his reception there ; the old were so hospitable , the young so agreeable , that he could not but resolve to remain where he was , and take all the charms and perfections of Edward 's wife upon credit a little longer .
Henrietta Musgrove	The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come , particularly in the morning , when he had no companion at home , for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together , interesting themselves in their new possessions , their grass , and their sheep , and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person , or driving out in a gig , lately added to their establishment .
Henrietta Musgrove	Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies . It was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way . Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins , and a very amiable , pleasing young man , between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth 's introduction . He was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father 's house , only two miles from Uppercross .
Henrietta Musgrove	Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters .
Henrietta Musgrove	Mr Hayter had some property of his own , but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove 's ; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country , the young Hayters would , from their parents ' inferior , retired , and unpolished way of living , and their own defective education , have been hardly in any class at all , but for their connexion with Uppercross , this eldest son of course excepted , who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman , and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest .
Henrietta Musgrove	The two families had always been on excellent terms , there being no pride on one side , and no envy on the other , and only such a consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves , as made them pleased to improve their cousins . Charles 's attentions to Henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation .
Henrietta Musgrove	""" It would not be a great match for her ; but if Henrietta liked him,""-- and Henrietta did seem to like him ."
Henrietta Musgrove	Henrietta fully thought so herself , before Captain Wentworth came ; but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten .
Henrietta Musgrove	Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful , as far as Anne 's observation reached .
Henrietta Musgrove	Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest , Louisa had the higher spirits ; and she knew not now , whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him .
Henrietta Musgrove	"Mr and Mrs Musgrove , either from seeing little , or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters , and of all the young men who came near them , seemed to leave everything to take its chance . There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion - house ; but it was different at the Cottage : the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder ; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves ' company , and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared , when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister , as to which was the one liked best . Charles gave it for Louisa , Mary for Henrietta , but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful . Charles "" had never seen a pleasanter man in his life ; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say , was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war ."
Henrietta Musgrove	""" "" Upon my word it would , "" replied Mary ."
Henrietta Musgrove	""" Dear me ! If he should rise to any very great honours ! If he should ever be made a baronet !"
Henrietta Musgrove	That would be a noble thing , indeed , for Henrietta !
Henrietta Musgrove	She would take place of me then , and Henrietta would not dislike that .
Henrietta Musgrove	"It would be but a new creation , however , and I never think much of your new creations . """
Henrietta Musgrove	It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very account of Charles Hayter , whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to . She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters , and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed -- very sad for herself and her children .
Henrietta Musgrove	""" You know , "" said she , "" I can not think him at all a fit match for Henrietta ; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made , she has no right to throw herself away ."
Henrietta Musgrove	I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family , and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them . And , pray , who is Charles Hayter ?
Henrietta Musgrove	A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross .
Henrietta Musgrove	""" Her husband , however , would not agree with her here ; for besides having a regard for his cousin , Charles Hayter was an eldest son , and he saw things as an eldest son himself . "" Now you are taking nonsense , Mary , "" was therefore his answer ."
Henrietta Musgrove	""" It would not be a great match for Henrietta , but Charles has"
Henrietta Musgrove	a very fair chance , through the Spicers , of getting something from the Bishop in the course of a year or two ; and you will please to remember , that he is the eldest son ; whenever my uncle dies , he steps into very pretty property .
Henrietta Musgrove	The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres , besides the farm near Taunton , which is some of the best land in the country . I grant you , that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta , and indeed it could not be ; he is the only one that could be possible ; but he is a very good - natured , good sort of a fellow ; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands , he will make a different sort of place of it , and live in a very different sort of way ; and with that property , he will never be a contemptible man -- good , freehold property .
Henrietta Musgrove	"; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter ; and if she has him , and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth , I shall be very well satisfied . """
Henrietta Musgrove	""" Charles may say what he pleases , "" cried Mary to Anne , as soon as he was out of the room , "" but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter ; a very bad thing for her , and still worse for me ; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head , and I have very little doubt"
Henrietta Musgrove	She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday .
Henrietta Musgrove	I wish you had been there to see her behaviour .
Henrietta Musgrove	And as to Captain Wentworth 's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta , it is nonsense to say so ; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best .
Henrietta Musgrove	"I wish you had been with us yesterday , for then you might have decided between us ; and I am sure you would have thought as I did , unless you had been determined to give it against me . "" A dinner at Mr Musgrove 's had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne ; but she had staid at home , under the mixed plea of a headache of her own , and some return of indisposition in little Charles . She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth ; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening ."
Henrietta Musgrove	As to Captain Wentworth 's views , she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister , or impeaching his own honour , than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa , or Louisa to Henrietta . Either of them would , in all probability , make him an affectionate , good - humoured wife .
Henrietta Musgrove	With regard to Charles Hayter , she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well - meaning young woman , and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned ; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings , the alternation could not be understood too soon . Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin 's behaviour . She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause .
Henrietta Musgrove	He had been absent only two Sundays , and when they parted , had left her interested , even to the height of his wishes , in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy , and obtaining that of Uppercross instead . It had then seemed the object nearest her heart , that Dr Shirley , the rector , who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office , but was now growing too infirm for many of them , should be quite fixed on engaging a curate ; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford , and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it . The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross , instead of going six miles another way ; of his having , in every respect , a better curacy ; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley , and of dear , good Dr Shirley 's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue , had been a great deal , even to Louisa , but had been almost everything to Henrietta . When he came back , alas !
Henrietta Musgrove	"Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley : she was at a window , looking out for Captain Wentworth ; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give , and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation . """
Henrietta Musgrove	Well , I am very glad indeed :
Henrietta Musgrove	but I always thought you would have it ; I always thought you sure .
Henrietta Musgrove	"It did not appear to me that -- in short , you know , Dr Shirley must have a curate , and you had secured his promise . Is he coming , Louisa ? """
Henrietta Musgrove	One morning , very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves , at which Anne had not been present , Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing - room at the Cottage , where were only herself and the little invalid Charles , who was lying on the sofa .
Henrietta Musgrove	"The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot , deprived his manners of their usual composure : he started , and could only say , "" I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here : Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here , "" before he walked to the window to recollect himself , and feel how he ought to behave . "" They are up stairs with my sister : they will be down in a few moments , I dare say , "" had been Anne 's reply , in all the confusion that was natural ; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him , she would have been out of the room the next moment , and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself ."
Henrietta Musgrove	"He continued at the window ; and after calmly and politely saying , "" I hope the little boy is better , "" was silent ."
Henrietta Musgrove	She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa , and remain there to satisfy her patient ; and thus they continued a few minutes , when , to her very great satisfaction , she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule .
Henrietta Musgrove	She hoped , on turning her head , to see the master of the house ; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy -- Charles Hayter , probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne .
Henrietta Musgrove	"She only attempted to say , "" How do you do ?"
Henrietta Musgrove	"There being nothing to eat , he could only have some play ; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother , he began to fasten himself upon her , as she knelt , in such a way that , busy as she was about Charles , she could not shake him off . She spoke to him , ordered , entreated , and insisted in vain . Once she did contrive to push him away , but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly . "" Walter , "" said she , "" get down this moment ."
Henrietta Musgrove	"I am very angry with you . "" "" Walter , "" cried Charles Hayter , "" why do you not do as you are bid ?"
Henrietta Musgrove	Do not you hear your aunt speak ?
Henrietta Musgrove	In another moment , however , she found herself in the state of being released from him ; some one was taking him from her , though he had bent down her head so much , that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck , and he was resolutely borne away , before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it .
Henrietta Musgrove	Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless . She could not even thank him . She could only hang over little Charles , with most disordered feelings .
Henrietta Musgrove	His kindness in stepping forward to her relief , the manner , the silence in which it had passed , the little particulars of the circumstance , with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child , that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks , and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants , produced such a confusion of varying , but very painful agitation , as she could not recover from , till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares , and leave the room . She could not stay .
Henrietta Musgrove	It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four-- they were now altogether ; but she could stay for none of it .
Henrietta Musgrove	"She had a strong impression of his having said , in a vext tone of voice , after Captain Wentworth 's interference , "" You ought to have minded me , Walter ; I told you not to teaze your aunt ; "" and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself ."
Henrietta Musgrove	But neither Charles Hayter 's feelings , nor anybody 's feelings , could interest her , till she had a little better arranged her own . She was ashamed of herself , quite ashamed of being so nervous , so overcome by such a trifle ; but so it was , and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her .
Henrietta Musgrove	"So , there was I , crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louise ; and I think it very likely that my illness to - day may be owing to it . """
Henrietta Musgrove	Their children had more modern minds and manners . There was a numerous family ; but the only two grown up , excepting Charles , were Henrietta and Louisa , young ladies of nineteen and twenty , who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments , and were now like thousands of other young ladies , living to be fashionable , happy , and merry . Their dress had every advantage , their faces were rather pretty , their spirits extremely good , their manner unembarrassed and pleasant ; they were of consequence at home , and favourites abroad .
Mrs. Clay	She was concerned for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling ; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister , and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils , without knowing how to avert any one of them . She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him .
Mrs. Clay	She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith , but here was a reward indeed springing from it !
Mrs. Clay	Mrs Smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done .
Mrs. Clay	She must talk to Lady Russell , tell her , consult with her , and having done her best , wait the event with as much composure as possible ; and after all , her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell ; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself .
Mrs. Clay	""" I had not the smallest intention of asking him , "" said Elizabeth , with affected carelessness , "" but he gave so many hints ; so Mrs Clay says , at least . "" "" Indeed , I do say it ."
Mrs. Clay	""" "" Quite delightful ! "" cried Mrs Clay , not daring , however , to turn her eyes towards Anne ."
Mrs. Clay	"Dear Miss Elliot , may I not say father and son ? "" "" Oh !"
Mrs. Clay	""" "" My dear Miss Elliot ! "" exclaimed Mrs Clay , lifting her hands and eyes , and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence ."
Mrs. Clay	""" Well , my dear Penelope , you need not be so alarmed about him ."
Mrs. Clay	Anne admired the good acting of the friend , in being able to shew such pleasure as she did , in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object .
Mrs. Clay	It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight of Mr Elliot ; and yet she could assume a most obliging , placid look , and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done otherwise .
Mrs. Clay	His attentive deference to her father , contrasted with his former language , was odious ; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith , she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness , or the sound of his artificial good sentiments . She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side . It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat ; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship ; and to retrace , as quietly as she could , the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along . She was accordingly more guarded , and more cool , than she had been the night before .
Mrs. Clay	He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised ; wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation ; but the charm was broken
Mrs. Clay	: he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin 's vanity ; he found , at least , that it was not to be done now , by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too - commanding claims of the others . He little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest , bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable .
Mrs. Clay	She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath the next morning , going early , and that he would be gone the greater part of two days .
Mrs. Clay	It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her ; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party , seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort . It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and Elizabeth ; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them ! Mrs Clay 's selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his ; and Anne would have compounded for the marriage at once , with all its evils , to be clear of Mr Elliot 's subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it .
Mrs. Clay	On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell , and accomplish the necessary communication ; and she would have gone directly after breakfast , but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble , which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion . She saw Mrs Clay fairly off , therefore , before she began to talk of spending the morning in Rivers Street .
Mrs. Clay	you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me , and pretend I have read it through .
Mrs. Clay	Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications .
Mrs. Clay	You need not tell her so , but I thought her dress hideous the other night .
Mrs. Clay	I used to think she had some taste in dress , but I was ashamed of her at the concert .
Mrs. Clay	Something so formal and arrange in her air !
Mrs. Clay	"and she sits so upright ! My best love , of course . "" "" And mine , "" added Sir Walter ."
Mrs. Clay	And you may say , that I mean to call upon her soon .
Mrs. Clay	Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card . Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life , who make themselves up so little . If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen ; but last time I called , I observed the blinds were let down immediately .
Mrs. Clay	They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove , and were at the White Hart . So much was pretty soon understood ; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing - room , and regaling themselves with her admiration , Anne could not draw upon Charles 's brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary , as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of .
Mrs. Clay	She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove , Henrietta , and Captain Harville , beside their two selves .
Mrs. Clay	He had begun to talk of it a week ago ; and by way of doing something , as shooting was over , Charles had proposed coming with him , and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it
Mrs. Clay	very much , as an advantage to her husband
Mrs. Clay	Mrs Harville , her children , and Captain Benwick , remained with Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross .
Mrs. Clay	"These were her internal persuasions : "" Old fashioned notions ; country hospitality ; we do not profess to give dinners ; few people in Bath do ; Lady Alicia never does ; did not even ask her own sister 's family , though they were here a month : and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove ; put her quite out of her way ."
Mrs. Clay	I am sure she would rather not come ; she can not feel easy with us .
Mrs. Clay	Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning ; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary , to go and see her and Henrietta directly . Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present .
Mrs. Clay	They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within , and by themselves , and Anne had the kindest welcome from each .
Mrs. Clay	Henrietta was exactly in that state of recently - improved views , of fresh - formed happiness , which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all ; and Mrs Musgrove 's real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress .
Mrs. Clay	It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on Charles 's leaving them together , was listening to Mrs Musgrove 's history of Louisa , and to Henrietta 's of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which Mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill - used by anybody ; which Mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining .
Mrs. Clay	A large party in an hotel ensured a quick - changing , unsettled scene . One five minutes brought a note , the next a parcel ; and Anne had not been there half an hour , when their dining - room , spacious as it was , seemed more than half filled : a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove , and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth .
Mrs. Clay	""" Anne , "" cried Mary , still at her window , "" there is Mrs Clay , I am sure , standing under the colonnade , and a gentleman with her ."
Mrs. Clay	"She was just in time to ascertain that it really was Mr Elliot , which she had never believed , before he disappeared on one side , as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other ; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest , she calmly said , "" Yes , it is Mr Elliot , certainly . He has changed his hour of going , I suppose , that is all , or I may be mistaken , I might not attend ; "" and walked back to her chair , recomposed , and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well ."
Mrs. Clay	It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day ; Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife , by persisting that he would go to the play to - morrow if nobody else would .
Mrs. Clay	Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning , therefore , she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place , there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow 's party , the frequent enumeration of the persons invited , and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath , while harassing herself with the never - ending question , of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not ?
Mrs. Clay	She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation , to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath , for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself , she determined to mention it , and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs Clay 's face as she listened .
Mrs. Clay	It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her ; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party , seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort . It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and Elizabeth ; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them ! Mrs Clay 's selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his ; and Anne would have compounded for the marriage at once , with all its evils , to be clear of Mr Elliot 's subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it .
Mrs. Clay	What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth !
Mrs. Clay	Does she never mean to go away ? But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant , we might not be invited . Let me know what you think of this .
Mrs. Clay	This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth 's share of interest in the letter ; when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove , and her fine little boys , Anne was at liberty . In her own room , she tried to comprehend it .
Mrs. Clay	Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the Admiral 's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her . Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft 's arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend 's carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral .
Mrs. Clay	""" "" They would look around them , no doubt , and bless their good fortune , "" said Mrs Clay , for Mrs Clay was present : her father had driven her over , nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay 's health as a drive to Kellynch : "" but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant ."
Mrs. Clay	I have known a good deal of the profession ; and besides their liberality , they are so neat and careful in all their ways !
Mrs. Clay	"It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once , before they reach Admiral Baldwin 's age . "" "" Nay , Sir Walter , "" cried Mrs Clay , "" this is being severe indeed ."
Mrs. Clay	The sea is no beautifier , certainly ; sailors do grow old betimes ; I have observed it ; they soon lose the look of youth .
Mrs. Clay	""" But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot , that she did not hear the appeal ."
Mrs. Clay	""" I have no conception whom you can mean , Shepherd ; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent . "" "" Bless me !"
Mrs. Clay	Mrs Clay was very pleasant , and very smiling , but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course .
Mrs. Clay	Anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival , but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for .
Mrs. Clay	They were evidently in excellent spirits , and she was soon to listen to the causes .
Mrs. Clay	His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis 's companion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis , and certainly was not sandy - haired .
Mrs. Clay	"Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot 's knock . """
Mrs. Clay	Mrs Clay was right .
Mrs. Clay	She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell , in the wish of really comprehending what had passed , and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it .
