Character	Assertion
Fanny Price	The conference was neither so short nor so conclusive as the lady had designed .
Fanny Price	He had vanity , which strongly inclined him in the first place to think she did love him , though she might not know it herself ; and which , secondly , when constrained at last to admit that she did know her own present feelings , convinced him that he should be able in time to make those feelings what he wished .
Fanny Price	He was in love , very much in love ; and it was a love which , operating on an active , sanguine spirit , of more warmth than delicacy , made her affection appear of greater consequence because it was withheld , and determined him to have the glory , as well as the felicity , of forcing her to love him .
Fanny Price	He had every well - grounded reason for solid attachment ; he knew her to have all the worth that could justify the warmest hopes of lasting happiness with her ; her conduct at this very time , by speaking the disinterestedness and delicacy of her character ( qualities which he believed most rare indeed ) , was of a sort to heighten all his wishes , and confirm all his resolutions .
Fanny Price	He considered her rather as one who had never thought on the subject enough to be in danger ; who had been guarded by youth , a youth of mind as lovely as of person ; whose modesty had prevented her from understanding his attentions , and who was still overpowered by the suddenness of addresses so wholly unexpected , and the novelty of a situation which her fancy had never taken into account .
Fanny Price	Love such as his , in a man like himself , must with perseverance secure a return , and at no great distance ; and he had so much delight in the idea of obliging her to love him in a very short time , that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted .
Fanny Price	To Fanny , however , who had known too much opposition all her life to find any charm in it , all this was unintelligible .
Fanny Price	She found that he did mean to persevere ; but how he could , after such language from her as she felt herself obliged to use , was not to be understood .
Fanny Price	She told him that she did not love him , could not love him , was sure she never should love him ; that such a change was quite impossible ; that the subject was most painful to her ; that she must entreat him never to mention it again , to allow her to leave him at once , and let it be considered as concluded for ever .
Fanny Price	And when farther pressed , had added , that in her opinion their dispositions were so totally dissimilar as to make mutual affection incompatible ; and that they were unfitted for each other by nature , education , and habit .
Fanny Price	All this she had said , and with the earnestness of sincerity ; yet this was not enough , for he immediately denied there being anything uncongenial in their characters , or anything unfriendly in their situations ; and positively declared , that he would still love , and still hope !
Fanny Price	Fanny knew her own meaning , but was no judge of her own manner .
Fanny Price	Her
Fanny Price	manner was incurably gentle ; and she was not aware how much it concealed the sternness of her purpose .
Fanny Price	Her diffidence , gratitude , and softness made every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of self - denial ; seem , at least , to be giving nearly as much pain to herself as to him .
Fanny Price	Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who , as the clandestine , insidious , treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram , had been her abhorrence , whom she had hated to see or to speak to , in whom she could believe no good quality to exist , and whose power , even of being agreeable , she had barely acknowledged .
Fanny Price	He was now the Mr. Crawford who was addressing herself with ardent , disinterested love ; whose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and upright , whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of attachment ; who was pouring out his sense of her merits , describing and describing again his affection , proving as far as words could prove it , and in the language , tone , and spirit of a man of talent too , that he sought her for her gentleness and her goodness ; and to complete the whole , he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William ’s promotion ! Here was a change , and here were claims which could not but operate !
Fanny Price	She might have disdained him in all the dignity of angry virtue , in the grounds of Sotherton , or the theatre at Mansfield Park ; but he approached her now with rights that demanded different treatment .
Fanny Price	She must be courteous , and she must be compassionate .
Fanny Price	She must have a sensation of being honoured , and whether thinking of herself or her brother , she must have a strong feeling of gratitude .
Fanny Price	The effect of the whole was a manner so pitying and agitated , and words intermingled with her refusal so expressive of obligation and concern , that to a temper of vanity and hope like Crawford ’s , the truth , or at least the strength of her indifference , might well be questionable ; and he was not so irrational as Fanny considered him , in the professions of persevering , assiduous , and not desponding attachment which closed the interview .
Fanny Price	It was with reluctance that he suffered her to go ; but there was no look of despair in parting to belie his words , or give her hopes of his being less unreasonable than he professed himself .
Fanny Price	Now she was angry .
Fanny Price	Here was again a want of delicacy and regard for others which had formerly so struck and disgusted her .
Fanny Price	Here was again a something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated before .
Fanny Price	her
Fanny Price	So thought Fanny , in good truth and sober sadness , as she sat musing over that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs : wondering at the past and present ; wondering at what was yet to come , and in a nervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of her being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford , and the felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it .
Fanny Price	The first feeling was disappointment : he had hoped better things ; he had thought that an hour ’s entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked so little change on a gentle - tempered girl like Fanny ; but there was
Fanny Price	Mr. Crawford ’s steadiness was honoured , and Fanny was praised , and the connexion was still the most desirable in the world .
Fanny Price	In all his niece ’s family and friends , there could be but one opinion , one wish on the subject ; the influence of all who loved her must incline one way . Everything was said that could encourage , every encouragement received with grateful joy , and the gentlemen parted the best of friends .
Fanny Price	Satisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most proper and hopeful , Sir Thomas resolved to abstain from all farther importunity with his niece , and to shew no open interference .
Fanny Price	Upon her disposition he believed kindness might be the best way of working .
Fanny Price	The forbearance of her family on a point , respecting which she could be in no doubt of their wishes , might be their surest means of forwarding it .
Fanny Price	Accordingly , on this principle , Sir Thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her , with a mild gravity , intended to be overcoming , “ Well , Fanny , I have seen Mr. Crawford again , and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you .
Fanny Price	you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common character ; though , young as you are , and little acquainted with the transient , varying , unsteady nature of love , as it generally exists , you can not be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against discouragement .
Fanny Price	“ Indeed , sir , ” said Fanny , “ I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should continue to — I know that it is paying me a very great compliment , and I feel most undeservedly honoured ; but I am so perfectly convinced , and I
Fanny Price	told him so , that it never will be in my power —
Fanny Price	” “ My dear , ” interrupted Sir Thomas , “ there is no occasion for this .
Fanny Price	Your feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you .
Fanny Price	You will have nothing to fear , or to be agitated about .
Fanny Price	You can not suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations .
Fanny Price	Your happiness and advantage are all that I have in view , and nothing is required of you but to bear with Mr. Crawford ’s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his .
Fanny Price	You are on safe ground .
Fanny Price	I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls , as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred .
Fanny Price	You will see him with the rest of us , in the same manner , and , as much as you can , dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant .
Fanny Price	And now , my dear Fanny , this subject is closed between us .
Fanny Price	The promised departure was all that Fanny could think of with much satisfaction .
Fanny Price	Her uncle ’s kind expressions , however , and forbearing manner , were sensibly felt ; and when she considered how much of the
Fanny Price	truth was unknown to him , she believed she had no right to wonder at the line of conduct he pursued .
Fanny Price	She must do her duty , and trust that time might make her duty easier than it now was .
Fanny Price	She could not , though only eighteen , suppose Mr. Crawford ’s attachment would hold out for ever ; she could not but imagine that steady , unceasing discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time .
Fanny Price	How much time she might , in her own fancy , allot for its dominion , is another concern .
Fanny Price	In spite of his intended silence , Sir Thomas found himself once more obliged to mention the subject to his niece , to prepare her briefly for its being imparted to her aunts ; a measure which he would still have avoided , if possible , but which became necessary from the totally opposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding .
Fanny Price	When Sir Thomas understood this , he felt the necessity of making his own wife and sister - in - law acquainted with the business without delay ; though , on Fanny ’s account , he almost dreaded the effect of the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself .
Fanny Price	He deprecated her mistaken but well - meaning zeal .
Fanny Price	Sir Thomas , indeed , was , by this time , not very far from classing Mrs. Norris as one of those well - meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable things .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Norris , however , relieved him .
Fanny Price	He pressed for the strictest forbearance and silence towards their niece ; she not only promised , but did observe it .
Fanny Price	She only looked her increased ill - will .
Fanny Price	Angry she was : bitterly angry ; but she was more angry with Fanny for having received such an offer than for refusing it .
Fanny Price	It was an injury and affront to Julia , who ought to have been Mr. Crawford ’s choice ; and , independently of that , she disliked Fanny , because she had neglected her ; and she would have grudged such an elevation to one whom she had been always trying to depress .
Fanny Price	Sir Thomas gave her more credit for discretion on the occasion than she deserved ; and Fanny could have blessed her for allowing her only to see her displeasure , and not to hear it .
Fanny Price	Lady Bertram took it differently .
Fanny Price	She had been a beauty , and a prosperous beauty , all her life ; and beauty and wealth were all that excited her respect .
Fanny Price	To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of fortune , raised her , therefore , very much in her opinion .
Fanny Price	By convincing her that Fanny _ was _ very pretty , which she had been doubting about before , and that she would be advantageously married
Fanny Price	, it made her feel a sort of credit in calling her niece .
Fanny Price	“ Well , Fanny , ” said she , as soon as they were alone together afterwards , and she really had known something like impatience to be alone with her , and her countenance , as she spoke , had extraordinary animation ; “ Well , Fanny , I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning .
Fanny Price	I must just speak of it _ once _ , I told Sir Thomas I must _ once _ , and then I shall have done .
Fanny Price	I give you joy , my dear niece . ”
Fanny Price	And looking at her complacently , she added , “ Humph , we certainly are a handsome family ! ”
Fanny Price	Fanny coloured , and doubted at first what to say ; when , hoping to assail her on her vulnerable side , she presently answered — “ My dear aunt , _ you _ can not wish me to do differently from what I have done , I am sure .
Fanny Price	_ You _ can not wish me to marry ; for you would miss me , should not you ?
Fanny Price	Yes , I am sure you would miss me too much for that . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , my dear , I should not think of missing you , when such an offer as this comes in your way .
Fanny Price	I could do very well without you , if you were married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford .
Fanny Price	And you must be aware , Fanny , that it is every young woman ’s duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this .
Fanny Price	This was almost the only rule of conduct , the only piece of advice , which Fanny had ever received from her aunt in the course of eight years and a half .
Fanny Price	It silenced her .
Fanny Price	She felt how unprofitable contention would be .
Fanny Price	If her aunt ’s feelings were against her , nothing could be hoped from attacking her understanding .
Fanny Price	Lady Bertram was quite talkative .
Fanny Price	“ I will tell you what , Fanny , ” said she , “ I am sure he fell in love with you at the ball ; I am sure the mischief was done that evening .
Fanny Price	You did look remarkably well .
Fanny Price	And you know you had Chapman to help you to dress .
Fanny Price	I am very glad I sent Chapman to you .
Fanny Price	I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that evening . ”
Fanny Price	And still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts , she soon afterwards added , “ And I will tell you what , Fanny , which is more than I did for Maria : the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy . ”
Fanny Price	_ You _ are not to be judged by the same rule .
Fanny Price	You do not owe me the duty of a child .
Fanny Price	But , Fanny ,
Fanny Price	if your heart can acquit you of _ ingratitude _ — ” He ceased .
Fanny Price	Fanny was by this time crying so bitterly that , angry as he was , he would not press that article farther .
Fanny Price	Her heart was almost broke by such a picture of what she appeared to him ; by such accusations , so heavy , so multiplied , so rising in dreadful gradation !
Fanny Price	He thought her all this .
Fanny Price	She had deceived his expectations ; she had lost his good opinion .
Fanny Price	What was to become of her ?
Fanny Price	“ I am very sorry , ” said she inarticulately , through her tears , “ I am very sorry indeed . ”
Fanny Price	yes , I hope you are sorry ; and you will probably have reason to be long sorry for this day ’s transactions . ”
Fanny Price	“ If it were possible for me to do otherwise ” said she , with another strong effort ; “ but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him happy , and that I should be miserable myself . ” Another burst of tears ; but in spite of that burst , and in spite of that great black word _ miserable _ , which served to introduce it , Sir Thomas began to think a little relenting , a little change of inclination , might have something to do with it ; and to augur favourably from the personal entreaty of the young man himself .
Fanny Price	He knew her to be very timid , and exceedingly nervous ; and thought it not improbable that her mind might be in such a state as a little time , a little pressing , a little patience , and a little impatience , a judicious mixture of all on the lover ’s side , might work their usual effect on .
Fanny Price	If the gentleman would but persevere , if he had but love enough to persevere , Sir Thomas began to have hopes ; and these reflections having passed across his mind and cheered it , “ Well , ” said he , in a tone of becoming gravity , but of less anger , “ well , child , dry up your tears .
Fanny Price	You must now come downstairs with me .
Fanny Price	You must give him your own answer : we can not expect him to be satisfied with less ; and you only can explain to him
Fanny Price	the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments , which , unfortunately for himself , he certainly has imbibed
Fanny Price	But Fanny shewed such reluctance , such misery , at the idea of going down to him , that Sir Thomas , after a little consideration , judged it better to indulge her .
Fanny Price	His hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered a small depression in consequence ; but when he looked at his niece , and saw the state of feature and complexion which her crying had brought her into , he thought there might be as much lost as gained by an immediate interview .
Fanny Price	With a few words , therefore , of no particular meaning , he walked off by himself , leaving his poor niece to sit and cry over what had passed , with very wretched feelings .
Fanny Price	Her mind was all disorder .
Fanny Price	But her uncle ’s anger gave her the severest pain of all .
Fanny Price	She was miserable for ever .
Fanny Price	She had no one to take her part , to counsel , or speak for her .
Fanny Price	Her only friend was absent .
Fanny Price	He might have softened his father ; but all , perhaps all , would think her selfish and ungrateful .
Fanny Price	She might have to endure the reproach again and again ; she might hear it , or see it , or know it to exist for ever in every connexion about her .
Fanny Price	She could not but feel some resentment against Mr. Crawford ; yet ,
Fanny Price	if he really loved her , and were unhappy too !
Fanny Price	In about a quarter of an hour her uncle returned ; she was almost ready to faint at the sight of him .
Fanny Price	He spoke calmly , however , without austerity , without reproach , and she revived a little .
Fanny Price	I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling , by an account of what he has felt .
Fanny Price	Upon my representation of what you were suffering , he immediately , and with the greatest delicacy , ceased to urge to see you for the present . ”
Fanny Price	Here Fanny , who had looked up , looked down again .
Fanny Price	“ Of course , ” continued her uncle , “ it can not be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone , be it only for five minutes ; a request too natural , a claim too just to be denied .
Fanny Price	But there is no time fixed ; perhaps to - morrow , or whenever your spirits are composed enough .
Fanny Price	For the present you have only to tranquillise yourself .
Fanny Price	Check these tears ; they do but exhaust you .
Fanny Price	If , as I am willing to suppose , you wish to shew me any observance , you will not give way to these emotions , but endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind .
Fanny Price	I advise you to go out : the air will do you good ; go out for an hour on the gravel ; you will have the shrubbery to yourself , and will be the better for air and exercise .
Fanny Price	And , Fanny ” ( turning back again for a moment ) , “ I shall make no mention below of what has passed ; I shall not even tell your aunt Bertram .
Fanny Price	There is no occasion for spreading the disappointment ; say nothing about it yourself .
Fanny Price	” This was an order to be most joyfully obeyed ; this was an act of kindness which Fanny felt at her heart .
Fanny Price	To be spared from her aunt Norris ’s interminable reproaches !
Fanny Price	he left her in a glow of gratitude .
Fanny Price	She walked out directly , as her uncle recommended , and followed his advice throughout , as far as she could ; did check her tears ; did earnestly try to compose her spirits and strengthen her mind .
Fanny Price	She wished to prove to him that she did desire his comfort , and sought to regain his favour ; and he had given her another strong motive for exertion , in keeping the whole affair from the knowledge of her aunts .
Fanny Price	Not to excite suspicion by her look or manner was now an object worth attaining ; and she felt equal to almost anything that might save her from her aunt Norris .
Fanny Price	She was struck , quite struck , when , on returning from her walk and going into the East room again , the first thing which caught her eye was a fire lighted and burning .
Fanny Price	it seemed too much ; just at that time to be giving her such an indulgence was exciting even painful gratitude .
Fanny Price	She wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think of such a trifle again ; but she soon found , from the voluntary information of the housemaid , who came in to attend it , that so it was to be every day .
Fanny Price	“ I must be a brute , indeed , if I can be really ungrateful ! ” said she , in soliloquy .
Fanny Price	“ Heaven defend me from being ungrateful ! ”
Fanny Price	She saw nothing more of her uncle , nor of her aunt Norris , till they met at dinner .
Fanny Price	Her uncle ’s behaviour to her was then as nearly as possible what it had been before ; she was sure he did not mean there should be any change , and that it was only her own conscience that could fancy any ; but her aunt was soon quarrelling with her ; and
Fanny Price	when she found how much and how unpleasantly her having only walked out without her aunt ’s knowledge could be dwelt on , she felt all the reason she had to bless the kindness which saved her from the same spirit of reproach , exerted on a more momentous subject . “ If I had known you were going out , I should have got you just to go as far as my house with some orders for Nanny , ” said she , “ which I have since , to my very great inconvenience , been obliged to go and carry myself .
Fanny Price	I could very ill spare the time , and you might have saved me the trouble , if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were going out .
Fanny Price	It would have made no difference to you , I suppose , whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house .
Fanny Price	“ I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place , ” said Sir Thomas .
Fanny Price	“ Oh ! ” said Mrs. Norris , with a moment ’s check , “ that was very kind of you , Sir Thomas ; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house .
Fanny Price	Fanny would have had quite as good a walk there , I assure you , with the advantage of being of some use , and obliging her aunt : it is all her fault .
Fanny Price	If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is
Fanny Price	a something about Fanny
Fanny Price	, I have often observed it before — she likes to go her own way to work ; she does not like to be dictated to ; she takes her own independent walk whenever she can ; she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy , and independence , and nonsense , about her , which I would advise her to get the better of . ”
Fanny Price	As a general reflection on Fanny , Sir Thomas thought nothing could be more unjust , though he had been so lately expressing the same sentiments himself , and he tried to turn the conversation : tried repeatedly before he could succeed ; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment enough to perceive , either now , or at any other time , to what degree he thought well of his niece , or how very far he was from wishing to have his own children ’s merits set off by the depreciation of hers .
Fanny Price	She was talking _ at _ Fanny , and resenting this private walk half through the dinner .
Fanny Price	It was over , however , at last ; and the evening set in with more composure to Fanny , and more cheerfulness of spirits than she could have hoped for after so stormy a morning ; but she trusted , in the first place , that she had done right : that her judgment had not misled her . For the purity of her intentions she could answer ; and she was willing to hope , secondly , that her uncle ’s displeasure was abating , and would abate farther as he considered the matter with more impartiality , and felt , as a good man must feel , how wretched , and how unpardonable , how hopeless , and how wicked it was to marry without affection . When the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past , she could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally concluded , and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield , that everything would soon be as if no such subject had existed .
Fanny Price	She would not , could not believe , that Mr. Crawford ’s affection for her could distress him long ; his mind was not of that sort .
Fanny Price	In London he would soon learn to wonder at his infatuation , and be thankful for the right reason in her which had saved him from its evil consequences . While Fanny ’s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes , her uncle was , soon after tea , called out of the room ; an occurrence too common to strike her , and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared ten minutes afterwards , and advancing decidedly towards herself , said , “ Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you , ma’am , in his own room . ”
Fanny Price	Then it occurred to her what might be going on ; a suspicion rushed over her mind which drove the colour from her cheeks ; but instantly rising , she was preparing to obey , when Mrs. Norris called out , “ Stay , stay , Fanny !
Fanny Price	what are you about ?
Fanny Price	where are you going ?
Fanny Price	Depend upon it , it is not you who are wanted ; depend upon it , it is me ” ( looking at the butler ) ; “ but you are so very eager to put yourself forward .
Fanny Price	It is me , Baddeley , you mean ; I am coming this moment .
Fanny Price	You mean me , Baddeley , I am sure ; Sir Thomas wants me , not Miss Price . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , ma’am , it is Miss Price ; I am certain of its being Miss Price . ”
Fanny Price	And there was a half - smile with the words , which meant , “ I do not think you would answer the purpose at all . ”
Fanny Price	Mrs. Norris , much discontented , was obliged to compose herself to work again ; and Fanny , walking off in agitating consciousness , found herself , as she anticipated , in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford .
Fanny Price	XLI A week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town , and Fanny had heard nothing of him .
Fanny Price	were three different conclusions to be drawn from his silence , between which her mind was in fluctuation ;
Fanny Price	One morning , about this time , Fanny having now been nearly four weeks from Mansfield , a point which she never failed to think over and calculate every day , as she and Susan were preparing to remove , as usual , upstairs , they were stopped by the knock of a visitor , whom they felt they could not avoid , from Rebecca ’s alertness in going to the door , a duty which always interested her beyond any other .
Fanny Price	It was a gentleman ’s voice ; it was a voice that Fanny was just turning pale about , when Mr. Crawford walked into the room .
Fanny Price	Good sense , like hers , will always act when really called upon ; and she found that she had been able to name him to her mother , and recall her remembrance of the name , as that of “ William ’s friend , ” though she could not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable at such a moment .
Fanny Price	Having introduced him , however , and being all reseated , the terrors that occurred of what this visit might lead to were overpowering , and she fancied herself on the point of fainting away .
Fanny Price	While trying to keep herself alive , their visitor , who had at first approached her with as animated a countenance as ever , was wisely and kindly keeping his eyes away , and giving her time to recover , while he devoted himself entirely to her mother , addressing her , and attending to her with the utmost politeness and propriety , at the same time with a degree of friendliness , of interest at least , which was making his manner perfect . Mrs. Price ’s manners were also at their best .
Fanny Price	Warmed by the sight of such a friend to her son , and regulated by the wish of appearing to advantage before him , she was overflowing with gratitude — artless , maternal gratitude — which could not be unpleasing .
Fanny Price	Mr. Price was out , which she regretted very much .
Fanny Price	Fanny was just recovered enough to feel that _ she _ could not regret it ; for to her many other sources of uneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which he found her .
Fanny Price	She might scold herself for the weakness , but there was no scolding it away .
Fanny Price	She was ashamed , and she would have been yet more ashamed of her father than of all the rest .
Fanny Price	They talked of William , a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire ; and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart could wish .
Fanny Price	She felt that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life ; and was only astonished to find that , so great and so agreeable as he was , he should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to the port - admiral , nor the commissioner , nor yet with the intention of going over to the island , nor of seeing the dockyard .
Fanny Price	Nothing of all that she had been used to think of as the proof of importance , or the employment of wealth , had brought him to Portsmouth .
Fanny Price	By the time he had given all this information , it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to ; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye , and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London ; that she had sent her best and kindest love , but had had no time for writing ; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour , having spent scarcely twenty - four hours in London , after his return from Norfolk , before he set off again ; that her cousin Edmund was in town , had been in town , he understood , a few days ; that he had not seen him himself , but that he was well , had left them all well at Mansfield , and was to dine , as yesterday , with the Frasers .
Fanny Price	Fanny listened collectedly , even to the last - mentioned circumstance ; nay , it seemed a relief to her worn mind to be at any certainty ; and the words , “ then by this time it is all settled , ” passed internally , without more evidence of emotion than a faint blush .
Fanny Price	After talking a little more about Mansfield , a subject in which her interest was most apparent , Crawford began to hint at the expediency of an early walk .
Fanny Price	And the consequence was , that Fanny , strange as it was — strange , awkward , and distressing — found herself and Susan , within ten minutes , walking towards the High Street with Mr. Crawford .
Fanny Price	It was soon pain upon pain , confusion upon confusion ; for they were hardly in the High Street before they met her father , whose appearance was not the better from its being Saturday .
Fanny Price	He stopt ; and , ungentlemanlike as he looked , Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr. Crawford .
Fanny Price	She could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr. Crawford must be struck .
Fanny Price	He must soon give her up , and cease to have the smallest inclination for the match ; and yet , though she had been so much wanting his affection to be cured , this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as the complaint ; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever , agreeable man , than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations .
Fanny Price	Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his future father - in - law with any idea of taking him for a model in dress ; but ( as Fanny instantly , and to her great relief , discerned ) her father was a very different man , a very different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly respected stranger , from what he was in his own family at home .
Fanny Price	Such was his instinctive compliment to the good manners of Mr. Crawford ; and , be the consequence what it might , Fanny ’s immediate feelings were infinitely soothed .
Fanny Price	The conclusion of the two gentlemen ’s civilities was an offer of Mr. Price ’s to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard , which Mr. Crawford , desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such , though he had seen the dockyard again and again , and hoping to be so much the longer with Fanny , was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of , if the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue ; and as it was somehow or other ascertained , or inferred , or at least acted upon , that they were not at all afraid , to the dockyard they were all to go ; and but for Mr. Crawford , Mr. Price would have turned thither directly , without the smallest consideration for his daughters ’ errands in the High Street .
Fanny Price	He took care , however , that they should be allowed to go to the shops they came out expressly to visit ; and it did not delay them long , for Fanny could so little bear to excite impatience , or be waited for , that before the gentlemen , as they stood at the door , could do more than begin upon the last naval regulations , or settle the number of three - deckers now in commission , their companions were ready to proceed
Fanny Price	Once fairly in the dockyard , he began to reckon upon some happy intercourse with Fanny , as they were very soon joined by a brother lounger of Mr. Price ’s , who was come to take his daily survey of how things went on , and who must prove a far more worthy companion than himself ; and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied going about together , and discussing matters of equal and never - failing interest , while the young people sat down upon some timbers in the yard , or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all went to look at .
Fanny Price	Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest .
Fanny Price	Crawford could not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down ; but he could have wished her sister away .
Fanny Price	He must content himself with being only generally agreeable , and letting Susan have her share of entertainment , with the indulgence , now and then , of a look or hint for the better - informed and conscious Fanny .
Fanny Price	For Fanny , somewhat more was related than the accidental agreeableness of the parties he had been in .
Fanny Price	For her approbation , the particular reason of his going into Norfolk at all , at this unusual time of year , was given .
Fanny Price	This was aimed , and well aimed , at Fanny .
Fanny Price	Nothing could be more grateful to her ; and she was on the point of giving him an approving look , when it was all frightened off by his adding a something too pointed of his hoping soon to have an assistant , a friend , a guide in every plan of utility or charity for Everingham : a somebody that would make Everingham and all about it a dearer object than it had ever been yet .
Fanny Price	She turned away , and wished he would not say such things .
Fanny Price	She was willing to allow he might have more good qualities than she had been wo nt to suppose .
Fanny Price	She began to feel the possibility of his turning out well at last ; but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her , and ought not to think of her .
Fanny Price	He could not have chosen better ; that was a topic to bring back her attention and her looks almost instantly .
Fanny Price	It was a real indulgence to her to hear or to speak of Mansfield .
Fanny Price	Now so long divided from everybody who knew the place , she felt it quite the voice of a friend when he mentioned it , and led the way to her fond exclamations in praise of its beauties and comforts , and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed her to gratify her own heart in the warmest eulogium , in speaking of her uncle as all that was clever and good , and her aunt as having the sweetest of all sweet tempers .
Fanny Price	Fanny was doubly silenced here ; though when the moment was passed , could regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged comprehension of one half of his meaning , and encouraged him to say something more of his sister and Edmund .
Fanny Price	It was a subject which she must learn to speak of , and the weakness that shrunk from it would soon be quite unpardonable .
Fanny Price	, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute ’s privacy for telling Fanny that his only business in Portsmouth was to see her ; that he was come down for a couple of days on her account , and hers only , and because he could not endure a longer total separation . She was sorry , really sorry ; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said , she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him ; he was much more gentle , obliging , and attentive to other people ’s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield ; she had never seen him so agreeable — so _ near _ being agreeable ; his behaviour to her father could not offend , and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of Susan . He was decidedly improved .
Fanny Price	She wished the next day over , she wished he had come only for one day ; but it was not so very bad as she would have expected : the pleasure of talking of Mansfield was so very great !
Fanny Price	Before they parted , she had to thank him for another pleasure , and one of no trivial kind .
Fanny Price	Her father asked him to do them the honour of taking his mutton with them , and Fanny had time for only one thrill of horror , before he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement .
Fanny Price	He was engaged to dinner already both for that day and the next ; he had met with some acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied ; he should have the honour , however , of waiting on them again on the morrow , etc . , and so they parted — Fanny in a state of actual felicity from escaping so horrible an evil !
Fanny Price	Rebecca ’s cookery and Rebecca ’s waiting , and Betsey ’s eating at table without restraint , and pulling everything about as she chose , were what Fanny herself was not yet enough inured to for her often to make a tolerable meal .
Fanny Price	_ She _ was nice only from natural delicacy , but _ he _ had been brought up in a school of luxury and epicurism .
Fanny Price	III The first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr. Norris , which happened when Fanny was about fifteen , and necessarily introduced alterations and novelties .
Fanny Price	, removed first to the Park , and afterwards to a small house of Sir Thomas ’s in the village , and consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him ; and for her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy . The living was hereafter for Edmund ; and , had his uncle died a few years sooner , it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders .
Fanny Price	The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister - in - law to claim her share in their niece , the change in Mrs. Norris ’s situation , and the improvement in Fanny ’s age , seeming not merely to do away any former objection to their living together , but even to give it the most decided eligibility ; and as his own circumstances were rendered less fair than heretofore , by some recent losses on his West India estate , in addition to his eldest son ’s extravagance , it became not undesirable to himself to be relieved from the expense of her support , and the obligation of her future provision .
Fanny Price	In the fullness of his belief that such a thing must be , he mentioned its probability to his wife ; and the first time of the subject ’s occurring to her again happening to be when Fanny was present , she calmly observed to her , “ So , Fanny , you are going to leave us , and live with my sister .
Fanny Price	How shall you like it ? ”
Fanny Price	Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt ’s words , “ Going to leave you ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , my dear ; why should you be astonished ?
Fanny Price	You have been five years with us , and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died .
Fanny Price	But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same . ” The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected .
Fanny Price	She had never received kindness from her aunt Norris , and could not love her .
Fanny Price	“ I shall be very sorry to go away , ” said she , with a faltering voice .
Fanny Price	“ Yes , I dare say you will ; _ that ’s _ natural enough .
Fanny Price	I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world . ”
Fanny Price	“ I hope I am not ungrateful , aunt , ” said Fanny modestly .
Fanny Price	“ No , my dear ; I hope not .
Fanny Price	I have always found you a very good girl . ”
Fanny Price	“ And am I never to live here again ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Never , my dear ; but you are sure of a comfortable home .
Fanny Price	It can make very little difference to you , whether you are in one house or the other . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart ; she could not feel the difference to be so small , she could not think of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction .
Fanny Price	As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress .
Fanny Price	“ Cousin , ” said she , “ something is going to happen which I do not like at all ; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first , you will not be able to do it now .
Fanny Price	I am going to live entirely with my aunt Norris . ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes ; my aunt Bertram has just told me so .
Fanny Price	I am to leave Mansfield Park , and go to the White House , I suppose , as soon as she is removed there . ”
Fanny Price	“ Well , Fanny , and if the plan were not unpleasant to you , I should call it an excellent one . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh , cousin ! ” “ It has everything else in its favour .
Fanny Price	My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you .
Fanny Price	You will be what you ought to be to her .
Fanny Price	I hope it does not distress you very much , Fanny ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Indeed it does : I can not like it .
Fanny Price	I love this house and everything in it : I shall love nothing there .
Fanny Price	You know how uncomfortable I feel with her . ”
Fanny Price	“ I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child ; but it was the same with us all , or nearly so .
Fanny Price	But you are now of an age to be treated better ; I think she is behaving better already ; and when you are her only companion , you _ must _ be important to her .
Fanny Price	“ I can never be important to any one . ” “ What is to prevent you ?
Fanny Price	My situation , my foolishness and awkwardness . ”
Fanny Price	“ As to your foolishness and awkwardness , my dear Fanny , believe me , you never have a shadow of either , but in using the words so improperly .
Fanny Price	There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known .
Fanny Price	You have good sense , and a sweet temper , and I am sure you have a grateful heart , that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it .
Fanny Price	“ You are too kind , ” said Fanny , colouring at such praise ; “ how shall I ever thank you as I ought , for thinking so well of me .
Fanny Price	cousin , if I am to go away , I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life . ” “ Why , indeed , Fanny , I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House .
Fanny Price	You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park ; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever .
Fanny Price	The only difference will be that , living with your aunt , you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be .
Fanny Price	_ Here _ there are too many whom you can hide behind ; but with _ her _ you will be forced to speak for yourself . ” “ Oh !
Fanny Price	Mrs. Norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now .
Fanny Price	She is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about , and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny sighed , and said , “ I can not see things as you do ; but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself ,
Fanny Price	and I am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be .
Fanny Price	If I could suppose my aunt really to care for me , it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody .
Fanny Price	_ Here _ , I know , I am of none , and yet I love the place so well . ”
Fanny Price	“ The place , Fanny , is what you will not quit , though you quit the house .
Fanny Price	You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever .
Fanny Price	Even _ your _ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change .
Fanny Price	You will have the same walks to frequent , the same library to choose from , the same people to look at , the same horse to ride . ”
Fanny Price	cousin , when I remember how much I used to dread riding , what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good ( oh ! how I have trembled at my uncle ’s opening his lips if horses were talked of ) , and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears , and convince me that I should like it after a little while , and feel how right you proved to be , I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well .
Fanny Price	“ And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health , and as much for your ultimate happiness too .
Fanny Price	So ended their discourse , which , for any very appropriate service it could render Fanny , might as well have been spared , for Mrs. Norris had not the smallest intention of taking her .
Fanny Price	Not all her precautions , however , could save her from being suspected of something better ; or , perhaps , her very display of the importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose it really intended for Fanny .
Fanny Price	Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris — “ I think , sister , we need not keep Miss Lee any longer , when Fanny goes to live with you . ”
Fanny Price	“ Is she not to live with you ?
Fanny Price	Fanny live with me !
Fanny Price	what could I do with Fanny ?
Fanny Price	He could not say he _ wished _ me to take Fanny .
Fanny Price	We both thought it would be a comfort to you .
Fanny Price	But if you do not like it , there is no more to be said .
Fanny Price	She is no encumbrance here . ”
Fanny Price	“ Dear sister , if you consider my unhappy state , how can she be any comfort to me ?
Fanny Price	Here am I , a poor desolate widow , deprived of the best of husbands , my health gone in attending and nursing him , my spirits still worse , all my peace in this world destroyed , with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman , and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed — what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny ?
Fanny Price	If I could wish it for my own sake , I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl .
Fanny Price	She is in good hands , and sure of doing well .
Fanny Price	” “ Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone ? ” “ Lady Bertram , I do not complain .
Fanny Price	“ Well , Lady Bertram , ” said Mrs. Norris , moving to go , “ I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ;
Fanny Price	besides that , I really should not have a bed to give her , for I must keep a spare room for a friend . ”
Fanny Price	He could not but wonder at her refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt ; but , as she took early care to make him , as well as Lady Bertram , understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family , he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which , at the same time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them , would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself . Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal ; and her spontaneous , untaught felicity on the discovery , conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her .
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s relief , and her consciousness of it , were quite equal to her cousins ’ ; but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings were ungrateful , and she really grieved because she could not grieve .
Fanny Price	Sir Thomas , who had done so much for her and her brothers , and who was gone perhaps never to return ! that she should see him go without a tear !
Fanny Price	He had said to her , moreover , on the very last morning , that he hoped she might see William again in the course of the ensuing winter , and had charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to be in England . “ This was so thoughtful and kind ! ” and would he only have smiled upon her , and called her “ my dear Fanny , ”
Fanny Price	But he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification , by adding , “ If William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . ”
Fanny Price	She cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle was gone ; and her cousins , on seeing her with red eyes , set her down as a hypocrite .
Fanny Price	Lady Bertram , who was a woman of very tranquil feelings , and a temper remarkably easy and indolent , would have contented herself with merely giving up her sister , and thinking no more of the matter ; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity , which could not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to Fanny , to point out the folly of her conduct , and threaten her with all its possible ill consequences .
Fanny Price	and an answer , which comprehended each sister in its bitterness , and bestowed such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir Thomas as Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herself , put an end to all intercourse between them for a considerable period . Their homes were so distant , and the circles in which they moved so distinct , as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each other ’s existence during the eleven following years , or , at least , to make it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have it in her power to tell them , as she now and then did , in an angry voice , that Fanny had got another child .
Fanny Price	XLIII It was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back , to London , on the morrow , for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price ’s ; and two days afterwards , it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letter from his sister , opened and read by her , on another account , with the most anxious curiosity :
Fanny Price	— “ I have to inform you , my dearest Fanny , that Henry has been down to Portsmouth to see you ; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday , and one still more to be dwelt on the next day , on the ramparts ; when the balmy air , the sparkling sea , and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony , and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect .
Fanny Price	He makes me write , but I do not know what else is to be communicated , except this said visit to Portsmouth , and these two said walks , and his introduction to your family , especially to a fair sister of yours , a fine girl of fifteen , who was of the party on the ramparts , taking her first lesson , I presume , in love .
Fanny Price	My dear , dear Fanny , if I had you here , how I would talk to you !
Fanny Price	You should listen to me till you were tired , and advise me till you were still tired more ; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper , so I will abstain altogether , and leave you to guess what you like .
Fanny Price	I have no news for you .
Fanny Price	You have politics , of course ; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people and parties that fill up my time .
Fanny Price	I ought to have sent you an account of your cousin ’s first party , but I was lazy , and now it is too long
Fanny Price	He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund .
Fanny Price	“ I had almost forgot ( it was Edmund ’s fault : he gets into my head more than does me good ) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and myself — I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire .
Fanny Price	My dear little creature , do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks .
Fanny Price	I am at your service and Henry ’s , at an hour ’s notice .
Fanny Price	I should like the scheme , and we would make a little circuit , and shew you Everingham in our way , and perhaps you would not mind passing through London , and seeing the inside of St. George ’s , Hanover Square .
Fanny Price	Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such a time : I should not like to be tempted .
Fanny Price	Henry , I find , has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon some business that _ you _ approve ; but this can not possibly be permitted before the middle of next week ; that is , he can not anyhow be spared till after the 14th , for _ we _ have a party that evening .
Fanny Price	The value of a man like Henry , on such an occasion , is what you can have no conception of ; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable .
Fanny Price	This was Fanny ’s most frequent expectation .
Fanny Price	A house in town — that , she thought , must be impossible .
Fanny Price	The prospect for her cousin grew worse and worse .
Fanny Price	Fanny was ashamed of her .
Fanny Price	Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr. Crawford and herself , touched her , in comparison , slightly .
Fanny Price	Whether Mr. Crawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no concern of hers , though , everything considered , she thought he _ would _ go without delay .
Fanny Price	That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a meeting between him and Mrs. Rushworth , was all in her worst line of conduct , and grossly unkind and ill - judged ; but she hoped _ he _ would not be actuated by any such degrading curiosity .
Fanny Price	She was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receiving this than she had been before ; and for a few days was so unsettled by it altogether , by what had come , and what might come , that her usual readings and conversation with Susan were much suspended . She could not
Fanny Price	command her attention as she wished .
Fanny Price	If Mr. Crawford remembered her message to her cousin , she thought it very likely , most likely , that he would write to her at all events ; it would be most consistent with his usual kindness ; and till she got rid of this idea , till it gradually wore off , by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days more , she was in a most restless , anxious state .
Fanny Price	Suspense must be submitted to , and must not be allowed to wear her out , and make her useless .
Fanny Price	Time did something , her own exertions something more , and she resumed her attentions to Susan , and again awakened the same interest in them .
Fanny Price	Susan was growing very fond of her , and though without any of the early delight in books which had been so strong in Fanny , with a disposition much less inclined to sedentary pursuits , or to information for information ’s sake , she had so strong a desire of not _ appearing _ ignorant , as , with a good clear understanding , made her a most attentive , profitable , thankful pupil .
Fanny Price	Fanny was her oracle .
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s explanations and remarks were a most important addition to every essay , or every chapter of history .
Fanny Price	What Fanny told her of former times dwelt more on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith ; and she paid her sister the compliment of preferring her style to that of any printed author .
Fanny Price	Susan , who had an innate taste for the genteel and well - appointed , was eager to hear , and Fanny could not but indulge herself in dwelling on so beloved a theme .
Fanny Price	She hoped it was not wrong ; though , after a time , Susan ’s very great admiration of everything said or done in her uncle ’s house , and earnest longing to go into Northamptonshire , seemed almost to blame her for exciting feelings which could not be gratified . Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her elder sister ; and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this , she began to feel that when her own release from Portsmouth came , her happiness would have a material drawback in leaving Susan behind .
Fanny Price	That a girl so capable of being made everything good should be left in such hands , distressed her more and more .
Fanny Price	Were _ she _ likely to have a home to invite her to , what a blessing it would be !
Fanny Price	And had it been possible for her to return Mr. Crawford ’s regard , the probability of his being very far from objecting to such a measure would have been the greatest increase of all her own comforts .
Fanny Price	She thought he was really good - tempered , and could fancy his entering into a plan of that sort most pleasantly .
Fanny Price	You know very well what is right . ” “ Yes .
Fanny Price	When you give me your opinion , I always know what is right .
Fanny Price	Your judgment is my rule of right . ”
Fanny Price	Good - bye ; I wish you a pleasant journey to - morrow .
Fanny Price	“ Is there nothing I can do for you in town ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Nothing ; I am much obliged to you . ”
Fanny Price	“ Have you no message for anybody ? ” “ My love to your sister , if you please ; and when you see my cousin , my cousin Edmund , I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him . ” “ Certainly ; and if he is lazy or negligent , I will write his excuses myself . ” He could say no more , for Fanny would be no longer detained .
Fanny Price	He pressed her hand , looked at her , and was gone .
Fanny Price	He _ went to while away the next three hours as he could , with his other acquaintance , till the best dinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment , and _ she _ turned in to her more simple one immediately .
Fanny Price	Their general fare bore a very different character ; and could he have suspected how many privations , besides that of exercise , she endured in her father ’s house , he would have wondered that her looks were not much more affected than he found them .
Fanny Price	She was so little equal to Rebecca ’s puddings and Rebecca ’s hashes , brought to table , as they all were , with such accompaniments of half - cleaned plates , and not half - cleaned knives and forks , that she was very often constrained to defer her heartiest meal till she could send her brothers in the evening for biscuits and buns .
Fanny Price	After being nursed up at Mansfield , it was too late in the day to be hardened at Portsmouth ; and though Sir Thomas , had he known all , might have thought his niece in the most promising way of being starved , both mind and body , into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford ’s good company and good fortune , he would probably have feared to push his experiment farther , lest she might die under the cure . Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day .
Fanny Price	Though tolerably secure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again , she could not help being low .
Fanny Price	It was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend ; and though , in one light , glad to have him gone , it seemed as if she was now deserted by everybody ; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield ; and she could not think of his returning to town , and being frequently with Mary and Edmund , without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate herself for having them .
Fanny Price	Her dejection had no abatement from anything passing around her ;
Fanny Price	a friend or two of her father ’s , as always happened if he was not with them , spent the long , long evening there ; and from six o’clock till half - past nine , there was little intermission of noise or grog .
Fanny Price	She was very low .
Fanny Price	The wonderful improvement which she still fancied in Mr. Crawford was the nearest to administering comfort of anything within the current of her thoughts .
Fanny Price	Not considering in how different a circle she had been just seeing him , nor how much might be owing to contrast , she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and regardful of others than formerly .
Fanny Price	So anxious for her health and comfort , so very feeling as he now expressed himself , and really seemed , might not it be fairly supposed that he would not much longer persevere in a suit so distressing to her ?
Fanny Price	XXXV Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse whether her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned between them or not ; and that if she did not lead the way , it should never be touched on by him ; but after a day or two of mutual reserve , he was induced by his father to change his mind , and try what his influence might do for his friend .
Fanny Price	Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business ; he wanted to know Fanny ’s feelings .
Fanny Price	She had been used to consult him in every difficulty , and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her confidence now ; he hoped to be of service to her , he thought he must be of service to her ; whom else had she to open her heart to ?
Fanny Price	If she did not need counsel , she must need the comfort of communication .
Fanny Price	Fanny estranged from him , silent and reserved , was an unnatural state of things ; a state which he must break through , and which he could easily learn to think she was wanting him to break through .
Fanny Price	“ I will speak to her , sir : I will take the first opportunity of speaking to her alone , ” was the result of such thoughts as these ; and
Fanny Price	upon Sir Thomas ’s information of her being at that very time walking alone in the shrubbery , he instantly joined her . “ I am come to walk with you , Fanny , ” said he .
Fanny Price	“ Shall I ? ”
Fanny Price	Drawing her arm within his .
Fanny Price	She assented to it all rather by look than word .
Fanny Price	Her spirits were low .
Fanny Price	“ But , Fanny , ” he presently added , “ in order to have a comfortable walk , something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together .
Fanny Price	You must talk to me .
Fanny Price	I know you have something on your mind .
Fanny Price	I know what you are thinking of .
Fanny Price	You can not suppose me uninformed .
Fanny Price	Am I to hear of it from everybody but Fanny herself ?
Fanny Price	Fanny , at once agitated and dejected , replied , “ If you hear of it from everybody , cousin , there can be nothing for me to tell . ” “ Not of facts , perhaps ; but of feelings , Fanny . No one but you can tell me them .
Fanny Price	I do not mean to press you , however .
Fanny Price	If it is not what you wish yourself , I have done .
Fanny Price	“ I am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what I feel . ”
Fanny Price	“ Do you suppose that we think differently ?
Fanny Price	I dare say that , on a comparison of our opinions , they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be : to the point — I consider Crawford ’s proposals as most advantageous and desirable , if you could return his affection .
Fanny Price	I consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it ; but that , as you can not , you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him .
Fanny Price	But I thought you blamed me .
Fanny Price	I thought you were against me .
Fanny Price	“ This comfort you might have had sooner , Fanny , had you sought it .
Fanny Price	But how could you possibly suppose me against you ?
Fanny Price	How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love ?
Fanny Price	Were I even careless in general on such matters , how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake ? ” “ My uncle thought me wrong , and I knew he had been talking to you . ” “ As far as you have gone , Fanny , I think you perfectly right .
Fanny Price	I may be sorry , I may be surprised — though hardly _ that _ , for you had not had time to attach yourself — but I think you perfectly right .
Fanny Price	You did not love him ; nothing could have justified your accepting him . ” Fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days . “ So far your conduct has been faultless , and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise .
Fanny Price	But ” ( with an affectionate smile ) “ let him succeed at last , Fanny , let him succeed at last .
Fanny Price	You have proved yourself upright and disinterested , prove yourself grateful and tender - hearted ; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always believed you born for . ”
Fanny Price	he never will succeed with me . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny!—so very determined and positive !
Fanny Price	This is not like yourself , your rational self . ”
Fanny Price	I am aware , more aware than Crawford can be , that the man who means to make you love him ( you having due notice of his intentions ) must have very uphill work , for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array ; and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate , which so many years ’ growth have confirmed , and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation .
Fanny Price	I know that the apprehension of being forced to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you against him .
Fanny Price	I wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for .
Fanny Price	I wish he had known you as well as I do , Fanny .
Fanny Price	Between us , I think we should have won you .
Fanny Price	I must hope , however , that time , proving him ( as I firmly believe it will ) to deserve you by his steady affection , will give him his reward .
Fanny Price	I can not suppose that you have not the _ wish _ to love him — the natural wish of gratitude .
Fanny Price	You must have some feeling of that sort .
Fanny Price	You must be sorry for your own indifference .
Fanny Price	” “ We are so totally unlike , ” said Fanny , avoiding a direct answer , “ we are so very , very different in all our inclinations and ways , that I consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together , even if I _ could _ like him .
Fanny Price	“ You are mistaken , Fanny .
Fanny Price	You have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings ; and , Fanny , who that heard him read , and saw you listen to Shakespeare the other night , will think you unfitted as companions ?
Fanny Price	You forget yourself : there is a decided difference in your tempers , I allow .
Fanny Price	He is lively , you are serious ; but so much the better : his spirits will support yours .
Fanny Price	It is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are .
Fanny Price	Your being so far unlike , Fanny , does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together : do not imagine it .
Fanny Price	” Full well could Fanny guess where his thoughts were now :
Fanny Price	After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes , Fanny , feeling it due to herself , returned to Mr. Crawford , and said , “ It is not merely in _ temper _ that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself ; though , in _ that _ respect , I think the difference between us too great , infinitely too great : his spirits often oppress me ; but there is something in him which I object to still more .
Fanny Price	I must say , cousin , that I can not approve his character .
Fanny Price	I have not thought well of him from the time of the play .
Fanny Price	I then saw him behaving , as it appeared to me , so very improperly and unfeelingly — I may speak of it now because it is all over — so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth , not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him , and paying attentions to my cousin Maria , which — in short , at the time of the play , I received an impression which will never be got over .
Fanny Price	“ My dear Fanny , ” replied Edmund , scarcely hearing her to the end , “ let us not , any of us , be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly .
Fanny Price	” “ As a bystander , ” said Fanny , “ perhaps I saw more than you did ; and I do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous . ”
Fanny Price	I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of it ; but , if she could undertake the part , we must not be surprised at the rest .
Fanny Price	“ Before the play , I am much mistaken if _ Julia _ did not think he was paying her attentions . ”
Fanny Price	I have heard before from some one of his being in love with Julia ; but I could never see anything of it .
Fanny Price	And , Fanny , though I hope I do justice to my sisters ’ good qualities , I think it very possible that they might , one or both , be more desirous of being admired by Crawford , and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent .
Fanny Price	I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society ; and with such encouragement , a man like Crawford , lively , and it may be , a little unthinking , might be led on to — there could be nothing very striking , because it is clear that he had no pretensions : his heart was reserved for you .
Fanny Price	And I must say , that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion .
Fanny Price	” “ I am persuaded that he does not think , as he ought , on serious subjects . ” “ Say , rather , that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects , which I believe to be a good deal the case .
Fanny Price	You will supply the rest ; and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature — to a woman who , firm as a rock in her own principles , has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them .
Fanny Price	He will make you happy , Fanny ; I know he will make you happy ; but you will make him everything .
Fanny Price	” “ I would not engage in such a charge , ” cried Fanny , in a shrinking accent ; “ in such an office of high responsibility ! ”
Fanny Price	“ As usual , believing yourself unequal to anything ! fancying everything too much for you !
Fanny Price	Well , though I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings , you will be persuaded into them , I trust .
Fanny Price	I confess myself sincerely anxious that you may .
Fanny Price	Next to your happiness , Fanny , his has the first claim on me .
Fanny Price	You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford .
Fanny Price	Fanny was too well aware of it to have anything to say ; and they walked on together some fifty yards in mutual silence and abstraction .
Fanny Price	I knew she was very fond of you ; but yet I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved , and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune .
Fanny Price	She spoke of you , Fanny , just as she ought .
Fanny Price	She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity . ” “ Was Mrs. Grant in the room , then ? ” “ Yes , when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in .
Fanny Price	“ It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford . ”
Fanny Price	You will see her , however , before she goes .
Fanny Price	She is very angry with you , Fanny ; you must be prepared for that .
Fanny Price	She calls herself very angry , but you can imagine her anger .
Fanny Price	She is hurt , as you would be for William ; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart .
Fanny Price	“ I knew she would be very angry with me . ” “ My dearest Fanny , ” cried Edmund , pressing her arm closer to him , “ do not let the idea of her anger distress you .
Fanny Price	I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise ; I
Fanny Price	wish you could have seen her countenance , when she said that you _ should _ be Henry ’s wife .
Fanny Price	And I observed that she always spoke of you as ‘ Fanny , ’ which she was never used to do ; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality .
Fanny Price	The surprise of your refusal , Fanny , seems to have been unbounded .
Fanny Price	That you could refuse such a man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand .
Fanny Price	I said what I could for you ; but in good truth , as they stated the case — you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct ; nothing else will satisfy them .
Fanny Price	But this is teasing you .
Fanny Price	“ I _ should _ have thought , ” said Fanny , after a pause of recollection and exertion , “ that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man ’s not being approved , not being loved by some one of her sex at least , let him be ever so generally agreeable .
Fanny Price	Let him have all the perfections in the world , I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself .
Fanny Price	But , even supposing it is so , allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has , how was I to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own ?
Fanny Price	He took me wholly by surprise .
Fanny Price	I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning ; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me .
Fanny Price	In my situation , it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on Mr. Crawford .
Fanny Price	I am sure his sisters , rating him as they do , must have thought it so , supposing he had meant nothing .
Fanny Price	How , then , was I to be — to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me ?
Fanny Price	How was I to have an attachment at his service , as soon as it was asked for ?
Fanny Price	His sisters should consider me as well as him .
Fanny Price	The higher his deserts , the more improper for me ever to have thought of him .
Fanny Price	And , and — we think very differently of the nature of women , if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply . ” “ My dear , dear Fanny , now I have the truth .
Fanny Price	I know this to be the truth ; and most worthy of you are such feelings .
Fanny Price	I had attributed them to you before .
Fanny Price	I thought I could understand you .
Fanny Price	You have now given exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant , and they were both better satisfied , though your warm - hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry .
Fanny Price	I told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least ; and that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford ’s addresses was against him .
Fanny Price	Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour ; that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to ; and a great deal more to the same purpose , to give them a knowledge of your character .
Fanny Price	Fanny could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked for .
Fanny Price	Her feelings were all in revolt .
Fanny Price	She feared she had been doing wrong : saying too much , overacting the caution which she had been fancying necessary ; in guarding against one evil , laying herself open to another ; and to have Miss Crawford ’s liveliness repeated to her at such a moment , and on such a subject , was a bitter aggravation . Edmund saw weariness and distress in her face , and immediately resolved to forbear all farther discussion ; and not even to mention the name of Crawford again , except as it might be connected with what _ must _ be agreeable to her .
Fanny Price	You are sure , therefore , of seeing your friend either to - morrow or Sunday .
Fanny Price	Had I received any letter from Mansfield , to tell me how you were all going on , I believe I should certainly have staid ; but I knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight , and felt that I had been away long enough . ”
Fanny Price	“ The Miss Owens — you liked them , did not you ? ”
Fanny Price	But I am spoilt , Fanny , for common female society .
Fanny Price	You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice . ” Still , however , Fanny was oppressed and wearied ; he saw it in her looks , it could not be talked away ; and attempting it no more , he led her directly , with the kind authority of a privileged guardian , into the house .
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s eyes followed Edmund , and her heart beat for him as she heard this speech , and saw his look , and felt what his sensations must be .
Fanny Price	Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered , “ I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done , and ” ( with a bolder eye ) “ Miss Crawford is to be Amelia . ” “ I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up , with _ us _ , ” replied Edmund , turning away to the fire , where sat his mother , aunt , and Fanny , and seating himself with a look of great vexation .
Fanny Price	“ Sir Thomas would not like it.—Fanny , ring the bell ; I must have my dinner.—To be sure , Julia is dressed by this time .
Fanny Price	“ I am convinced , madam , ” said Edmund , preventing Fanny , “ that Sir Thomas would not like it . ” “ There , my dear , do you hear what Edmund says ? ” “ If I were to decline the part , ” said Maria , with renewed zeal , “ Julia would certainly take it . ” “ What ! ” cried Edmund , “ if she knew your reasons ! ”
Fanny Price	The actors may be glad , but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision ; and I do sincerely give you joy , madam , as well as Mrs. Norris , and everybody else who is in the same predicament , ” glancing half fearfully , half slyly , beyond Fanny to
Fanny Price	“ Fanny , ” cried Tom Bertram , from the other table , where the conference was eagerly carrying on , and the conversation incessant , “ we want your services . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny was up in a moment , expecting some errand ; for the habit of employing her in that way was not yet overcome , in spite of all that Edmund could do .
Fanny Price	we do not want to disturb you from your seat .
Fanny Price	We do not want your _ present _ services .
Fanny Price	We shall only want you in our play .
Fanny Price	You must be Cottager ’s wife .
Fanny Price	“ Me ! ” cried Fanny , sitting down again with a most frightened look .
Fanny Price	“ Indeed you must excuse me .
Fanny Price	I could not act anything if you were to give me the world .
Fanny Price	No , indeed , I can not act . ”
Fanny Price	“ Indeed , but you must , for we can not excuse you .
Fanny Price	It need not frighten you : it is a nothing of a part , a mere nothing , not above half a dozen speeches altogether , and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say ; so you may be as creep - mouse as you like , but we must have you to look at . ” “ If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches , ” cried Mr. Rushworth , “ what would you do with such a part as mine ?
Fanny Price	“ It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart , ” said Fanny , shocked to find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room , and to feel that almost every eye was upon her ; “ but I really can not act . ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , yes , you can act well enough for _ us _ .
Fanny Price	Learn your part , and we will teach you all the rest .
Fanny Price	You have only two scenes , and as I shall be Cottager , I ’ll put you in and push you about , and you will do it very well , I ’ll answer for it .
Fanny Price	“ No , indeed , Mr. Bertram , you must excuse me .
Fanny Price	It would be absolutely impossible for me .
Fanny Price	If I were to undertake it , I should only disappoint you . ”
Fanny Price	You ’ll do it very well .
Fanny Price	Every allowance will be made for you .
Fanny Price	You must get a brown gown , and a white apron , and a mob cap , and we must make you a few wrinkles , and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes , and you will be a very proper , little old woman .
Fanny Price	” “ You must excuse me , indeed you must excuse me , ” cried Fanny , growing more and more red from excessive agitation , and looking distressfully at Edmund , who was kindly observing her ; but unwilling to exasperate his brother by interference , gave her only an encouraging smile .
Fanny Price	Her entreaty had no effect on Tom : he only said again what he had said before ; and it was not merely Tom , for the requisition was now backed by Maria , and Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Yates , with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious , and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny ; and before she could breathe after it , Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you !
Fanny Price	“ Do not urge her , madam , ” said Edmund .
Fanny Price	“ It is not fair to urge her in this manner .
Fanny Price	You see she does not like to act .
Fanny Price	Let her chuse for herself , as well as the rest of us .
Fanny Price	Her judgment may be quite as safely trusted .
Fanny Price	Do not urge her any more . ”
Fanny Price	“ I am not going to urge her , ” replied Mrs. Norris sharply ; “ but I shall think her a very obstinate , ungrateful girl , if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her — very ungrateful , indeed , considering who and what she is .
Fanny Price	Edmund was too angry to speak ; but Miss Crawford , looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris , and then at Fanny , whose tears were beginning to shew themselves , immediately said , with some keenness , “ I do not like my situation : this _ place _ is too hot for me , ” and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table , close to Fanny , saying to her , in a kind , low whisper , as she placed herself , “ Never mind , my dear Miss Price , this is a cross evening : everybody is cross and teasing , but do not let us mind them ” ;
Fanny Price	Fanny did not love Miss Crawford ; but she felt very much obliged to her for her present kindness ;
Fanny Price	and when , from taking notice of her work , and wishing _ she _ could work as well , and begging for the pattern , and supposing Fanny was now preparing for her _ appearance _ , as of course she would come out when her cousin was married , Miss Crawford proceeded to inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea , and said that she had quite a curiosity to see him , and imagined him a very fine young man , and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea again — she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery , or help listening , and answering with more animation than she had intended .
Fanny Price	The consultation upon the play still went on , and Miss Crawford ’s attention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram ’s telling her , with infinite regret , that he found it absolutely impossible for him to undertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler : he had been most anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible , but it would not do ; he must give it up .
Fanny Price	“ I am not very sanguine as to our play , ” said Miss Crawford , in an undervoice to Fanny , after some consideration ; “ and I can tell Mr. Maddox that I shall shorten some of _ his _ speeches , and a great many of _ my _ _ own _ , before we rehearse together .
Fanny Price	“ But they , ” he observed to Fanny , “ have a claim .
Fanny Price	We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves : my sisters seem out of spirits , and Tom is certainly not at his ease .
Fanny Price	“ Do you think so ? ” said Fanny : “ in my opinion , my uncle would not like _ any _ addition .
Fanny Price	I think he values the very quietness you speak of , and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants .
Fanny Price	And it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be — I mean before my uncle went abroad .
Fanny Price	As well as I can recollect , it was always much the same .
Fanny Price	There was never much laughing in his presence ; or , if there is any difference , it is not more , I think , than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first .
Fanny Price	but I can not recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry , except when my uncle was in town .
Fanny Price	No young people ’s are , I suppose , when those they look up to are at home ” .
Fanny Price	“ I believe you are right , Fanny , ” was his reply , after a short consideration .
Fanny Price	I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before . ” “ I suppose I am graver than other people , ” said Fanny .
Fanny Price	“ The evenings do not appear long to me .
Fanny Price	I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies .
Fanny Price	I could listen to him for an hour together .
Fanny Price	It entertains _ me _ more than many other things have done ; but then I am unlike other people , I dare say . ”
Fanny Price	“ Why should you dare say _ that _ ? ” ( smiling ) .
Fanny Price	“ Do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet ?
Fanny Price	But when did you , or anybody , ever get a compliment from me , Fanny ?
Fanny Price	Go to my father if you want to be complimented .
Fanny Price	He will satisfy you .
Fanny Price	Ask your uncle what he thinks , and you will hear compliments enough : and
Fanny Price	though they may be chiefly on your person , you must put up with it , and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time . ” Such language was so new to Fanny that it quite embarrassed her . “ Your uncle thinks you very pretty , dear Fanny — and that is the long and the short of the matter .
Fanny Price	Anybody but myself would have made something more of it , and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before ; but the truth is , that your uncle never did admire you till now — and now he does .
Fanny Price	Your complexion is so improved!—and you have gained so much countenance!—and your figure
Fanny Price	— nay , Fanny , do not turn away about it — it is but an uncle .
Fanny Price	If you can not bear an uncle ’s admiration
Fanny Price	, what is to become of you ?
Fanny Price	You must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at .
Fanny Price	You must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman .
Fanny Price	do n’t talk so , do n’t talk so , ” cried Fanny , distressed by more feelings than he was aware of ; but seeing that she was distressed , he had done with the subject , and only added more seriously — “ Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect ; and
Fanny Price	I only wish you would talk to him more .
Fanny Price	You are one of those who are too silent in the evening circle . ”
Fanny Price	“ But I do talk to him more than I used .
Fanny Price	I am sure I do .
Fanny Price	Did not you hear me ask him about the slave - trade last night ? ”
Fanny Price	“ I did — and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others .
Fanny Price	It would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther . ”
Fanny Price	“ Miss Crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day : that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect .
Fanny Price	We were talking of you at the Parsonage , and those were her words .
Fanny Price	She certainly understands _ you _ better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long ; and with regard to some others , I can perceive , from occasional lively hints , the unguarded expressions of the moment , that she could define _ many _ as accurately , did not delicacy forbid it .
Fanny Price	“ She must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you , ” said Fanny , with half a sigh , “ to have any such apprehension .
Fanny Price	After a little while , I dare say , we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way , allowing for the difference of the time of year . ”
Fanny Price	I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country ; and November is a still more serious month , and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on . ” Fanny could have said a great deal , but it was safer to say nothing , and leave untouched all Miss Crawford ’s resources — her accomplishments , her spirits , her importance , her friends , lest it should betray her into any observations seemingly unhandsome .
Fanny Price	“ To - morrow , I think , my uncle dines at Sotherton , and you and Mr. Bertram too .
Fanny Price	“ That is impossible , Fanny .
Fanny Price	XXIII “ But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny
Fanny Price	? ” said Lady Bertram .
Fanny Price	“ How came she to think of asking Fanny ?
Fanny Price	Fanny never dines there , you know , in this sort of way .
Fanny Price	I can not spare her , and I am sure she does not want to go .
Fanny Price	Fanny , you do not want to go , do you ? ”
Fanny Price	“ If you put such a question to her , ” cried Edmund , preventing his cousin ’s speaking , “ Fanny will immediately say No ; but I am sure ,
Fanny Price	my
Fanny Price	dear mother , she would like to go ; and I can see no reason why she should not . ”
Fanny Price	“ I can not imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her ?
Fanny Price	She never did before .
Fanny Price	She used to ask your sisters now and then , but she never asked Fanny .
Fanny Price	“ If you can not do without me , ma’am — ” said Fanny , in a self - denying tone .
Fanny Price	“ But my mother will have my father with her all the evening . ” “ To be sure , so I shall . ” “ Suppose you take my father ’s opinion , ma’am . ” “ That ’s well thought of .
Fanny Price	I will ask Sir Thomas , as soon as he comes in , whether I can do without her . ”
Fanny Price	“ As you please , ma’am , on that head ; but I meant my father ’s opinion as to the _ propriety _ of the invitation ’s being accepted or not ; and I think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant , as well as by Fanny , that being the _ first _ invitation it should be accepted . ”
Fanny Price	But he will be very much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all .
Fanny Price	Her story began ; and Fanny immediately slipped out of the room ; for to hear herself the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than her nerves could bear .
Fanny Price	She was anxious , she knew — more anxious perhaps than she ought to be — for what was it after all whether she went or staid ?
Fanny Price	but if her uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding , and with very grave looks , and those grave looks directed to her , and at last decide against her , she might not be able to appear properly submissive and indifferent .
Fanny Price	Her cause , meanwhile , went on well .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner .
Fanny Price	“ Well , ” said Sir Thomas , as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise . “ Edmund wants her to go .
Fanny Price	But how can I spare her ? ”
Fanny Price	“ She will be late , ” said Sir Thomas , taking out his watch ; “ but what is your difficulty ? ”
Fanny Price	He told the whole ; and she had only to add , “ So strange ! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her . ” “ But is it not very natural , ” observed Edmund , “ that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? ” “ Nothing can be more natural , ” said Sir Thomas , after a short deliberation ; “ nor , were there no sister in the case , could anything , in my opinion , be more natural .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Grant ’s shewing civility to Miss
Fanny Price	Price , to Lady Bertram ’s niece , could never want explanation .
Fanny Price	Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer .
Fanny Price	She appears to feel as she ought .
Fanny Price	But as I conclude that she must wish to go , since all young people like to be together , I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence . ” “ But can I do without her , Sir Thomas ?
Fanny Price	” “ Indeed I think you may . ” “ She always makes tea , you know , when my sister is not here . ” “ Your sister , perhaps , may be prevailed on to spend the day with us , and I shall certainly be at home . ”
Fanny Price	“ Very well , then , Fanny may go , Edmund . ”
Fanny Price	The good news soon followed her .
Fanny Price	Edmund knocked at her door in his way to his own .
Fanny Price	“ Well , Fanny , it is all happily settled , and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle ’s side .
Fanny Price	You are to go .
Fanny Price	“ Thank you , I am _ so _ glad , ” was Fanny ’s instinctive reply ; though when she had turned from him and shut the door , she could not help feeling , “ And yet why should I be glad ?
Fanny Price	for am I not certain of seeing or hearing something there to pain me ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Upon my word , Fanny , you are in high luck to meet with such attention and indulgence !
Fanny Price	You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking of you , and to your aunt for letting you go , and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary ; for I hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way , or ever dining out at all ; and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated .
Fanny Price	Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to _ you _ ; the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to _ us _ to take a little notice of you , or else it would never have come into her head , and you may be very certain that , if your cousin Julia had been at home , you would not have been asked at all .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant ’s part of the favour , that Fanny , who found herself expected to speak , could only say that she was very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her , and that she was endeavouring to put her aunt ’s evening work in such a state as to prevent her being missed .
Fanny Price	depend upon it , your aunt can do very well without you , or you would not be allowed to go .
Fanny Price	_ I _ shall be here , so you may be quite easy about your aunt .
Fanny Price	And I hope you will have a very _ agreeable _ day , and find it all mighty _ delightful _ .
Fanny Price	But I must observe that five is the very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table ; and I can not but be surprised that such an _ elegant _ lady as Mrs. Grant should not contrive better !
Fanny Price	Remember that , Fanny .
Fanny Price	However , you will have dinner enough on it for ten , I dare say . ”
Fanny Price	Mrs. Norris fetched breath , and went on again . “ The nonsense and folly of people ’s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves , makes me think it right to give _ you _ a hint , Fanny , now that you are going into company without any of us ; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward , and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins — as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia .
Fanny Price	Remember , wherever you are , you must be the lowest and last ; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage
Fanny Price	, you are not to be taking place of her .
Fanny Price	And as to coming away at night , you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses .
Fanny Price	” “ Yes , ma’am , I should not think of anything else . ”
Fanny Price	“ And if it should rain , which I think exceedingly likely , for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life , you must manage as well as you can , and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you .
Fanny Price	I certainly do not go home to - night , and , therefore , the carriage will not be out on my account ; so you must make up your mind to what may happen , and take your things accordingly .
Fanny Price	She rated her own claims to comfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could ; and when Sir Thomas soon afterwards , just opening the door , said , “ Fanny , at what time would you have the carriage come round ? ” she felt a degree of astonishment which made it impossible for her to speak .
Fanny Price	“ My dear Sir Thomas ! ” cried Mrs. Norris , red with anger , “ Fanny can walk . ”
Fanny Price	“ My niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year !
Fanny Price	Will twenty minutes after four suit you ?
Fanny Price	“ Yes , sir , ” was Fanny ’s humble answer , given with the feelings almost of a criminal towards Mrs. Norris ; and not bearing to remain with her in what might seem a state of triumph , she followed her uncle out of the room , having staid behind him only long enough to hear these words spoken in angry agitation — “ Quite unnecessary !
Fanny Price	But this could not impose on Fanny .
Fanny Price	She felt that the carriage was for herself , and herself alone : and her uncle ’s consideration of her , coming immediately after such representations from her aunt , cost her some tears of gratitude when she was alone .
Fanny Price	The coachman drove round to a minute ; another minute brought down the gentleman ; and as the lady had , with a most scrupulous fear of being late , been many minutes seated in the drawing - room , Sir Thomas saw them off in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required .
Fanny Price	“ Now I must look at you , Fanny , ” said Edmund , with the kind smile of an affectionate brother , “ and tell you how I like you ; and as well as I can judge by this light , you look very nicely indeed .
Fanny Price	What have you got on ? ” “ The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin ’s marriage .
Fanny Price	I hope it is not too fine ; but I thought I ought to wear it as soon as I could , and that I might not have such another opportunity all the winter .
Fanny Price	I hope you do not think me too fine . ” “ A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white .
Fanny Price	No , I see no finery about you ; nothing but what is perfectly proper .
Fanny Price	Your gown seems very pretty .
Fanny Price	And letting down the side - glass to distinguish , “ ’ Tis Crawford ’s , Crawford ’s barouche , I protest !
Fanny Price	This is quite a surprise , Fanny .
Fanny Price	I shall be very glad to see him .
Fanny Price	” There was no occasion , there was no time for Fanny to say how very differently she felt ; but the idea of having such another to observe her was a great increase of the trepidation with which she performed the very awful ceremony of walking into the drawing - room .
Fanny Price	A very cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund ; and with the exception of Fanny , the pleasure was general ; and even to _ her _ there might be some advantage in his presence , since every addition to the party must rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered to sit silent and unattended to .
Fanny Price	while they were at table , such a happy flow of conversation prevailing , in which she was not required to take any part — there was so much to be said between the brother and sister about Bath , so much between the two young men about hunting , so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and Dr. Grant , and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawford and Mrs. Grant , as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to listen in quiet , and of passing a very agreeable day .
Fanny Price	She could not compliment the newly arrived gentleman , however , with any appearance of interest , in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield , and sending for his hunters from Norfolk , which , suggested by Dr. Grant , advised by Edmund , and warmly urged by the two sisters , was soon in possession of his mind , and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her
Fanny Price	Here he was again on the same ground where all had passed before , and apparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams , as if he had never known Mansfield in any other state . She heard them spoken of by him only in a general way , till they were all re - assembled in the drawing - room , when Edmund , being engaged apart in some matter of business with Dr. Grant , which seemed entirely to engross them , and Mrs. Grant occupied at the tea - table , he began talking of them with more particularity to his other sister .
Fanny Price	With a significant smile , which made Fanny quite hate him , he said , “ So !
Fanny Price	Rushworth and his fair bride are at Brighton , I understand ; happy man ! ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , they have been there about a fortnight , Miss Price , have they not ?
Fanny Price	And Julia is with them . ”
Fanny Price	“ And Mr. Yates , I presume , is not far off . ” “ Mr. Yates !
Fanny Price	I do not imagine he figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park ; do you , Miss Price ?
Fanny Price	I think my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her father with Mr. Yates . ”
Fanny Price	“ Poor Rushworth and his two - and - forty speeches ! ” continued Crawford .
Fanny Price	And then changing his tone again to one of gentle gallantry , and addressing Fanny , he said , “ You were Mr. Rushworth ’s best friend .
Fanny Price	Your kindness and patience can never be forgotten , your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part — in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied — to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own !
Fanny Price	_ He _ might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness , but I may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny coloured , and said nothing .
Fanny Price	With silent indignation Fanny repeated to herself , “ Never happier!—never happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable!—never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly !
Fanny Price	“ We were unlucky , Miss Price , ” he continued , in a lower tone , to avoid the possibility of being heard by Edmund , and not at all aware of her feelings , “ we certainly were very unlucky .
Fanny Price	I think , Miss Price , we would have indulged ourselves with a week ’s calm in the Atlantic at that season . ” He seemed determined to be answered ; and Fanny , averting her face , said , with a firmer tone than usual , “ As far as _ I _ am concerned , sir , I would not have delayed his return for a day .
Fanny Price	My uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive , that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough .
Fanny Price	She had never spoken so much at once to him in her life before , and never so angrily to any one ; and when her speech was over , she trembled and blushed at her own daring .
Fanny Price	He was surprised ; but after a few moments ’ silent consideration of her , replied in a calmer , graver tone , and as if the candid result of conviction , “ I believe you are right .
Fanny Price	And then turning the conversation , he would have engaged her on some other subject , but her answers were so shy and reluctant that he could not advance in any .
Fanny Price	Miss Crawford , who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund , now observed , “ Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss . ”
Fanny Price	Dr. Grant is giving Bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon .
Fanny Price	find he takes orders in a few weeks .
Fanny Price	I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off .
Fanny Price	He will have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with , and earned without much trouble .
Fanny Price	I apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year .
Fanny Price	Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother ; and as of course he will still live at home , it will be all for his _ menus _ _ plaisirs _ ; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter , I suppose , will be the sum total of sacrifice .
Fanny Price	His sister tried to laugh off her feelings by saying , “ Nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves .
Fanny Price	“ Perhaps I might ; but all _ that _ you know is entirely comparative . Birthright and habit must settle the business .
Fanny Price	Bertram is certainly well off for a cadet of even a baronet ’s family .
Fanny Price	By the time he is four or five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year , and nothing to do for it .
Fanny Price	“ Bertram , ” said Henry Crawford , “ I shall make a point of coming to Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon .
Fanny Price	Miss Price , will not you join me in encouraging your cousin ?
Fanny Price	Will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time — as I shall do — not to lose a word ; or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful ?
Fanny Price	You must preach at Mansfield , you know , that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you .
Fanny Price	“ Will he not feel this ? ” thought Fanny .
Fanny Price	The party being now all united , and the chief talkers attracting each other , she remained in tranquillity ; and as a whist - table was formed after tea — formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant , by his attentive wife , though it was not to be supposed so — and Miss Crawford took her harp , she had nothing to do but to listen ; and
Fanny Price	” “ It was a hard case , upon my word ” ; and , “ I do think you were very much to be pitied , ” were the kind responses of listening sympathy .
Fanny Price	Well , the jointure may comfort _ him _ ; and perhaps , between friends , he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the Baron , and was not sorry to withdraw ; and to make _ you _ amends , Yates , I think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield , and ask you to be our manager .
Fanny Price	“ I believe we must be satisfied with _ less _ , ” said Maria .
Fanny Price	Maria , Julia , Henry Crawford , and Mr. Yates were in the billiard - room .
Fanny Price	Tom , returning from them into the drawing - room , where Edmund was standing thoughtfully by the fire , while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at a little distance , and Fanny close beside her arranging her work , thus began as he entered—“Such a horribly vile billiard - table as ours is not to be met with , I believe , above ground .
Fanny Price	It would shew great want of feeling on my father ’s account , absent as he is , and in some degree of constant danger ; and it would be imprudent , I think , with regard to Maria , whose situation is a very delicate one , considering everything , extremely delicate .
Fanny Price	Lady Bertram , sunk back in one corner of the sofa , the picture of health , wealth , ease , and tranquillity , was just falling into a gentle doze , while Fanny was getting through the few difficulties of her work for her .
Fanny Price	You must see the difference yourself .
Fanny Price	I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have ; and as to such alterations as I was suggesting just now , such as moving a bookcase , or unlocking a door , or even as using the billiard - room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it , you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room , and less in the breakfast - room , than we did before he went away , or to my sister ’s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other .
Fanny Price	Fanny , who had heard it all , and borne Edmund company in every feeling throughout the whole
Fanny Price	, now ventured to say , in her anxiety to suggest some comfort , “ Perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit them .
Fanny Price	“ I have no hope there , Fanny .
Fanny Price	“ I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side . ”
Fanny Price	Julia _ did _ seem inclined to admit that Maria ’s situation might require particular caution and delicacy — but that could not extend to _ her_—she was at liberty ; and Maria evidently considered her engagement as only raising her so much more above restraint , and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult either father or mother .
Fanny Price	Maria gave Edmund a glance , which meant , “ What say you now ?
Fanny Price	as the whole arrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody , and none at all to herself , as she foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry , bustle , and importance , and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself obliged to leave her own house , where she had been living a month at her own cost , and take up her abode in theirs , that every hour might be spent in their service , she was , in fact , exceedingly delighted with the project .
Fanny Price	after tea , as Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight scene , while the Miss Bertrams , Mr. Rushworth , and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte , she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group , and saying , “ How happy Mr. Rushworth looks !
Fanny Price	“ Your father ’s return will be a very interesting event . ”
Fanny Price	“ It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events : your sister ’s marriage , and your taking orders . ” “ Yes . ”
Fanny Price	My other sacrifice , of course , you do not understand . ”
Fanny Price	“ My taking orders , I assure you , is quite as voluntary as Maria ’s marrying . ”
Fanny Price	“ It is fortunate that your inclination and your father ’s convenience should accord so well .
Fanny Price	There is a very good living kept for you , I understand , hereabouts . ”
Fanny Price	“ Which you suppose has biassed me ? ”
Fanny Price	“ But _ that _ I am sure it has not , ” cried Fanny .
Fanny Price	“ Thank you for your good word , Fanny , but it is more than I would affirm myself .
Fanny Price	On the contrary , the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me .
Fanny Price	Nor can I think it wrong that it should .
Fanny Price	There was no natural disinclination to be overcome , and I see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life .
Fanny Price	I was in safe hands .
Fanny Price	I hope I should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way , and I am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it .
Fanny Price	I have no doubt that I was biased , but I think it was blamelessly .
Fanny Price	” “ It is the same sort of thing , ” said Fanny , after a short pause , “ as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy , or the son of a general to be in the army , and nobody sees anything wrong in that .
Fanny Price	Nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best , or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear . ” “ No , my dear Miss Price , and for reasons good .
Fanny Price	“ But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected , you think ? ” said Edmund .
Fanny Price	“ To be justified in your eyes , he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision . ”
Fanny Price	“ Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled , if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without ?
Fanny Price	As he can not be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession , as heroism , and noise , and fashion , are all against him , he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his . ”
Fanny Price	suspect that in this comprehensive and ( may I say ) commonplace censure , you are not judging from yourself , but from prejudiced persons , whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing .
Fanny Price	It is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy .
Fanny Price	You can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively .
Fanny Price	You are speaking what you have been told at your uncle ’s table . ”
Fanny Price	“ I speak what appears to me the general opinion ; and where an opinion is general , it is usually correct .
Fanny Price	Though _ I _ have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen , it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information . ”
Fanny Price	Your uncle , and his brother admirals ,
Fanny Price	, ” was a tender apostrophe of Fanny ’s , very much to the purpose of her own feelings if not of the conversation .
Fanny Price	And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me , and though he is really a gentleman , and , I dare say , a good scholar and clever , and often preaches good sermons , and is very respectable , _ I _ see him to be an indolent , selfish _ bon _ _ vivant _ , who must have his palate consulted in everything ; who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one ; and who , moreover , if the cook makes a blunder , is out of humour with his excellent wife .
Fanny Price	To own the truth , Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose , which he could not get the better of .
Fanny Price	My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it . ”
Fanny Price	“ I do not wonder at your disapprobation , upon my word .
Fanny Price	It is a great defect of temper , made worse by a very faulty habit of self - indulgence ; and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours .
Fanny Price	Fanny , it goes against us .
Fanny Price	“ No , ” replied Fanny , “ but we need not give up his profession for all that ; because , whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen , he would have taken a — not a good temper into it ; and as he must , either in the navy or army , have had a great many more people under his command than he has now , I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman .
Fanny Price	“ We can not prove to the contrary , to be sure ; but I wish you a better fate , Miss Price , than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons ; for though he may preach himself into a good - humour every Sunday , it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night . ”
Fanny Price	“ I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny , ” said Edmund affectionately , “ must be beyond the reach of any sermons . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny turned farther into the window ; and Miss Crawford had only time to say , in a pleasant manner , “ I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it ” ; when , being earnestly invited by the Miss Bertrams to join in a glee , she tripped off to the instrument , leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many virtues , from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread .
Fanny Price	Fanny agreed to it , and had the pleasure of seeing him continue at the window with her , in spite of the expected glee ; and of having his eyes soon turned , like hers , towards the scene without , where all that was solemn , and soothing , and lovely , appeared in the brilliancy of an unclouded night , and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods .
Fanny Price	Fanny spoke her feelings .
Fanny Price	“ Here ’s harmony ! ” said she ; “ here ’s repose !
Fanny Price	When I look out on such a night as this , I feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world ; and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more attended to , and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene . ” “ I like to hear your enthusiasm , Fanny .
Fanny Price	are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel , in some degree , as you do ; who have not , at least , been given a taste for Nature in early life . They lose a great deal .
Fanny Price	“ _ You _ taught me to think and feel on the subject , cousin . ” “ I had a very apt scholar .
Fanny Price	I wish I could see Cassiopeia . ”
Fanny Price	Should you be afraid ? ” “ Not in the least .
Fanny Price	“ Yes ; I do not know how it has happened . ”
Fanny Price	“ We will stay till this is finished , Fanny , ” said he , turning his back on the window ; and as it advanced , she had the mortification of seeing him advance too , moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument , and when it ceased , he was close by the singers , among the most urgent in requesting to hear the glee again .
Fanny Price	Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris ’s threats of catching cold .
Fanny Price	“ Well , ” said he , “ if you really think I had better go : it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her so long ago , and getting quite impatient , she resolved to go in search of them .
Fanny Price	She followed their steps along the bottom walk , and had just turned up into another , when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford once more caught her ear ; the sound approached , and a few more windings brought them before her .
Fanny Price	They were just returned into the wilderness from the park , to which a sidegate , not fastened , had tempted them very soon after their leaving her , and they had been across a portion of the park into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning to reach at last , and had been sitting down under one of the trees .
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s best consolation was in being assured that Edmund had wished for her very much , and that he should certainly have come back for her , had she not been tired already ; but this was not quite sufficient to do away with the pain of having been left a whole hour , when he had talked of only a few minutes , nor to banish the sort of curiosity she felt to know what they had been conversing about all that time ; and the result of the whole was to her disappointment and depression , as they prepared by general agreement to return to the house .
Fanny Price	By their own accounts they had been all walking after each other , and the junction which had taken place at last seemed , to Fanny ’s observation , to have been as much too late for re - establishing harmony , as it confessedly had been for determining on
Fanny Price	She felt , as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth , that hers was not the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them : there was gloom on the face of each .
Fanny Price	Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more gay , and she thought that he was taking particular pains , during dinner , to do away any little resentment of the other two , and restore general good - humour .
Fanny Price	“ Well , Fanny , this has been a fine day for you , upon my word , ” said Mrs. Norris , as they drove through the park .
Fanny Price	I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go .
Fanny Price	A pretty good day ’s amusement you have had ! ”
Fanny Price	“ My dear , it is only a beautiful little heath , which that nice old gardener would make me take ; but if it is in your way , I will have it in my lap directly .
Fanny Price	There , Fanny , you shall carry that parcel for me ; take great care of it : do not let it fall ; it is a cream cheese , just like the excellent one we had at dinner .
Fanny Price	Take care of the cheese , Fanny .
Fanny Price	And if I have good luck , your mother shall have some .
Fanny Price	My Fanny , indeed , at this very time , I have the satisfaction of knowing , must have been happy in spite of everything .
Fanny Price	She must have been a happy creature in spite of all that she felt , or thought she felt , for the distress of those around her .
Fanny Price	She had sources of delight that must force their way .
Fanny Price	She was returned to Mansfield Park , she was useful , she was beloved ; she was safe from Mr. Crawford ; and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits , of his perfect approbation and increased regard ; and happy as all this must make her , she would still have been happy without any of it , for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford .
Fanny Price	She knew it was so , and was sorry ; but it was with a sorrow so founded on satisfaction , so tending to ease , and so much in harmony with every dearest sensation , that there are few who might not have been glad to exchange their greatest gaiety for it .
Fanny Price	After wandering about and sitting under trees with Fanny all the summer evenings , he had so well talked his mind into submission as to be very tolerably cheerful again .
Fanny Price	She had lived with him to be reproached as the ruin of all his happiness in Fanny , and carried away no better consolation in leaving him than that she _ had _ divided them .
Fanny Price	Where she could be placed became a subject of most melancholy and momentous consultation .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Norris , whose attachment seemed to augment with the demerits of her niece , would have had her received at home and countenanced by them all .
Fanny Price	Sir Thomas would not hear of it ; and Mrs. Norris ’s anger against Fanny was so much the greater , from considering _ her _ residence there as the motive .
Fanny Price	As a daughter , he hoped a penitent one , she should be protected by him , and secured in every comfort , and supported by every encouragement to do right , which their relative situations admitted ; but farther than _ that _ he could not go .
Fanny Price	Maria had destroyed her own character , and he would not , by a vain attempt to restore what never could be restored , by affording his sanction to vice , or in seeking to lessen its disgrace , be anywise accessory to introducing such misery in another man ’s family as he had known himself .
Fanny Price	It ended in Mrs. Norris ’s resolving to quit Mansfield and devote herself to her unfortunate Maria , and in an establishment being formed for them in another country , remote and private , where , shut up together with little society , on one side no affection , on the other no judgment , it may be reasonably supposed that their tempers became their mutual punishment
Fanny Price	Not even Fanny had tears for aunt Norris , not even when she was gone for ever .
Fanny Price	That Julia escaped better than Maria was owing , in some measure , to a favourable difference of disposition and circumstance , but in a greater to her having been less the darling of that very aunt , less flattered and less spoilt .
Fanny Price	She had been always used to think herself a little inferior to Maria .
Fanny Price	Maria ’s guilt had induced Julia ’s folly .
Fanny Price	Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one amiable woman ’s affections , could he have found sufficient exultation in overcoming the reluctance , in working himself into the esteem and tenderness of Fanny Price , there would have been every probability of success and felicity for him .
Fanny Price	Her influence over him had already given him some influence over her .
Fanny Price	Would he have deserved more , there can be no doubt that more would have been obtained , especially when that marriage had taken place , which would have given him the assistance of her conscience in subduing her first inclination , and brought them very often together .
Fanny Price	Would he have persevered , and uprightly , Fanny must have been his reward , and a reward very voluntarily bestowed , within a reasonable period from Edmund ’s marrying Mary .
Fanny Price	He saw Mrs. Rushworth , was received by her with a coldness which ought to have been repulsive , and have established apparent indifference between them for ever ; but he was mortified , he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose smiles had been so wholly at his command : he must exert himself to subdue so proud a display of resentment ; it was anger on Fanny ’s account ; he must get the better of it , and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram again in her treatment of himself .
Fanny Price	To keep Fanny and the Bertrams from a knowledge of what was passing became his first object .
Fanny Price	All that followed was the result of her imprudence ; and he went off with her at last , because he could not help it , regretting Fanny even at the moment , but regretting her infinitely more when all the bustle of the intrigue was over , and a very few months had taught him , by the force of contrast , to place a yet higher value on the sweetness of her temper , the purity of her mind , and the excellence of her principles .
Fanny Price	In this world the penalty is less equal than could be wished ; but without presuming to look forward to a juster appointment hereafter , we may fairly consider a man of sense , like Henry Crawford , to be providing for himself no small portion of vexation and regret : vexation that must rise sometimes to self - reproach , and regret to wretchedness , in having so requited hospitality , so injured family peace , so forfeited his best , most estimable , and endeared acquaintance , and so lost the woman whom he had rationally as well as passionately loved .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Grant , with a temper to love and be loved , must have gone with some regret from the scenes and people she had been used to ; but the same happiness of disposition must in any place , and any society , secure her a great deal to enjoy , and she had again a home to offer Mary ; and Mary had had enough of her own friends , enough of vanity , ambition , love , and disappointment in the course of the last half - year , to be in need of the true kindness of her sister ’s heart , and the rational tranquillity of her ways .
Fanny Price	Mary , though perfectly resolved against ever attaching herself to a younger brother again , was long in finding among the dashing representatives , or idle heir - apparents , who were at the command of her beauty , and her £ 20,000 , any one who could satisfy the better taste she had acquired at Mansfield , whose character and manners could authorise a hope of the domestic happiness she had there learned to estimate , or put Edmund Bertram sufficiently out of her head .
Fanny Price	Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford , and observing to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such another woman , before it began to strike him whether a very different kind of woman might not do just as well , or a great deal better : whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear , as important to him in all her smiles and all her ways , as Mary Crawford had ever been ; and whether it might not be a possible , a hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love . I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion , that every one may be at liberty to fix their own , aware that the cure of unconquerable passions , and the transfer of unchanging attachments , must vary much as to time in different people .
Fanny Price	I only entreat everybody to believe that exactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so , and not a week earlier , Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford , and became as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire .
Fanny Price	With such a regard for her , indeed , as his had long been , a regard founded on the most endearing claims of innocence and helplessness , and completed by every recommendation of growing worth , what could be more natural than the change ?
Fanny Price	Loving , guiding , protecting her , as he had been doing ever since her being ten years old , her mind in so great a degree formed by his care , and her comfort depending on his kindness , an object to him of such close and peculiar interest , dearer by all his own importance with her than any one else at Mansfield , what was there now to add , but that he should learn to prefer soft light eyes to sparkling dark ones .
Fanny Price	And being always with her , and always talking confidentially , and his feelings exactly in that favourable state which a recent disappointment gives , those soft light eyes could not be very long in obtaining the pre - eminence .
Fanny Price	, there was nothing on the side of prudence to stop him or make his progress slow ; no doubts of her deserving , no fears of opposition of taste , no need of drawing new hopes of happiness from dissimilarity of temper .
Fanny Price	Her mind , disposition , opinions , and habits wanted no half - concealment , no self - deception on the present , no reliance on future improvement .
Fanny Price	Even in the midst of his late infatuation , he had acknowledged Fanny ’s mental superiority .
Fanny Price	She was of course only too good for him ; but as nobody minds having what is too good for them , he was very steadily earnest in the pursuit of the blessing , and it was not possible that encouragement from her should be long wanting .
Fanny Price	Sick of ambitious and mercenary connexions , prizing more and more the sterling good of principle and temper , and chiefly anxious to bind by the strongest securities all that remained to him of domestic felicity , he had pondered with genuine satisfaction on the more than possibility of the two young friends finding their natural consolation in each other for all that had occurred of disappointment to either ; and the joyful consent which met Edmund ’s application , the high sense of having realised a great acquisition in the promise of Fanny for a daughter , formed just such a contrast with his early opinion on the subject when the poor little girl ’s coming had been first agitated , as time is for ever producing between the plans and decisions of mortals , for their own instruction , and their neighbours ’ entertainment .
Fanny Price	Fanny was indeed the daughter that he wanted .
Fanny Price	But it was possible to part with her , because Susan remained to supply her place .
Fanny Price	Susan became the stationary niece , delighted to be so ; and equally well adapted for it by a readiness of mind , and an inclination for usefulness , as Fanny had been by sweetness of temper , and strong feelings of gratitude .
Fanny Price	First as a comfort to Fanny , then as an auxiliary , and last as her substitute , she was established at Mansfield , with every appearance of equal permanency .
Fanny Price	With quickness in understanding the tempers of those she had to deal with , and no natural timidity to restrain any consequent wishes , she was soon welcome and useful to all ; and after Fanny ’s removal succeeded so naturally to her influence over the hourly comfort of her aunt , as gradually to become , perhaps , the most beloved of the two .
Fanny Price	In _ her _ usefulness , in Fanny ’s excellence , in William ’s continued good conduct and rising fame , and in the general well - doing and success of the other members of the family , all assisting to advance each other , and doing credit to his countenance and aid , Sir Thomas saw repeated , and for ever repeated , reason to rejoice in what he had done for them all , and acknowledge the advantages of early hardship and discipline , and the consciousness of being born to struggle and endure .
Fanny Price	On that event they removed to Mansfield ; and the Parsonage there , which , under each of its two former owners , Fanny had never been able to approach but with some painful sensation of restraint or alarm , soon grew as dear to her heart , and as thoroughly perfect in her eyes ,
Fanny Price	His mind , now disengaged from the cares which had pressed on him at first , was at leisure to find the Grants and their young inmates really worth visiting ; and though infinitely above scheming or contriving for any the most advantageous matrimonial establishment that could be among the apparent possibilities of any one most dear to him , and disdaining even as a littleness the being quick - sighted on such points , he could not avoid perceiving , in a grand and careless way , that Mr. Crawford was somewhat distinguishing his niece — nor perhaps refrain ( though unconsciously ) from giving a more willing assent to invitations on that account .
Fanny Price	His readiness , however , in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage , when the general invitation was at last hazarded , after many debates and many doubts as to whether it were worth while , “ because Sir Thomas seemed so ill inclined , and Lady Bertram was so indolent ! ”
Fanny Price	proceeded from good - breeding and goodwill alone , and had nothing to do with Mr. Crawford , but as being one in an agreeable group : for it was in the course of that very visit that he first began to think that any one in the habit of such idle observations _ would _ _ have _ _ thought _ that Mr. Crawford was the admirer of Fanny Price .
Fanny Price	The meeting was generally felt to be a pleasant one , being composed in a good proportion of those who would talk and those who would listen ; and the dinner itself was elegant and plentiful , according to the usual style of the Grants , and too much according to the usual habits of all to raise any emotion except in Mrs. Norris , who could never behold either the wide table or the number of dishes on it with patience , and who did always contrive to experience some evil from the passing of the servants behind her chair , and to bring away some fresh conviction of its being impossible among so many dishes but that some must be cold .
Fanny Price	In the evening it was found , according to the predetermination of Mrs. Grant and her sister , that after making up the whist - table there would remain sufficient for a round game , and everybody being as perfectly complying and without a choice as on such occasions they always are , speculation was decided on almost as soon as whist ; and Lady Bertram soon found herself in the critical situation of being applied to for her own choice between the games , and being required either to draw a card for whist or not .
Fanny Price	He was a whist player himself , and perhaps might feel that it would not much amuse him to have her for a partner .
Fanny Price	“ Very well , ” was her ladyship ’s contented answer ; “ then speculation , if you please , Mrs. Grant .
Fanny Price	I know nothing about it , but Fanny must teach me . ”
Fanny Price	Here Fanny interposed , however , with anxious protestations of her own equal ignorance ; she had never played the game nor seen it played in her life ; and Lady Bertram felt a moment ’s indecision again ; but upon everybody ’s assuring her that nothing could be so easy , that it was the easiest game on the cards , and Henry Crawford ’s stepping forward with a most earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss Price , and teach them both , it was so settled ; and Sir Thomas , Mrs. Norris , and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime intellectual state and dignity , the remaining six , under Miss Crawford ’s direction , were arranged round the other .
Fanny Price	It was a fine arrangement for Henry Crawford , who was close to Fanny , and with his hands full of business , having two persons ’ cards to manage as well as his own ; for though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself mistress of the rules of the game in three minutes , he had yet to inspirit her play , sharpen her avarice , and harden her heart ,
Fanny Price	which , especially in any competition with William , was a work of some difficulty ; and as for Lady Bertram , he must continue in charge of all her fame and fortune through the whole evening ; and if quick enough to keep her from looking at her cards when the deal began , must direct her in whatever was to be done with them to the end of it
Fanny Price	Twice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of his lady , but in vain ; no pause was long enough for the time his measured manner needed ; and very little of her state could be known till Mrs. Grant was able , at the end of the first rubber , to go to her and pay her compliments . “ I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game . ”
Fanny Price	I do not know what it is all about .
Fanny Price	I am never to see my cards ; and Mr. Crawford does all the rest . ”
Fanny Price	“ It sounds like it , ” said Edmund ; “ but which way did you turn after passing Sewell ’s farm ? ”
Fanny Price	“ You inquired , then ? ”
Fanny Price	Thornton Lacey was the name of his impending living , as Miss Crawford well knew ; and her interest in a negotiation for William Price ’s knave increased .
Fanny Price	“ Well , ” continued Edmund , “ and how did you like what you saw ? ” “ Very much indeed .
Fanny Price	” Miss Crawford , a little suspicious and resentful of a certain tone of voice , and a certain half - look attending the last expression of his hope , made a hasty finish of her dealings with William Price ; and securing his knave at an exorbitant rate , exclaimed , “ There , I will stake my last like a woman of spirit .
Fanny Price	No cold prudence for me .
Fanny Price	I am not born to sit still and do nothing .
Fanny Price	If I lose the game , it shall not be from not striving for it .
Fanny Price	” The game was hers , and only did not pay her for what she had given to secure it .
Fanny Price	Miss Crawford listened , and Edmund agreed to this .
Fanny Price	Lady Bertram does not bid a dozen .
Fanny Price	She will have nothing to say to it .
Fanny Price	All this may be stamped on it ; and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road ; especially as there is no real squire ’s house to dispute the point — a circumstance , between ourselves , to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation . _ You _ think with me , I hope ” ( turning with a softened voice to Fanny ) .
Fanny Price	Fanny gave a quick negative , and tried to hide her interest in the subject by an eager attention to her brother , who was driving as hard a bargain , and imposing on her as much as he could ; but Crawford pursued with “ No , no , you must not part with the queen .
Fanny Price	You have bought her too dearly , and your brother does not offer half her value .
Fanny Price	Your sister does not part with the queen .
Fanny Price	She is quite determined .
Fanny Price	The game will be yours , ” turning to her again ; “ it will certainly be yours .
Fanny Price	“ And Fanny had much rather it were William ’s , ” said Edmund , smiling at her .
Fanny Price	“ Poor Fanny ! not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes ! ”
Fanny Price	“ Mr. Bertram , ” said Miss Crawford , a few minutes afterwards , “ you know Henry to be such a capital improver , that you can not possibly engage in anything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help .
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s eyes were turned on Crawford for a moment with an expression more than grave — even reproachful ; but on catching his , were instantly withdrawn .
Fanny Price	With something of consciousness he shook his head at his sister , and laughingly replied , “ I can not say there was much done at Sotherton ; but it was a hot day , and we were all walking after each other , and bewildered . ”
Fanny Price	As soon as a general buzz gave him shelter , he added , in a low voice , directed solely at Fanny , “ I should be sorry to have my powers of _ planning _ judged of by the day at Sotherton .
Fanny Price	Sotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris , and being just then in the happy leisure which followed securing the odd trick by Sir Thomas ’s capital play and her own against Dr. and Mrs. Grant ’s great hands , she called out , in high good - humour , “ Sotherton !
Fanny Price	William , you are quite out of luck ; but the next time you come , I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at home , and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly
Fanny Price	I do not exactly know the distance , but when you get back to Portsmouth , if it is not very far off , you ought to go over and pay your respects to them ; and I could send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your cousins .
Fanny Price	“ I should be very happy , aunt ; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head ; and if I could get so far , I could not expect to be welcome in such a smart place as that — poor scrubby midshipman as I am . ”
Fanny Price	Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might depend on , when she was stopped by Sir Thomas ’s saying with authority , “ I do not advise your going to Brighton , William , as I trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting ; but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere ; and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own .
Fanny Price	As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford ’s behaviour ; but when the whist - table broke up at the end of the second rubber , and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their last play , he became a looker - on at the other , he found his niece the object of attentions , or rather of professions , of a somewhat pointed character . Henry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about Thornton Lacey ; and not being able to catch Edmund ’s ear , was detailing it to his fair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness .
Fanny Price	that , in spite of all Dr. Grant ’s very great kindness , it was impossible for him and his horses to be accommodated where they now were without material inconvenience ; but his attachment to that neighbourhood did not depend upon one amusement or one season of the year : he had set his heart upon having a something there that he could come to at any time , a little homestall at his command , where all the holidays of his year might be spent , and he might find himself continuing , improving , and
Fanny Price	There was no want of respect in the young man ’s address ; and Fanny ’s reception of it was so proper and modest , so calm and uninviting , that he had nothing to censure in her .
Fanny Price	She said little , assented only here and there , and betrayed no inclination either of appropriating any part of the compliment to herself , or of strengthening his views in favour of Northamptonshire .
Fanny Price	“ I want to be your neighbour , Sir Thomas , as you have , perhaps , heard me telling Miss Price .
Fanny Price	Whatever effect Sir Thomas ’s little harangue might really produce on Mr. Crawford , it raised some awkward sensations in two of the others , two of his most attentive listeners — Miss Crawford and Fanny .
Fanny Price	One of whom , having never before understood that Thornton was so soon and so completely to be his home , was pondering with downcast eyes on what it would be _ not _ to see Edmund every day ; and the other , startled from the agreeable fancies she had been previously indulging on the strength of her brother ’s description , no longer able , in the picture she had been forming of a future Thornton , to shut out the church , sink the clergyman , and see only the respectable , elegant , modernised , and occasional residence of a man of independent fortune , was considering Sir Thomas , with decided ill - will , as the destroyer of all this , and suffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his character and manner commanded , and from not daring to relieve herself by a single attempt at throwing ridicule on his cause . All the agreeable of _ her _ speculation was over for that hour .
Fanny Price	It was time to have done with cards , if sermons prevailed ; and she was glad to find it necessary to come to a conclusion , and be able to refresh her spirits by a change of place and neighbour .
Fanny Price	William and Fanny were the most detached .
Fanny Price	Henry Crawford ’s chair was the first to be given a direction towards them , and he sat silently observing them for a few minutes ; himself , in the meanwhile , observed by Sir Thomas , who was standing in chat with Dr. Grant .
Fanny Price	“ But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth , William ? ” “ No , Fanny , that I do not .
Fanny Price	I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of dancing too , when I can not have you .
Fanny Price	You remember the Gregorys ; they are grown up amazing fine girls , but they will hardly speak to _ me _ , because Lucy is courted by a lieutenant .
Fanny Price	But never mind it , William ” ( her own cheeks in a glow of indignation as she spoke ) .
Fanny Price	“ I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant , Fanny .
Fanny Price	my dear William , do not talk so ; do not be so desponding .
Fanny Price	She was checked by the sight of her uncle much nearer to them than she had any suspicion of , and each found it necessary to talk of something else .
Fanny Price	“ Are you fond of dancing , Fanny ? ” “ Yes , very ; only I am soon tired . ” “ I should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance .
Fanny Price	Have you never any balls at Northampton ?
Fanny Price	I should like to see you dance , and I ’d dance with you if you _ would _ , for nobody would know who I was here , and I should like to be your partner once more .
Fanny Price	I am a pretty good dancer in my way , but I dare say you are a better . ”
Fanny Price	And turning to his uncle , who was now close to them , “ Is not Fanny a very good dancer , sir ? ”
Fanny Price	Fanny , in dismay at such an unprecedented question , did not know which way to look , or how to be prepared for the answer .
Fanny Price	Some very grave reproof , or at least the coldest expression of indifference , must be coming to distress her brother , and sink her to the ground .
Fanny Price	I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a little girl ; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her , which , perhaps , we may have an opportunity of doing ere long . ”
Fanny Price	“ I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance , Mr. Price , ” said Henry Crawford , leaning forward , “ and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject , to your entire satisfaction .
Fanny Price	But I believe ” ( seeing Fanny looked distressed ) “ it must be at some other time .
Fanny Price	There is _ one _ person in company who does not like to have Miss Price spoken of .
Fanny Price	True enough , he had once seen Fanny dance ; and it was equally true that he would now have answered for her gliding about with quiet , light elegance , and in admirable time ; but , in fact , he could not for the life of him recall what her dancing had been , and rather took it for granted that she had been present than remembered anything about her .
Fanny Price	He passed , however , for an admirer of her dancing ; and Sir Thomas , by no means displeased , prolonged the conversation on dancing in general , and was so well engaged in describing the balls of Antigua , and listening to what his nephew could relate of the different modes of dancing which had fallen within his observation , that he had not heard his carriage announced , and was first called to the knowledge of it by the bustle of Mrs. Norris .
Fanny Price	“ Come , Fanny , Fanny , what are you about ?
Fanny Price	Do not you see your aunt is going ?
Fanny Price	You should always remember the coachman and horses .
Fanny Price	My dear Sir Thomas , we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you , and Edmund and William . ” Sir Thomas could not dissent , as it had been his own arrangement , previously communicated to his wife and sister ; but _ that _ seemed forgotten by Mrs. Norris , who must fancy that she settled it all herself .
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s last feeling in the visit was disappointment : for the shawl which Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round her shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford ’s quicker hand , and she was obliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention .
Fanny Price	at the moment of her appearance , Frederick was listening with looks of devotion to Agatha ’s narrative , and pressing her hand to his heart ; and as soon as she could notice this , and see that , in spite of the shock of her words , he still kept his station and retained her sister ’s hand , her wounded heart swelled again with injury , and looking as red as she had been white before , she turned out of the room , saying , “ _ I _ need not be afraid of appearing before him .
Fanny Price	Her going roused the rest ; and at the same moment the two brothers stepped forward , feeling the necessity of doing something .
Fanny Price	were no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer the anxious inquiry , and , encouraging him by all means to pay his respects to Sir Thomas without delay , sent him after the others with delighted haste . Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates .
Fanny Price	She had been quite overlooked by her cousins ; and as her own opinion of her claims
Fanny Price	on Sir Thomas ’s affection was much too humble to give her any idea of classing herself with his children , she was glad to remain behind and gain a little breathing - time .
Fanny Price	Her agitation and alarm exceeded all that was endured by the rest , by the right of a disposition which not even innocence could keep from suffering .
Fanny Price	She was nearly fainting : all her former habitual dread of her uncle was returning , and with it compassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the development before him , with solicitude on Edmund ’s account indescribable .
Fanny Price	She had found a seat , where in excessive trembling she was enduring all these fearful thoughts , while the other three , no longer under any restraint , were giving vent to their feelings of vexation , lamenting over such an unlooked - for premature arrival as a most untoward event , and without mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been twice as long on his passage , or were still in Antigua . The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates , from better understanding the family , and judging more clearly of the mischief that must ensue .
Fanny Price	” Fanny was just beginning to collect herself , and to feel that if she staid longer behind it might seem disrespectful , when this point was settled , and being commissioned with the brother and sister ’s apology , saw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself to perform the dreadful duty of appearing before her uncle .
Fanny Price	Too soon did she find herself at the drawing - room door ; and after pausing a moment for what she knew would not come , for a courage which the outside of no door had ever supplied to her , she turned the lock in desperation , and the lights of the drawing - room , and all the collected family , were before her .
Fanny Price	As she entered , her own name caught her ear .
Fanny Price	Sir Thomas was at that moment looking round him , and saying , “ But where is Fanny ?
Fanny Price	Why do not I see my little Fanny?”—and on perceiving her , came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her , calling her his dear Fanny , kissing her affectionately , and observing with decided pleasure how much she was grown !
Fanny Price	Fanny knew not how to feel , nor where to look .
Fanny Price	She was quite oppressed .
Fanny Price	He had never been so kind , so _ very _ kind to her in his life .
Fanny Price	He led her nearer the light and looked at her again — inquired particularly after her health , and then , correcting himself , observed that he need not inquire ,
Fanny Price	for her appearance spoke sufficiently on that point .
Fanny Price	A fine blush having succeeded the previous paleness of her face , he was justified in his belief of her equal improvement in health and beauty .
Fanny Price	He inquired next after her family , especially William : and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little , and thinking his return a misfortune ; and when , on having courage to lift her eyes to his face , she saw that he was grown thinner , and had the burnt , fagged , worn look of fatigue and a hot climate , every tender feeling was increased , and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him .
Fanny Price	It was so agreeable to her to see him again , and hear him talk , to have her ear amused and her whole comprehension filled by his narratives , that she began particularly to feel how dreadfully she must have missed him , and how impossible it would have been for her to bear a lengthened absence .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness to her sister .
Fanny Price	Not that _ she _ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas ’s disapprobation when the present state of his house should be known , for her judgment had been so blinded that , except by the instinctive caution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth ’s pink satin cloak as her brother - in - law entered , she could hardly be said to shew any sign of alarm ; but she was vexed by the _ manner _ of his return .
Fanny Price	It had left her nothing to do .
Fanny Price	Instead of being sent for out of the room , and seeing him first , and having to spread the happy news through the house , Sir Thomas , with a very reasonable dependence , perhaps , on the nerves of his wife and children , had sought no confidant but the butler , and had been following him almost instantaneously into the drawing - room .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded of an office on which she had always depended , whether his arrival or his death were to be the thing unfolded ; and was now trying to be in a bustle without having anything to bustle about , and labouring to be important where nothing
Fanny Price	Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat , she might have gone to the housekeeper with troublesome directions , and insulted the footmen with injunctions of despatch ; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner : he would take nothing , nothing till tea came — he would rather wait for tea .
Fanny Price	Still Mrs. Norris was at intervals urging something different ; and in the most interesting moment of his passage to England , when the alarm of a French privateer was at the height , she burst through his recital with the proposal of soup .
Fanny Price	“ Sure , my dear Sir Thomas , a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea .
Fanny Price	“ Still the same anxiety for everybody ’s comfort , my dear Mrs. Norris , ” was his answer .
Fanny Price	“ Well , then , Lady Bertram , suppose you speak for tea directly ; suppose you hurry Baddeley a little ; he seems behindhand to - night . ”
Fanny Price	She carried this point , and Sir Thomas ’s narrative proceeded .
Fanny Price	His immediate communications were exhausted , and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him , now at one , now at another of the beloved circle ; but the pause was not long : in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative , and what were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say , “ How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately , Sir
Fanny Price	I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd .
Fanny Price	The first day I went over Mansfield Wood , and Edmund took the copses beyond Easton , and we brought home six brace between us , and might each have killed six times as many , but
Fanny Price	we respect your pheasants , sir , I assure you , as much as you could desire .
Fanny Price	I do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were .
Fanny Price	_ I _ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year .
Fanny Price	I hope you will take a day ’s sport there yourself , sir , soon .
Fanny Price	For the present the danger was over , and Fanny ’s sick feelings subsided ; but when tea was soon afterwards brought in , and Sir Thomas , getting up , said that he found that he could not be any longer in the house without just looking into his own dear room
Fanny Price	“ Where did you leave Miss Crawford , Fanny ? ”
Fanny Price	Fanny told of their departure , and delivered their message . “ Then poor Yates is all alone , ” cried Tom .
Fanny Price	“ I come from your theatre , ” said he composedly , as he sat down ; “ I found myself in it rather unexpectedly .
Fanny Price	Its vicinity to my own room — but in every respect , indeed , it took me by surprise , as I had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character .
Fanny Price	Not less acutely was it felt by Fanny , who had edged back her chair behind her aunt ’s end of the sofa , and , screened from notice herself , saw all that was passing before her . Such a look of reproach at Edmund from his father she could never have expected to witness ; and to feel that it was in any degree deserved was an aggravation indeed .
Fanny Price	Sir Thomas ’s look implied , “ On your judgment , Edmund , I depended ; what have you been about ? ”
Fanny Price	She knelt in spirit to her uncle , and her bosom swelled to utter , “ Oh , not to _ him _ !
Fanny Price	, he tranquilly said , “ Mr. and Miss Crawford were mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield .
Fanny Price	Do you find them agreeable acquaintance ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Mr. Crawford was a most pleasant , gentleman - like man ; his sister a sweet , pretty , elegant , lively girl . ”
Fanny Price	“ I do not say he is not gentleman - like , considering ; but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight , or he will be expecting a well - looking man . ”
Fanny Price	But at your time of life to feel all this , is a most favourable circumstance for yourself , and for everybody connected with you ; and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight .
Fanny Price	“ Perhaps , ” said Tom , “ Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now .
Fanny Price	Perhaps you may persuade _ her _ . ” “ No , she is quite determined .
Fanny Price	She certainly will not act . ”
Fanny Price	And not another word was said ; but Fanny felt herself again in danger , and her indifference to the danger was beginning to fail her already .
Fanny Price	One advantage resulted from it to Fanny : at the earnest request of Miss Crawford , Mrs. Grant had , with her usual good - humour , agreed to undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted ; and this was all that occurred to gladden _ her _ heart during the day ; and even this , when imparted by Edmund , brought a pang with it , for it was Miss
Fanny Price	Crawford to whom she was obliged — it was Miss Crawford whose kind exertions were to excite her gratitude , and whose merit in making them was spoken of with a glow of admiration .
Fanny Price	She was safe ; but peace and safety were unconnected here .
Fanny Price	Her mind had been never farther from peace .
Fanny Price	She could not feel that she had done wrong herself , but she was disquieted in every other way .
Fanny Price	Her heart and her judgment were equally against Edmund ’s decision
Fanny Price	: she could not acquit his unsteadiness , and his happiness under it made her wretched .
Fanny Price	She was full of jealousy and agitation .
Fanny Price	Everybody around her was gay and busy , prosperous and important ; each had their object of interest , their part , their dress , their favourite scene , their friends and confederates : all were finding employment in consultations and comparisons , or diversion in the playful conceits they suggested .
Fanny Price	She alone was sad and insignificant : she had no share in anything ; she might go or stay ; she might be in the midst of their noise , or retreat from it to the solitude of the East room , without being seen or missed .
Fanny Price	She could almost think anything would have been preferable to this .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Grant was of consequence : _ her _ good - nature had honourable mention ; her taste and her time were considered ; her presence was wanted ; she was sought for , and attended , and praised ; and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her the character she had accepted .
Fanny Price	But reflection brought better feelings , and shewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect , which could never have belonged to _ her _ ; and that , had she received even the greatest , she could never have been easy in joining a scheme which , considering only her uncle , she must condemn altogether .
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s heart was not absolutely the only saddened one amongst them , as she soon began to acknowledge to herself .
Fanny Price	She either sat in gloomy silence , wrapt in such gravity as nothing could subdue , no curiosity touch , no wit amuse ; or allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates , was talking with forced gaiety to him alone , and ridiculing the acting of the others .
Fanny Price	She was not pleased to see Julia excluded from the play , and sitting by disregarded ; but as it was not a matter which really involved her happiness , as Henry must be the best judge of his own , and
Fanny Price	as he did assure her , with a most persuasive smile , that neither he nor Julia had ever had a serious thought of each other , she could only renew her former caution as to the elder sister , entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there , and then gladly take her share in anything that brought cheerfulness to the young people in general , and that did so particularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her . “ I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry , ” was her observation to Mary .
Fanny Price	“ You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth .
Fanny Price	A man might represent the county with such an estate ; a man might escape a profession and represent the county . ” “ I dare say he _ will _ be in parliament soon .
Fanny Price	When Sir Thomas comes , I dare say he will be in for some borough , but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing anything yet .
Fanny Price	“ Do you remember Hawkins Browne ’s ‘ Address to Tobacco , ’ in imitation of Pope ? — Blest leaf ! whose aromatic gales dispense To Templars modesty , to Parsons sense . I will parody them — Blest Knight ! whose dictatorial looks dispense To Children affluence , to Rushworth sense .
Fanny Price	“ You will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family , I assure you .
Fanny Price	, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . ” “ I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth ’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . ” “ If you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny saw and pitied much of this in Julia ; but there was no outward fellowship between them .
Fanny Price	Julia made no communication , and Fanny took no liberties .
Fanny Price	They were two solitary sufferers , or connected only by Fanny ’s consciousness .
Fanny Price	The inattention of the two brothers and the aunt to Julia ’s discomposure , and their blindness to its true cause , must be imputed to the fullness of their own minds .
Fanny Price	“ Oh , cousin ! ” “ If you are against me , I ought to distrust myself , and yet — But it is absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way , riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act — no matter whom : the look of a gentleman is to be enough .
Fanny Price	I thought _ you _ would have entered more into Miss Crawford ’s feelings . ” “ No doubt she will be very glad .
Fanny Price	It must be a great relief to her , ” said Fanny , trying for greater warmth of manner .
Fanny Price	“ She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night .
Fanny Price	She could not finish the generous effusion .
Fanny Price	Her conscience stopt her in
Fanny Price	And now , dear Fanny , I will not interrupt you any longer .
Fanny Price	You want to be reading .
Fanny Price	But I could not be easy till I had spoken to you , and come to a decision .
Fanny Price	_ You _ , in the meanwhile , will be taking a trip into China , I suppose .
Fanny Price	“ And here are Crabbe ’s Tales , and the Idler , at hand to relieve you , if you tire of your great book .
Fanny Price	I admire your little establishment exceedingly ; and as soon as I am gone , you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting , and sit comfortably down to your table .
Fanny Price	He went ; but there was no reading , no China , no composure for Fanny .
Fanny Price	He had told her the most extraordinary , the most inconceivable , the most unwelcome news ; and she could think of nothing else .
Fanny Price	After all that she had heard him say , and seen him look , and known him to be feeling .
Fanny Price	On reaching home Fanny went immediately upstairs to deposit this unexpected acquisition , this doubtful good of a necklace , in some favourite box in the East room , which held all her smaller treasures ; but on opening the door , what was her surprise to find her cousin Edmund there writing at the table !
Fanny Price	“ Fanny , ” said he directly , leaving his seat and his pen , and meeting her with something in his hand , “ I beg your pardon for being here .
Fanny Price	I came to look for you , and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in , was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand .
Fanny Price	You will find the beginning of a note to yourself ; but I can now speak my business , which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle — a chain for William ’s cross .
Fanny Price	You ought to have had it a week ago , but there has been a delay from my brother ’s not being in town by several days so soon as I expected ; and I have only just now received it at Northampton .
Fanny Price	I hope you will like the chain itself , Fanny .
Fanny Price	I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste ; but , at any rate , I know you will be kind to my intentions , and consider it , as it really is , a token of the love of one of your oldest friends .
Fanny Price	And so saying , he was hurrying away , before Fanny , overpowered by a thousand feelings of pain and pleasure , could attempt to speak ; but quickened by one sovereign wish , she then called out , “ Oh !
Fanny Price	“ I can not attempt to thank you , ” she continued , in a very agitated manner ; “ thanks are out of the question .
Fanny Price	I feel much more than I can possibly express .
Fanny Price	Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond — ” “ If that is all you have to say , Fanny ” smiling and turning away again .
Fanny Price	I want to consult you . ”
Fanny Price	Almost unconsciously she had now undone the parcel he had just put into her hand , and seeing before her , in all the niceness of jewellers ’ packing , a plain gold chain , perfectly simple and neat , she could not help bursting forth again , “ Oh , this is beautiful indeed !
Fanny Price	This is the very thing , precisely what I wished for !
Fanny Price	This is the only ornament I have ever had a desire to possess .
Fanny Price	It will exactly suit my cross .
Fanny Price	“ My dear Fanny , you feel these things a great deal too much .
Fanny Price	I am most happy that you like the chain , and that it should be here in time for to - morrow ; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion .
Fanny Price	Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour without saying another word ; but Edmund , after waiting a moment , obliged her to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying , “ But what is it that you want to consult me about ?
Fanny Price	It was about the necklace , which she was now most earnestly longing to return , and hoped to obtain his approbation of her doing .
Fanny Price	She gave the history of her recent visit , and now her raptures might well be over ;
Fanny Price	for Edmund was so struck with the circumstance , so delighted with what Miss Crawford had done , so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct between them , that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one pleasure over his own mind , though it might have its drawback .
Fanny Price	It was some time before she could get his attention to her plan , or any answer to her demand of his opinion : he was in a reverie of fond reflection , uttering only now and then a few half - sentences of praise ; but when he did awake and understand , he was very decided in opposing what she wished .
Fanny Price	No , my dear Fanny , upon no account .
Fanny Price	“ If it had been given to me in the first instance , ” said Fanny , “ I should not have thought of returning it ; but being her brother ’s present , is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it , when it is not wanted ? ”
Fanny Price	“ No , it is not handsomer , not at all handsomer in its way , and , for my purpose , not half so fit .
Fanny Price	“ For one night , Fanny , for only one night , if it _ be _ a sacrifice ; I am sure you will , upon consideration , make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort .
Fanny Price	Miss Crawford ’s attentions to you have been — not more than you were justly entitled to — I am the last person to think that _ could _ _ be _ , but they have been invariable ; and to be returning them with what must have something the _ air _ of ingratitude , though I know it could never have the _ meaning _ , is not in your nature , I am sure .
Fanny Price	He was gone as he spoke ; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself as she could .
Fanny Price	She was one of his two dearest — that must support her .
Fanny Price	She had never heard him speak so openly before , and though it told her no more than what she had long perceived , it was a stab , for it told of his own convictions and views .
Fanny Price	It was a stab , in spite of every long - standing expectation ; and she was obliged to repeat again and again , that she was one of his two dearest , before the words gave her any sensation .
Fanny Price	Could she believe Miss Crawford to deserve him , it would be — oh , how different would it be — how far more tolerable !
Fanny Price	Till she had shed many tears over this deception , Fanny could not subdue her agitation ; and the dejection which followed could only be relieved by the influence of fervent prayers for his happiness .
Fanny Price	It was her intention , as she felt it to be her duty , to try to overcome all that was excessive , all that bordered on selfishness , in her affection for Edmund .
Fanny Price	To call or to fancy it a loss , a disappointment , would be a presumption for which she had not words strong enough to satisfy her own humility .
Fanny Price	To think of him as Miss Crawford might be justified in thinking , would in her be insanity .
Fanny Price	To her he could be nothing under any circumstances ; nothing dearer than a friend .
Fanny Price	Why did such an idea occur to her even enough to be reprobated and forbidden ?
Fanny Price	It ought not to have touched on the confines of her imagination .
Fanny Price	She would endeavour to be rational , and to deserve the right of judging of Miss Crawford ’s character , and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound intellect and an honest heart . She had all the heroism of principle , and was determined to do her duty ; but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature , let her not be much wondered at , if , after making all these good resolutions on the side of self - government , she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund had begun writing to her , as a treasure beyond all her hopes , and reading with the tenderest emotion these words , “ My very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept ” locked it up with the chain , as the dearest part of the gift .
Fanny Price	It was the only thing approaching to a letter which she had ever received from him ; she might
Fanny Price	never receive another ; it was impossible that she ever should receive another so perfectly gratifying in the occasion and the style .
Fanny Price	To her , the handwriting itself , independent of anything it may convey , is a blessedness .
Fanny Price	This specimen , written in haste as it was , had not a fault ; and there was a felicity in the flow of the first four words , in the arrangement of “ My very dear Fanny , ” which she could have looked at for ever .
Fanny Price	Having regulated her thoughts and comforted her feelings by this happy mixture of reason and weakness , she was able in due time to go down and resume her usual employments near her aunt Bertram , and pay her the usual observances without any apparent want of spirits .
Fanny Price	Thursday , predestined to hope and enjoyment , came ; and opened with more kindness to Fanny than such self - willed , unmanageable days often volunteer , for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought from Mr. Crawford to William , stating that as he found himself obliged to go to London on the morrow for a few days , he could not help trying to procure a companion ; and therefore hoped that if William could make up his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been proposed , he would accept a place in his carriage .
Fanny Price	The proposal was a very pleasant one to William himself , who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses , and such a good - humoured , agreeable friend ; and , in likening it to going up with despatches , was saying at once everything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination could suggest ; and Fanny , from a different motive , was exceedingly pleased ; for the original plan was that William should go up by the mail from Northampton the following night , which would not have allowed him an hour ’s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach ; and though this offer of Mr. Crawford ’s would rob her of many hours of his company , she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of such a journey , to think of anything else .
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s spirits lived on it half the morning , deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being himself to go away .
Fanny Price	As for the ball , so near at hand , she had too many agitations and fears to have half the enjoyment in anticipation which she ought to have had , or must have been supposed to have by the many young ladies looking forward to the same event in situations more at ease , but under circumstances of less novelty , less interest , less peculiar gratification , than would be attributed to her .
Fanny Price	Miss Price , known only by name to half the people invited , was now to make her first appearance , and must be regarded as the queen of the evening .
Fanny Price	Who could be happier than Miss Price ?
Fanny Price	But Miss Price had not been brought up to the trade of _ coming _ _ out _ ; and had she known in what light this ball was , in general , considered respecting her , it would very much have lessened her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doing wrong and being looked at .
Fanny Price	To dance without much observation or any extraordinary fatigue , to have strength and partners for about half the evening , to dance a little with Edmund , and not a great deal with Mr. Crawford , to see William enjoy himself , and be able to keep away from her aunt Norris , was the height of her ambition , and seemed to comprehend her greatest possibility of happiness .
Fanny Price	As these were the best of her hopes
Fanny Price	, they could not always prevail ; and in the course of a long morning , spent principally with her two aunts , she was often under the influence of much less sanguine views .
Fanny Price	Edmund , she had too much reason to suppose , was at the Parsonage ; and left alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris , who was cross because the housekeeper would have her own way with the supper , and whom _ she _ could not avoid though the housekeeper might , Fanny was worn down at last to think everything an evil belonging to the ball , and when sent off with a parting worry to dress , moved as languidly towards her own room , and felt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no share in it .
Fanny Price	As she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday ; it had been about the same hour that she had returned from the Parsonage , and found Edmund in the East room .
Fanny Price	“ Suppose I were to find him there again to - day ! ” said she to herself , in a fond indulgence of fancy .
Fanny Price	“ Fanny , ” said a voice at that moment near her .
Fanny Price	Starting and looking up , she saw , across the lobby she had just reached , Edmund himself , standing at the head of a different staircase .
Fanny Price	He came towards her .
Fanny Price	“ You look tired and fagged , Fanny .
Fanny Price	You have been walking too far . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , I have not been out at all . ” “ Then you have had fatigues within doors , which are worse .
Fanny Price	You had better have gone out . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny , not liking to complain , found it easiest to make no answer ; and though he looked at her with his usual kindness , she believed he had soon ceased to think of her countenance .
Fanny Price	He did not appear in spirits : something unconnected with her was probably amiss .
Fanny Price	“ You may guess my errand there , Fanny . ”
Fanny Price	And he looked so conscious , that Fanny could think but of one errand , which turned her too sick for speech .
Fanny Price	“ I wished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances , ” was the explanation that followed , and brought Fanny to life again , enabling her , as she found she was expected to speak , to utter something like an inquiry as to the result .
Fanny Price	Fanny struggled for speech , and said , “ I am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you .
Fanny Price	My uncle meant it so . ”
Fanny Price	I am only vexed for a moment .
Fanny Price	In fact , it is not that I consider the ball as ill - timed ; what does it signify ?
Fanny Price	But , Fanny , ” stopping her , by taking her hand , and speaking low and seriously , “ you know what all this means .
Fanny Price	You see how it is ; and could tell me , perhaps better than I could tell you , how and why I am vexed .
Fanny Price	Let me talk to you a little .
Fanny Price	You are a kind , kind listener .
Fanny Price	” “ The effect of education , ” said Fanny gently .
Fanny Price	They have injured the finest mind ; for sometimes , Fanny , I own to you , it does appear more than manner : it appears as if the mind itself was tainted . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment , and therefore , after a moment ’s consideration , said , “ If you only want me as a listener , cousin , I will be as useful as I can ; but I am not qualified for an adviser .
Fanny Price	Do not ask advice of _ me _ .
Fanny Price	I am not competent . ”
Fanny Price	“ You are right , Fanny , to protest against such an office , but you need not be afraid .
Fanny Price	It is a subject on which I should never ask advice ; it is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked ; and few , I imagine , do ask it , but when they want to be influenced against their conscience .
Fanny Price	I only want to talk to you . ”
Fanny Price	Excuse the liberty ; but take care _ how _ you talk to me .
Fanny Price	Do not tell me anything now , which hereafter you may be sorry for .
Fanny Price	The time may come — ” The colour rushed into her cheeks as she spoke .
Fanny Price	“ Dearest Fanny ! ” cried Edmund , pressing her hand to his lips with almost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford ’s , “ you are all considerate thought !
Fanny Price	No such time as you allude to will ever come .
Fanny Price	I begin to think it most improbable : the chances grow less and less ; and even if it should , there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of , for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples ; and if they are removed , it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had .
Fanny Price	You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said ; but you have always known my opinion of her ; you can bear me witness , Fanny , that I have never been blinded .
Fanny Price	You need not fear me ; I have almost given up
Fanny Price	every serious idea of her ; but I must be a blockhead indeed , if , whatever befell me , I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude . ” He had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen .
Fanny Price	He had said enough to give Fanny some happier feelings than she had lately known , and with a brighter look , she answered , “ Yes , cousin , I am convinced that _ you _ would be incapable of anything else , though perhaps some might not .
Fanny Price	I can not be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say .
Fanny Price	Tell me whatever you like .
Fanny Price	For Fanny ’s present comfort it was concluded , perhaps , at the happiest moment : had he been able to talk another five minutes , there is no saying that he might not have talked away all Miss Crawford ’s faults and his own despondence .
Fanny Price	She had felt nothing like it for hours .
Fanny Price	Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford ’s note to William had worn away , she had been in a state absolutely the reverse ; there had been no comfort around , no hope within her .
Fanny Price	William ’s good fortune returned again upon her mind , and seemed of greater value than at first .
Fanny Price	The ball , too — such an evening of pleasure before her !
Fanny Price	It was now a real animation ; and she began to dress for it with much of the happy flutter which belongs to a ball .
Fanny Price	All went well : she did not dislike her own looks ; and when she came to the necklaces again , her good fortune seemed complete , for upon trial the one given her by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the cross .
Fanny Price	She had , to oblige Edmund , resolved to wear it ; but it was too large for the purpose .
Fanny Price	His , therefore , must be worn ; and having , with delightful feelings , joined the chain and the cross — those memorials of the two most beloved of her heart , those dearest tokens so formed for each other by everything real and imaginary — and put them round her neck , and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were , she was able , without an effort , to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford ’s necklace too .
Fanny Price	She acknowledged it to be right .
Fanny Price	The necklace really looked very well ; and Fanny left her room at last , comfortably satisfied with herself and all about her .
Fanny Price	Her aunt Bertram had recollected her on this occasion with an unusual degree of wakefulness .
Fanny Price	It had really occurred to her , unprompted , that Fanny , preparing for a ball , might be glad of better help than the upper housemaid ’s , and when dressed herself , she actually sent her own maid to assist her ; too late , of course , to be of any use .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Chapman had just reached the attic floor , when Miss Price came out of her room completely dressed , and only civilities were necessary ; but Fanny felt her aunt ’s attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman could do themselves .
Fanny Price	Of pictures there were abundance , and some few good , but the larger part were family portraits , no longer anything to anybody but Mrs. Rushworth , who had been at great pains to learn all that the housekeeper could teach , and was now almost equally well qualified to shew the house . On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to Miss Crawford and Fanny , but there was no comparison in the willingness of their attention ; for Miss Crawford , who had seen scores of great houses , and cared for none of them , had only the appearance of civilly listening , while Fanny , to whom everything was almost as interesting as it was new , attended with unaffected earnestness to all that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in former times , its rise and grandeur , regal visits and loyal efforts , delighted to connect anything with history already known , or warm her imagination with scenes of the past .
Fanny Price	The situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect from any of the rooms ; and while Fanny and some of the others were attending Mrs. Rushworth , Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking his head at the windows .
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s imagination had prepared her for something grander than a mere spacious , oblong room , fitted up for the purpose of devotion : with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion of mahogany , and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge of the family gallery above .
Fanny Price	“ I am disappointed , ” said she , in a low voice , to Edmund .
Fanny Price	“ This is not my idea of a chapel .
Fanny Price	“ You forget , Fanny , how lately all this has been built , and for how confined a purpose , compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries .
Fanny Price	been buried , I suppose , in the parish church .
Fanny Price	you must look for the banners and the achievements . ”
Fanny Price	“ It was foolish of me not to think of all that ; but I am disappointed . ”
Fanny Price	“ This chapel was fitted up as you see it , in James the Second ’s time .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford ; and Edmund , Fanny , and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together .
Fanny Price	“ It is a pity , ” cried Fanny , “ that the custom should have been discontinued .
Fanny Price	“ _ That _ is hardly Fanny ’s idea of a family assembling , ” said Edmund .
Fanny Price	For a few moments she was unanswered .
Fanny Price	Fanny coloured and looked at Edmund , but felt too angry for speech ; and he needed a little recollection before he could say , “ Your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects .
Fanny Price	You have given us an amusing sketch , and human nature can not say it was not so .
Fanny Price	We must all feel _ at _ _ times _ the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish ; but if you are supposing it a frequent thing , that is to say , a weakness grown into a habit from neglect , what could be expected from the _ private _ devotions of such persons ?
Fanny Price	Do you think the minds which are suffered , which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel , would be more collected in a closet ? ” “ Yes , very likely .
Fanny Price	“ If Edmund were but in orders ! ” cried Julia , and running to where he stood with Miss Crawford and Fanny : “ My dear Edmund , if you were but in orders now , you might perform the ceremony directly .
Fanny Price	Fanny pitied her .
Fanny Price	Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth ; and when , after a little time , the others began to form into parties , these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund , Miss Crawford , and Fanny , who seemed as naturally to unite , and who , after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties , left them and walked on .
Fanny Price	And you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son . ”
Fanny Price	I thought _ that _ was always the lot of the youngest , where there were many to chuse before him . ” “ Do you think the church itself never chosen , then ? ” “ _ Never _ is a black word .
Fanny Price	But yes , in the _ never _ of conversation , which means _ not _ _ very _ _ often _ , I do think it .
Fanny Price	“ The _ nothing _ of conversation has its gradations , I hope , as well as the _ never _ .
Fanny Price	But I can not call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind , individually or collectively considered , temporally and eternally , which has the guardianship of religion and morals , and consequently of the manners which result from their influence .
Fanny Price	If the man who holds it is so , it is by the neglect of his duty , by foregoing its just importance , and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear . ” “ _ You _ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given , or than I can quite comprehend .
Fanny Price	“ The metropolis , I imagine , is a pretty fair sample of the rest . ”
Fanny Price	“ Not , I should hope , of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom .
Fanny Price	And with regard to their influencing public manners , Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me , or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of good - breeding , the regulators of refinement and courtesy , the masters of the ceremonies of life .
Fanny Price	The _ manners _ I speak of might rather be called _ conduct _ , perhaps , the result of good principles ; the effect , in short , of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend ; and it will , I believe , be everywhere found , that as the clergy are , or are not what they ought to be , so are the rest of the nation . ” “ Certainly , ” said Fanny , with gentle earnestness .
Fanny Price	“ There , ” cried Miss Crawford , “ you have quite convinced Miss Price already . ”
Fanny Price	“ I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too . ” “ I do not think you ever will , ” said she , with an arch smile ; “ I am just as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to take orders .
Fanny Price	You really are fit for something better .
Fanny Price	Come , do change your mind .
Fanny Price	With as much ease as I was told to go into this wilderness .
Fanny Price	“ Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two , but I forestall you ; remember , I have forestalled you . ” “ You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a _ bon _ _ mot _ , for there is not the least wit in my nature .
Fanny Price	Fanny made the first interruption by saying , “ I wonder that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood ; but the next time we come to a seat , if it is not disagreeable to you , I should be glad to sit down for a little while . ”
Fanny Price	“ My dear Fanny , ” cried Edmund , immediately drawing her arm within his , “ how thoughtless I have been !
Fanny Price	I hope you are not very tired .
Fanny Price	She took it , however , as she spoke , and the gratification of having her do so , of feeling such a connexion for the first time , made him a little forgetful of Fanny .
Fanny Price	“ But if you remember , before we left that first great path , we saw directly to the end of it .
Fanny Price	“ I am afraid you are very tired , Fanny , ” said Edmund , observing her ; “ why would not you speak sooner ?
Fanny Price	This will be a bad day ’s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up .
Fanny Price	Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon , Miss Crawford , except riding . ” “ How abominable in you , then , to let me engross her horse as I did all last week !
Fanny Price	I am ashamed of you and of myself , but it shall never happen again . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me . ”
Fanny Price	“ That she should be tired now , however , gives me no surprise ; for there is nothing in the course of one ’s duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning : seeing a great house , dawdling from one room to another , straining one ’s eyes and one ’s attention , hearing what one does not understand , admiring what one does not care for .
Fanny Price	It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world , and Miss Price has found it so , though she did not know it . ” “ I shall soon be rested , ” said Fanny ; “ to sit in the shade on a fine day , and look upon verdure , is the most perfect refreshment . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny said she was rested , and would have moved too , but this was not suffered .
Fanny Price	Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an earnestness which she could not resist , and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin ’s care , but with great regret that she was not stronger .
Fanny Price	She watched them till they had turned the corner , and listened till all sound of them had ceased .
Fanny Price	After seeing William to the last moment , Fanny walked back to the breakfast - room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy change ; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace , conceiving , perhaps , that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her tender enthusiasm , and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in William ’s plate might but divide
Fanny Price	her feelings
Fanny Price	She sat and cried _ con _ _ amore _ as her uncle intended , but it was _ con _ _ amore _ fraternal and no other .
Fanny Price	William was gone , and she now felt as if she had wasted half his visit in idle cares and selfish solicitudes unconnected with him .
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s disposition was such that she could never even think of her aunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own small house , without reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her when they had been last together ; much less could her feelings acquit her of having done and said and thought everything by William that was due to him for a whole fortnight . It was a heavy , melancholy day .
Fanny Price	Nothing remained of last night but remembrances , which she had nobody to share in .
Fanny Price	She talked to her aunt Bertram — she must talk to somebody of the ball ; but her aunt had seen so little of what had passed , and had so little curiosity , that it was heavy work .
Fanny Price	“ She could not recollect what it was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes , or what it was that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny : she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finest young man in the room — somebody had whispered something to her
Fanny Price	; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be . ” And these were her longest speeches and clearest communications : the rest was only a languid “ Yes , yes ; very well ; did you ?
Fanny Price	Fanny , you must do something to keep me awake .
Fanny Price	The cards were brought , and Fanny played at cribbage with her aunt till bedtime ; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself , no sounds were heard in the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the game—“And _ that _ makes thirty - one ; four in hand and eight in crib .
Fanny Price	You are to deal , ma’am ; shall I deal for you ? ” Fanny thought and thought again of the difference which twenty - four hours had made in that room , and all that part of the house .
Fanny Price	A good night ’s rest improved her spirits .
Fanny Price	She could think of William the next day more cheerfully ; and as the morning afforded her an opportunity of talking over Thursday night with Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford , in a very handsome style , with all the heightenings of imagination , and all the laughs of playfulness which are so essential to the shade of a departed ball , she could afterwards bring her mind without much effort into its everyday state , and easily conform to the tranquillity of the present quiet week . They were indeed a smaller party than she had ever known there for a whole day together , and _ he _ was gone on whom the comfort and cheerfulness of every family meeting and every meal chiefly depended .
Fanny Price	she was thankful that she could now sit in the same room with her uncle , hear his voice , receive his questions , and even answer them , without such wretched feelings as she had formerly known . “ We miss our two young men , ” was Sir Thomas ’s observation on both the first and second day , as they formed their very reduced circle after dinner ; and in consideration of Fanny ’s swimming eyes , nothing more was said on the first day than to drink their good health ; but on the second it led to something farther .
Fanny Price	Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm “ Yes ” ; and at the end of a quarter of an hour ’s silent consideration spontaneously observed , “ Sir Thomas , I have been thinking — and I am very glad we took Fanny
Fanny Price	Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding , “ Very true . We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face , she is now a very valuable companion .
Fanny Price	If we have been kind to _ her _ , she is now quite as necessary to _ us _ . ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , ” said Lady Bertram presently ; “ and it is a comfort to think that we shall always have _ her _ . ”
Fanny Price	Sir Thomas paused , half smiled , glanced at his niece , and then gravely replied , “ She will never leave us , I hope , till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here . ” “ And _ that _ is not very likely to be , Sir Thomas .
Fanny Price	Who should invite her ?
Fanny Price	Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her .
Fanny Price	To the young lady
Fanny Price	, at least , in each family , it brought very different feelings . What was tranquillity and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation to Mary .
Fanny Price	In some points of interest they were exactly opposed to each other . To Fanny ’s mind , Edmund ’s absence was really , in its cause and its tendency , a relief .
Fanny Price	She felt the want of his society every day , almost every hour , and was too much in want of it to derive anything but irritation from considering the object for which he went .
Fanny Price	He could not have devised anything more likely to raise his consequence than this week ’s absence , occurring as it did at the very time of her brother ’s going away , of William Price ’s going too , and completing the sort of general break - up of a party which had been so animated .
Fanny Price	She felt it keenly .
Fanny Price	Angry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions , and acting on them in defiance of her ( and she had been so angry that they had hardly parted friends at the ball ) , she could not help thinking of him continually when absent , dwelling on his merit and affection , and longing again for the almost daily meetings they lately had .
Fanny Price	He should not have planned such an absence — he should not have left home for a week , when her own departure from Mansfield was so near .
Fanny Price	Then she began to blame herself .
Fanny Price	She wished she had not spoken so warmly in their last conversation .
Fanny Price	She was afraid she had used some strong , some contemptuous expressions in speaking of the clergy , and that should not have been .
Fanny Price	She wished such words unsaid with all her heart .
Fanny Price	Her vexation did not end with the week .
Fanny Price	All this was bad , but she had still more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund ; when Saturday came and still no Edmund ; and when , through the slight communication with the other family which Sunday produced , she learned that he had actually written home to defer his return , having promised to remain some days longer with his friend . If she had felt impatience and regret before — if she had been sorry for what she said , and feared its too strong effect on him — she now felt and feared it all tenfold more .
Fanny Price	She had , moreover , to contend with one disagreeable emotion entirely new to her — jealousy .
Fanny Price	But , at any rate , his staying away at a time when , according to all preceding plans , she was to remove to London , meant something that she could not bear .
Fanny Price	Had Henry returned , as he talked of doing , at the end of three or four days , she should now have been leaving Mansfield .
Fanny Price	It became absolutely necessary for her to get to Fanny and try to learn something more .
Fanny Price	She could not live any longer in such solitary wretchedness ; and she made her way to the Park , through difficulties of walking which she had deemed unconquerable a week before , for the chance of hearing a little in addition , for the sake of at least hearing his name .
Fanny Price	The first half - hour was lost , for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together , and unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope for nothing .
Fanny Price	But at last Lady Bertram left the room , and then almost immediately Miss Crawford thus began , with a voice as well regulated as she could—“And how do _ you _ like your cousin Edmund ’s staying away so long ?
Fanny Price	Being the only young person at home , I consider _ you _ as the greatest sufferer .
Fanny Price	You must miss him .
Fanny Price	Does his staying longer surprise you ? ”
Fanny Price	“ I do not know , ” said Fanny hesitatingly .
Fanny Price	“ Yes ; I had not particularly expected it . ”
Fanny Price	He is a very — a very pleasing young man himself , and I can not help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London , as will now undoubtedly be the case .
Fanny Price	I am looking for Henry every day , and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield .
Fanny Price	I should like to have seen him once more , I confess .
Fanny Price	But you must give my compliments to him .
Fanny Price	Yes ; I think it must be compliments .
Fanny Price	Is not there a something wanted , Miss Price , in our language — a something between compliments and — and love — to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together ?
Fanny Price	Does he give you much account of what he is doing ?
Fanny Price	Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for ? ” “ I only heard a part of the letter ; it was to my uncle ; but I believe it was very short ; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines .
Fanny Price	All that I heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer , and that he had agreed to do so .
Fanny Price	; I am not quite sure which . ” “ Oh !
Fanny Price	if he wrote to his father ; but I thought it might have been to Lady Bertram or you .
Fanny Price	If he had written to you , there would have been more particulars .
Fanny Price	You would have heard of balls and parties .
Fanny Price	He would have sent you a description of everything and everybody .
Fanny Price	“ I do not at all know .
Fanny Price	I never heard .
Fanny Price	“ That is the first question , you know , ” said Miss Crawford , trying to appear gay and unconcerned , “ which every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another .
Fanny Price	“ I know nothing of the Miss Owens , ” said Fanny calmly .
Fanny Price	“ You know nothing and you care less , as people say .
Fanny Price	Well , when your cousin comes back , he will find Mansfield very quiet ; all the noisy ones gone , your brother and mine and myself .
Fanny Price	I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near .
Fanny Price	She does not like my going . ” Fanny felt obliged to speak .
Fanny Price	“ You can not doubt your being missed by many , ” said she .
Fanny Price	“ You will be very much missed . ”
Fanny Price	Miss Crawford turned her eye on her , as if wanting to hear or see more , and then laughingly said , “ Oh yes !
Fanny Price	But I am not fishing ; do n’t compliment me .
Fanny Price	If I _ am _ missed , it will appear .
Fanny Price	I may be discovered by those who want to see me .
Fanny Price	I shall not be in any doubtful , or distant , or unapproachable region . ”
Fanny Price	Now Fanny could not bring herself to speak , and Miss Crawford was disappointed ; for she had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of her power from one who she thought must know , and her spirits were clouded again .
Fanny Price	“ The Miss Owens , ” said she , soon afterwards ; “ suppose you were to have one of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey ; how should you like it ?
Fanny Price	I dare say they are trying for it .
Fanny Price	I do not at all wonder or blame them .
Fanny Price	You do n’t speak , Fanny ; Miss Price , you do n’t speak .
Fanny Price	But honestly now , do not you rather expect it than otherwise ? ” “ No , ” said Fanny stoutly , “ I do not expect it at all . ”
Fanny Price	! ” cried Miss Crawford with alacrity .
Fanny Price	“ I wonder at that .
Fanny Price	But I dare say you know exactly — I always imagine you are — perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all — or not at present . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , I do not , ” said Fanny softly , hoping she did not err either in the belief or the acknowledgment of it .
Fanny Price	Her companion looked at her keenly ; and gathering greater spirit from the blush soon produced from such a look , only said , “ He is best off as he is , ” and turned the subject .
Fanny Price	Mr. Crawford gone , Sir Thomas ’s next object was that he should be missed ; and he entertained great hope that his niece would find a blank in the loss of those attentions which at the time she had felt , or fancied , an evil .
Fanny Price	She had tasted of consequence in its most flattering form ; and he did hope that the loss of it , the sinking again into nothing , would awaken very wholesome regrets in her mind .
Fanny Price	He watched her with this idea ; but he could hardly tell with what success .
Fanny Price	He hardly knew whether there were any difference in her spirits or not .
Fanny Price	She was always so gentle and retiring that her emotions were beyond his discrimination .
Fanny Price	He did not understand her : he felt that he did not ; and therefore applied to Edmund to tell him how she stood affected on the present occasion , and whether she were more or less happy than she had been .
Fanny Price	What chiefly surprised Edmund was , that Crawford ’s sister , the friend and companion who had been so much to her , should not be more visibly regretted .
Fanny Price	He wondered that Fanny spoke so seldom of _ her _ , and had so little voluntarily to say of her concern at this separation .
Fanny Price	it was this sister , this friend and companion , who was now the chief bane of Fanny ’s comfort .
Fanny Price	If she could have believed Mary ’s future fate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother ’s should be , if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant as she was much inclined to think his , she would have been light of heart indeed ; but the more she recollected and observed , the more deeply was she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for Miss Crawford ’s marrying Edmund than it had ever been before .
Fanny Price	His objections , the scruples of his integrity , seemed all done away , nobody could tell how ; and the doubts and hesitations of her ambition were equally got over — and equally without apparent reason .
Fanny Price	His good and her bad feelings yielded to love , and such love must unite them .
Fanny Price	He was to go to town as soon as some business relative to Thornton Lacey were completed — perhaps within a fortnight ; he talked of going , he loved to talk of it ; and when once with her again , Fanny could not doubt the rest .
Fanny Price	Her acceptance must be as certain as his offer ; and yet there were bad feelings still remaining which made the prospect of it most sorrowful to her , independently , she believed , independently of self .
Fanny Price	In their very last conversation , Miss Crawford , in spite of some amiable sensations , and much personal kindness , had still been Miss Crawford ; still shewn a mind led astray and bewildered , and without any suspicion of being so ; darkened , yet fancying itself light .
Fanny Price	She might
Fanny Price	love , but she did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment .
Fanny Price	Fanny believed there was scarcely a second feeling in common between them ; and she may be forgiven by older sages for looking on the chance of Miss Crawford ’s future improvement as nearly desperate , for thinking that if Edmund ’s influence in this season of love had already done so little in clearing her judgment , and regulating her notions , his worth would be finally wasted on her even in years of matrimony . Experience might have hoped more for any young people so circumstanced , and impartiality would not have denied to Miss Crawford ’s nature that participation of the general nature of women which would lead her to adopt the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own .
Fanny Price	But as such were Fanny ’s persuasions , she suffered very much from them , and could never speak of Miss Crawford without pain . Sir Thomas , meanwhile , went on with his own hopes and his own observations , still feeling a right , by all his knowledge of human nature , to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and consequence on his niece ’s spirits , and the past attentions of the lover producing a craving for their return ; and he was soon afterwards able to account for his not yet completely and indubitably seeing all this , by the prospect of another visitor , whose approach he could allow to be quite enough to support the spirits he was watching .
Fanny Price	So the uniform remained at Portsmouth , and Edmund conjectured that before Fanny had any chance of seeing it , all its own freshness and all the freshness of its wearer ’s feelings must be worn away .
Fanny Price	So reasoned Edmund , till his father made him the confidant of a scheme which placed Fanny ’s chance of seeing the second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush in all his glory in another light .
Fanny Price	This scheme was that she should accompany her brother back to Portsmouth , and spend a little time with her own family .
Fanny Price	The thing was good in itself , and could not be done at a better time ; and he had no doubt of it being highly agreeable to Fanny .
Fanny Price	; for his prime motive in sending her away had very little to do with the propriety of her seeing her parents again , and nothing at all with any idea of making her happy .
Fanny Price	He certainly wished her to go willingly , but he as certainly wished her to be heartily sick of home before her visit ended ; and that a little abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of Mansfield Park would bring her mind into a sober state , and incline her to a juster estimate of the value of that home of greater permanence , and equal comfort , of which she had the offer .
Fanny Price	It was a medicinal project upon his niece ’s understanding , which he must consider as at present diseased .
Fanny Price	A residence of eight or nine years in the abode of wealth and plenty had a little disordered her powers of comparing and judging .
Fanny Price	Her father ’s house would , in all probability , teach her the value of a good income ; and he trusted that she would be the wiser and happier woman , all her life , for the experiment he had devised . Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures
Fanny Price	, she must have had a strong attack of them when she first understood what was intended , when her uncle first made her the offer of visiting the parents , and brothers , and sisters , from whom she had been divided almost half her life ; of returning for a couple of months to the scenes of her infancy , with William for the protector and companion of her journey , and the
Fanny Price	continuing to see William to the last hour of his remaining on land . Had she ever given way to bursts of delight
Fanny Price	, it must have been then , for she was delighted , but her happiness was of a quiet , deep , heart - swelling sort ; and though never a great talker , she was always more inclined to silence when feeling most strongly .
Fanny Price	At the moment she could only thank and accept .
Fanny Price	Afterwards , when familiarised with the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened , she could speak more largely to William and Edmund of what she felt ; but still there were emotions of tenderness that could not be clothed in words .
Fanny Price	The remembrance of all her earliest pleasures , and of what she had suffered in being torn from them , came over her with renewed strength , and it seemed as if to be at home again would heal every pain that had since grown out of the separation .
Fanny Price	To be in the centre of such a circle , loved by so many , and more loved by all than she had ever been before
Fanny Price	; to feel affection without fear or restraint ; to feel herself the equal of those who surrounded her ; to be at peace from all mention of the Crawfords , safe from every look which could be fancied a reproach on their account .
Fanny Price	Edmund , too — to be two months from _ him _ ( and perhaps she might be allowed to make her absence three ) must do her good .
Fanny Price	At a distance , unassailed by his looks or his kindness , and safe from the perpetual irritation of knowing his heart , and striving to avoid his confidence , she should be able to reason herself into a properer state ; she should be able to think of him as in London , and arranging everything there , without wretchedness .
Fanny Price	The only drawback was the doubt of her aunt Bertram ’s being comfortable without her .
Fanny Price	She was of use to no one else ; but _ there _ she might be missed to a degree that she did not like to think of ; and that part of the arrangement was , indeed , the hardest for Sir Thomas to accomplish , and what only _ he _ could have accomplished at all
Fanny Price	When he had really resolved on any measure , he could always carry it through ; and now by dint of long talking on the subject , explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny ’s sometimes seeing her family
Fanny Price	, he did induce his wife to let her go ; obtaining it rather from submission , however , than conviction , for Lady
Fanny Price	was convinced of very little more than that Sir Thomas thought Fanny ought to go , and therefore that she must .
Fanny Price	In the calmness of her own dressing - room
Fanny Price	, in the impartial flow of her own meditations , unbiased by his bewildering statements , she could not acknowledge any necessity for Fanny ’s ever going near a father and mother who had done without her so long , while she was so useful to herself .
Fanny Price	And as to the not missing her , which under Mrs. Norris ’s discussion was the point attempted to be proved , she set herself very steadily against admitting any such thing . Sir Thomas had appealed to her reason , conscience , and dignity .
Fanny Price	He called it a sacrifice , and demanded it of her goodness and self - command as such .
Fanny Price	But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade her that Fanny could be very well spared—_she _ being ready to give up all her own time to her as requested — and , in short , could not really be wanted or missed .
Fanny Price	“ That may be , sister , ” was all Lady Bertram ’s reply . “ I dare say you are very right ; but I am sure I shall miss her very much . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny wrote to offer herself ; and her mother ’s answer , though short , was so kind — a few simple lines expressed so natural and motherly a joy in the prospect of seeing her child again , as to confirm all the daughter ’s views of happiness in being with her — convincing her that she should now find a warm and affectionate friend in the “ mama ” who had certainly shewn no remarkable fondness for her formerly ; but this she could easily suppose to have been her own fault or her own fancy .
Fanny Price	She had probably alienated love by the helplessness and fretfulness of a fearful temper , or been unreasonable in wanting a larger share than any one among so many could deserve .
Fanny Price	Now , when she knew better how to be useful , and how to forbear , and when her mother could be no longer occupied by the incessant demands of a house full of little children , there would be leisure and inclination for every comfort , and they should soon be what mother and daughter ought to be to each other .
Fanny Price	William was almost as happy in the plan as his sister .
Fanny Price	It would be the greatest pleasure to him to have her there to the last moment before he sailed , and perhaps find her there still when he came in from his first cruise .
Fanny Price	And besides , he wanted her so very much to see the Thrush before she went out of harbour — the Thrush was certainly the finest sloop in the service — and there were several improvements in the dockyard , too , which he quite longed to shew her .
Fanny Price	He did not scruple to add that her being at home for a while would be a great advantage to everybody .
Fanny Price	“ I do not know how it is , ” said he ; “ but we seem to want some of your nice ways and orderliness at my father ’s .
Fanny Price	You will set things going in a better way , I am sure .
Fanny Price	You will tell my mother how it all ought to be , and you will be so useful to Susan , and you will teach Betsey , and make the boys love and mind you .
Fanny Price	By the time Mrs. Price ’s answer arrived , there remained but a very few days more to be spent at Mansfield ; and for part of one of those days the young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of their journey , for when the mode of it came to be talked of , and Mrs. Norris found that all her anxiety to save her brother - in - law ’s money was vain , and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less expensive conveyance of Fanny , they were to travel post ; when she saw Sir Thomas actually give William notes for the purpose , she was struck with the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage , and suddenly seized with a strong inclination to go with them , to go and see her poor dear sister Price .
Fanny Price	she could not help thinking her poor dear sister Price would feel it very unkind of her not to come by such an opportunity . William and Fanny were horror - struck at the idea .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Norris was left to settle the matter by herself ; and it ended , to the infinite joy of her nephew and niece , in the recollection
Fanny Price	that she could not possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present ; that she was a great deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram for her to be able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a week , and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to that of being useful to them .
Fanny Price	So her poor dear sister Price was left to all the disappointment of her missing such an opportunity , and another twenty years ’ absence , perhaps , begun . Edmund ’s plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey , this absence of Fanny ’s .
Fanny Price	He told Fanny of it .
Fanny Price	She knew so much already , that she must know everything .
Fanny Price	It made the substance of one other confidential discourse about Miss Crawford ; and Fanny was the more affected from feeling it to be the last time in which Miss Crawford ’s name would ever be mentioned between them with any remains of liberty .
Fanny Price	Once afterwards she was alluded to by him .
Fanny Price	Lady Bertram had been telling her niece in the evening to write to her soon and often , and promising to be a good correspondent herself ; and Edmund , at a convenient moment , then added in a whisper , “ And _ I _ shall write to you , Fanny , when I have anything worth writing about , anything to say that I think you will like to hear , and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter . ”
Fanny Price	Had she doubted his meaning while she listened , the glow in his face , when she looked up at him , would have been decisive .
Fanny Price	For this letter she must try to arm herself .
Fanny Price	She began to feel that she had not yet gone through all the changes of opinion and sentiment which the progress of time and variation of circumstances occasion in this world of changes .
Fanny Price	exhausted by her .
Fanny Price	though going as she did willingly and eagerly , the last evening at Mansfield Park must still be wretchedness .
Fanny Price	Her heart was completely sad at parting .
Fanny Price	She had tears for every room in the house , much more for every beloved inhabitant .
Fanny Price	She clung to her aunt , because she would miss her ; she kissed the hand of her uncle with struggling sobs , because she had displeased him ; and as for Edmund , she could neither speak , nor look , nor think , when the last moment came with
Fanny Price	it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving her the affectionate farewell of a brother . All this passed overnight , for the journey was to begin very early in the morning ; and when the small , diminished party met at breakfast , William and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage .
Fanny Price	I _ had _ my doubts at the time about her being right , for he has not even the air of a gentleman , and now I am sure she was wrong .
Fanny Price	But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him , I should never have done .
Fanny Price	It is you , only you , insensible Fanny , who can think of him with anything like indifference .
Fanny Price	But are you so insensible as you profess yourself ?
Fanny Price	No , no , I see you are not .
Fanny Price	” There was , indeed , so deep a blush over Fanny ’s face at that moment as might warrant strong suspicion in a predisposed mind .
Fanny Price	I will not tease you .
Fanny Price	But , dear Fanny , you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies .
Fanny Price	It is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject , some surmises as to what might be .
Fanny Price	You must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power .
Fanny Price	Was not he devoted to you at the ball ?
Fanny Price	you received it just as it was meant .
Fanny Price	You were as conscious as heart could desire .
Fanny Price	I remember it perfectly . ”
Fanny Price	“ Do you mean , then , that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand ?
Fanny Price	Miss Crawford , _ that _ was not fair .
Fanny Price	I am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head , but I was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes . ”
Fanny Price	“ I will not say , ” replied Fanny , “ that I was not half afraid at the time of its being so , for there was something in your look that frightened me , but not at first ; I was as unsuspicious of it at first — indeed , indeed I was .
Fanny Price	It is as true as that I sit here .
Fanny Price	And had I had an idea of it , nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace .
Fanny Price	As to your brother ’s behaviour , certainly I was sensible of a particularity : I had been sensible of it some little time , perhaps two or three weeks ; but then I considered it as meaning nothing : I put it down as simply being his way , and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me .
Fanny Price	I had not , Miss Crawford , been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn .
Fanny Price	I was quiet , but I was not blind .
Fanny Price	I could not but see that Mr. Crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing . ”
Fanny Price	I can not deny it .
Fanny Price	He has now and then been a sad flirt , and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies ’ affections .
Fanny Price	I have often scolded him for it , but it is his only fault ; and there is this to be said , that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for .
Fanny Price	And then , Fanny , the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many ; of having it in one ’s power to pay off the debts of one ’s sex !
Fanny Price	I am sure it is not in woman ’s nature to refuse such a triumph . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny shook her head .
Fanny Price	“ I can not think well of a man who sports with any woman ’s feelings ; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander - by can judge of . ”
Fanny Price	“ I do not defend him .
Fanny Price	I leave him entirely to your mercy , and when he has got you at Everingham , I do not care how much you lecture him .
Fanny Price	But this I will say , that his fault , the liking to make girls a little in love with him , is not half so dangerous to a wife ’s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself , which he has never been addicted to .
Fanny Price	And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before ; that he loves you with all his heart , and will love you as nearly for ever as possible .
Fanny Price	If any man ever loved a woman for ever , I think Henry will do as much for you . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny could not avoid a faint smile , but had nothing to say .
Fanny Price	“ I can not imagine Henry ever to have been happier , ” continued Mary presently , “ than when he had succeeded in getting your brother ’s commission . ”
Fanny Price	She had made a sure push at Fanny ’s feelings here .
Fanny Price	” Poor Fanny ’s mind was thrown into the most distressing of all its varieties .
Fanny Price	The recollection of what had been done for William was always the most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr. Crawford ; and she sat thinking deeply of it till Mary , who had been first watching her complacently , and then musing on something else , suddenly called her attention by saying : “ I should like to sit talking with you here all day , but we must not forget the ladies below , and so good - bye , my dear , my amiable , my excellent Fanny , for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast - parlour , I must take leave of you here .
Fanny Price	“ I shall see your cousin in town soon : he talks of being there tolerably soon ; and Sir Thomas , I dare say , in the course of the spring ; and your eldest cousin , and the Rushworths , and Julia , I am sure of meeting again and again , and all but you .
Fanny Price	I have two favours to ask , Fanny : one is your correspondence .
Fanny Price	You must write to me .
Fanny Price	And the other , that you will often call on Mrs. Grant , and make her amends for my being gone .
Fanny Price	” The first , at least , of these favours Fanny would rather not have been asked ; but it was impossible for her to refuse the correspondence ; it was impossible for her even not to accede to it more readily than her own judgment authorised .
Fanny Price	Her disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond treatment , and from having hitherto known so little of it , she was the more overcome by Miss Crawford ’s .
Fanny Price	Besides , there was gratitude towards her , for having made their _ tête - à - tête _ so much less painful than her fears had predicted .
Fanny Price	It was over , and she had escaped without reproaches and without detection .
Fanny Price	Her secret was still her own ; and while that was the case , she thought she could resign herself to almost everything .
Fanny Price	Henry Crawford came and sat some time with them ; and her spirits not being previously in the strongest state , her heart was softened for a while towards him , because he really seemed to feel .
Fanny Price	He was evidently oppressed , and Fanny must grieve for him , though hoping she might never see him again till he were the husband of some other woman .
Fanny Price	When it came to the moment of parting , he would take her hand , he would not be denied it ; he said nothing , however , or nothing that she heard ,
Fanny Price	and when he had left the room , she was better pleased that such a token of friendship had passed .
Fanny Price	VII “ Well , Fanny , and how do you like Miss Crawford _ now _ ?
Fanny Price	“ How did you like her yesterday ? ”
Fanny Price	I like to hear her talk .
Fanny Price	She entertains me ; and she is so extremely pretty , that I have great pleasure in looking at her .
Fanny Price	“ It is her countenance that is so attractive .
Fanny Price	She has a wonderful play of feature !
Fanny Price	But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you , Fanny , as not quite right ? ” “ Oh yes !
Fanny Price	she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did .
Fanny Price	An uncle with whom she has been living so many years , and who , whatever his faults may be , is so very fond of her brother , treating him , they say , quite like a son .
Fanny Price	“ I thought you would be struck .
Fanny Price	I do not know that her uncle has any claim to her _ gratitude _ ; his wife certainly had ; and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt ’s memory which misleads her here .
Fanny Price	She is awkwardly circumstanced .
Fanny Price	With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford , without throwing a shade on the Admiral .
Fanny Price	I do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements , though the Admiral ’s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife ; but it is natural and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely .
Fanny Price	I do not censure her _ opinions _ ; but there certainly _ is _ impropriety in making them public . ”
Fanny Price	“ Do not you think , ” said Fanny , after a little consideration , “ that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford , as her niece has been entirely brought up by her ?
Fanny Price	She can not have given her right notions of what was due to the Admiral . ”
Fanny Price	Yes , we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt ; and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under .
Fanny Price	But I think her present home must do her good .
Fanny Price	She made me almost laugh ; but I can not rate so very highly the love or good - nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters , when they are separated .
Fanny Price	I am sure William would never have used _ me _ so , under any circumstances .
Fanny Price	And what right had she to suppose that _ you _ would not write long letters when you were absent ? ” “ The right of a lively mind , Fanny , seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others ; perfectly allowable , when untinctured by ill - humour or roughness ; and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford : nothing sharp , or loud , or coarse .
Fanny Price	She is perfectly feminine , except in the instances we have been speaking of .
Fanny Price	There she can not be justified .
Fanny Price	I am glad you saw it all as I did .
Fanny Price	” Having formed her mind and gained her affections , he had a good chance of her thinking like him ; though at this period , and on this subject , there began now to be some danger of dissimilarity , for he was in a line of admiration of Miss Crawford , which might lead him where Fanny could not follow .
Fanny Price	Miss Crawford ’s attractions did not lessen .
Fanny Price	The harp arrived , and rather added to her beauty , wit , and good - humour ; for she played with the greatest obligingness , with an expression and taste which were peculiarly becoming , and there was something clever to be said at the close of every air .
Fanny Price	Edmund was at the Parsonage every day , to be indulged with his favourite instrument : one morning secured an invitation for the next ; for the lady could not be unwilling to have a listener , and every thing was soon in a fair train .
Fanny Price	A young woman , pretty , lively , with a harp as elegant as herself , and both placed near a window , cut down to the ground , and opening on a little lawn , surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer , was enough to catch any man ’s heart .
Fanny Price	Without studying the business , however , or knowing what he was about , Edmund was beginning , at the end of a week of such intercourse , to be a good deal in love ; and to the credit of the lady it may be added that , without his being a man of the world or an elder brother , without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk , he began to be agreeable to her .
Fanny Price	Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning ; she would gladly have been there too , might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed , to hear the harp ; neither could she wonder that , when the evening stroll was over , and the two families parted again , he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home , while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park ; but she thought it a very bad exchange ; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and water for her , would rather go without it than not .
Fanny Price	She was a little surprised that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford , and not see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed , and of which _ she _ was almost always reminded by a something of the same nature whenever she was in her company ; but so it was .
Fanny Price	Edmund was fond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford , but he seemed to think it enough that the Admiral had since been spared ; and she scrupled to point out her own remarks to him , lest it should appear like ill - nature .
Fanny Price	The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride , which the former caught , soon after her being settled at Mansfield , from the example of the young ladies at the Park , and which , when Edmund ’s acquaintance with her increased , led to his encouraging the wish , and the offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts , as the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish .
Fanny Price	No pain , no injury , however , was designed by him to his cousin in this offer : _ she _ was not to lose a day ’s exercise by it .
Fanny Price	The mare was only to be taken down to the Parsonage half an hour before her ride were to begin ; and Fanny , on its being first proposed , so far from feeling slighted , was almost over - powered with gratitude that he should be asking her leave for it .
Fanny Price	Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself , and no inconvenience to Fanny .
Fanny Price	returned with it in excellent time , before either Fanny or the steady old coachman , who always attended her when she rode without her cousins , were ready to set forward .
Fanny Price	Miss Crawford ’s enjoyment of riding was such that she did not know how to leave off .
Fanny Price	Active and fearless , and though rather small , strongly made , she seemed formed for a horsewoman ; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise , something was probably added in Edmund ’s attendance and instructions , and something more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in general by her early progress , to make her unwilling to dismount .
Fanny Price	Fanny was ready and waiting , and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone , and still no horse was announced , no Edmund appeared .
Fanny Price	To avoid her aunt , and look for him , she went out .
Fanny Price	The houses , though scarcely half a mile apart , were not within sight of each other ; but , by walking fifty yards from the hall door , she could look down the park , and command a view of the Parsonage and all its demesnes , gently rising beyond the village road ; and in Dr. Grant ’s meadow she immediately saw the group — Edmund and Miss Crawford both on horse - back , riding side by side , Dr. and Mrs. Grant , and Mr. Crawford , with two or three grooms , standing about and looking on .
Fanny Price	At first Miss Crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field , which was not small , at a foot ’s pace ; then , at _ her _ apparent suggestion , they rose into a canter ; and to Fanny ’s timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well she sat .
Fanny Price	Edmund was close to her ; he was speaking to her ; he was evidently directing her management of the bridle ; he had hold of her hand ; she saw it , or the imagination supplied what the eye could not reach .
Fanny Price	Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by seeing the party in the meadow disperse , and Miss Crawford still on horseback , but attended by Edmund on foot , pass through a gate into the lane , and so into the park , and make towards the spot where she stood .
Fanny Price	“ My dear Miss Price , ” said Miss Crawford , as soon as she was at all within hearing , “ I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting ; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself — I knew it was very late , and that I was behaving extremely ill ; and therefore , if you please , you must forgive me .
Fanny Price	Selfishness must always be forgiven , you know , because there is no hope of a cure . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s answer was extremely civil , and Edmund added his conviction that she could be in no hurry .
Fanny Price	“ For there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes , ” said he , “ and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner : clouds are now coming up , and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then .
Fanny Price	I wish _ you _ may not be fatigued by so much exercise .
Fanny Price	I wish you had saved yourself this walk home .
Fanny Price	Miss Price , I give way to you with a very bad grace ; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride , and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear , delightful , beautiful animal . ”
Fanny Price	The old coachman , who had been waiting about with his own horse , now joining them , Fanny was lifted on hers , and they set off across another part of the park ; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing , as she looked back , that the others were walking down the hill together to the village ; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments on Miss Crawford ’s great cleverness as a horse - woman , which he had been watching with an interest almost equal to her own .
Fanny Price	She did not seem to have a thought of fear .
Fanny Price	Very different from you , miss , when you first began , six years ago come next Easter . Lord bless you !
Fanny Price	how you did tremble when Sir Thomas first had you put on ! ”
Fanny Price	In the drawing - room Miss Crawford was also celebrated .
Fanny Price	Her merit in being gifted by Nature with strength and courage was fully appreciated by the Miss Bertrams ; her delight in riding was like their own ; her early excellence in it was like their own , and they had great pleasure in praising it .
Fanny Price	“ I was sure she would ride well , ” said Julia ; “ she has the make for it . Her figure is as neat as her brother ’s . ” “ Yes , ” added Maria , “ and her spirits are as good , and she has the same energy of character .
Fanny Price	I can not but think that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind . ”
Fanny Price	When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ride the next day .
Fanny Price	“ No , I do not know — not if you want the mare , ” was her answer .
Fanny Price	“ I do not want her at all for myself , ” said he ; “ but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home , I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time — for a whole morning , in short .
Fanny Price	She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common : Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views , and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it .
Fanny Price	She would be extremely sorry to interfere with you .
Fanny Price	It would be very wrong if she did .
Fanny Price	_ She _ rides only for pleasure ; _ you _ for health .
Fanny Price	” “ I shall not ride to - morrow , certainly , ” said Fanny ; “ I have been out very often lately , and would rather stay at home .
Fanny Price	You know I am strong enough now to walk very well . ”
Fanny Price	Edmund looked pleased , which must be Fanny ’s comfort , and the ride to Mansfield Common took place the next morning : the party included all the young people but herself , and was much enjoyed at the time , and doubly enjoyed again in the evening discussion .
Fanny Price	Edmund and Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage , and _ she _ was excluded .
Fanny Price	As Mr. Rushworth did _ not _ come , the injury was increased , and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him ; she could only be sullen to her mother , aunt , and cousin , and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert .
Fanny Price	Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing - room , fresh with the evening air , glowing and cheerful , the very reverse of what they found in the three ladies sitting there , for Maria would scarcely raise her eyes from her book , and Lady Bertram was half - asleep ; and even Mrs. Norris , discomposed by her niece ’s ill - humour , and having asked one or two questions about the dinner , which were not immediately attended to , seemed almost determined to say no more .
Fanny Price	For a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in their praise of the night and their remarks on the stars , to think beyond themselves ; but when the first pause came , Edmund , looking around , said , “ But where is Fanny ?
Fanny Price	Is she gone to bed ? ”
Fanny Price	“ No , not that I know of , ” replied Mrs. Norris ; “ she was here a moment ago . ” Her own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room , which was a very long one , told them that she was on the sofa .
Fanny Price	“ That is a very foolish trick , Fanny , to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa .
Fanny Price	Why can not you come and sit here , and employ yourself as _ we _ do ?
Fanny Price	If you have no work of your own , I can supply you from the poor basket .
Fanny Price	You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa . ” Before half this was said , Fanny was returned to her seat at the table , and had taken up her work again ; and Julia , who was in high good - humour , from the pleasures of the day , did her the justice of exclaiming , “ I must say , ma’am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . ” “ Fanny , ” said Edmund , after looking at her attentively , “ I am sure you have the headache . ” She could not deny it , but said it was not very bad . “ I can hardly believe you , ” he replied ; “ I know your looks too well .
Fanny Price	How long have you had it ? ” “ Since a little before dinner .
Fanny Price	“ Did you go out in the heat ? ”
Fanny Price	to be sure she did , ” said Mrs. Norris : “ would you have her stay within such a fine day as this ?
Fanny Price	Even your mother was out to - day for above an hour . ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , indeed , Edmund , ” added her ladyship , who had been thoroughly awakened by Mrs. Norris ’s sharp reprimand to Fanny ; “ I was out above an hour .
Fanny Price	I sat three - quarters of an hour in the flower - garden , while Fanny cut the roses ; and very pleasant it was , I assure you , but very hot .
Fanny Price	“ Fanny has been cutting roses , has she ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , and I am afraid they will be the last this year .
Fanny Price	_ She _ found it hot enough ; but they were so full - blown that one could not wait . ”
Fanny Price	“ There was no help for it , certainly , ” rejoined Mrs. Norris , in a rather softened voice ; “ but I question whether her headache might not be caught _ then _ , sister .
Fanny Price	Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar ; I always forget to have mine filled . ”
Fanny Price	“ She has got it , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time . ” “ What ! ” cried Edmund ; “ has she been walking as well as cutting roses ; walking across the hot park to your house , and doing it twice , ma’am ?
Fanny Price	No wonder her head aches . ”
Fanny Price	Mrs. Norris was talking to Julia , and did not hear .
Fanny Price	“ I was afraid it would be too much for her , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ but when the roses were gathered , your aunt wished to have them , and then you know they must be taken home
Fanny Price	“ But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice ? ”
Fanny Price	“ No ; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry ; and , unluckily , Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key , so she was obliged to go again .
Fanny Price	Edmund got up and walked about the room , saying , “ And could nobody be employed on such an errand but Fanny ?
Fanny Price	And as for Fanny ’s just stepping down to my house for me — it is not much above a quarter of a mile — I can not think I was unreasonable to ask it .
Fanny Price	” “ I wish Fanny had half your strength , ma’am . ” “ If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise , she would not be knocked up so soon .
Fanny Price	She has not been out on horseback now this long while , and I am persuaded that , when she does not ride , she ought to walk .
Fanny Price	If she had been riding before , I should not have asked it of her .
Fanny Price	But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses ; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind ; and though the sun was strong , it was not so very hot .
Fanny Price	; “ I am very much afraid she caught the headache there , for the heat was enough to kill anybody .
Fanny Price	Edmund said no more to either lady ; but going quietly to another table , on which the supper - tray yet remained , brought a glass of Madeira to Fanny , and obliged her to drink the greater part
Fanny Price	She wished to be able to decline it ; but the tears , which a variety of feelings created , made it easier to swallow than to speak .
Fanny Price	Vexed as Edmund was with his mother and aunt , he was still more angry with himself .
Fanny Price	His own forgetfulness of her was worse than anything which they had done .
Fanny Price	Nothing of this would have happened had she been properly considered ; but she had been left four days together without any choice of companions or exercise , and without any excuse for avoiding whatever her unreasonable aunts might require .
Fanny Price	He was ashamed to think that for four days together she had not had the power of riding , and very seriously resolved , however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of Miss Crawford ’s , that it should never happen again .
Fanny Price	Fanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of her arrival at the Park .
Fanny Price	The state of her spirits had probably had its share in her indisposition ; for she had been feeling neglected , and been struggling against discontent and envy for some days past .
Fanny Price	As she leant on the sofa , to which she had retreated that she might not be seen , the pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head ; and the sudden change which Edmund ’s kindness had then occasioned , made her hardly know how to support herself .
Fanny Price	Here are many that would be interested in your improvements , my dear Mr. Rushworth , and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford ’s opinion on the spot , and that might be of some small use to you with _ their _ opinions ; and , for my own part , I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again ; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss ; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth , while the rest of you walked about and settled things , and
Fanny Price	I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche , and Edmund can go on horseback , you know , sister , and Fanny will stay at home with you .
Fanny Price	Lady Bertram could think nothing less , and Fanny shared her aunt ’s security , till she received a few lines from Edmund , written purposely to give her a clearer idea of his brother ’s situation , and acquaint her with the apprehensions which he and his father had imbibed from the physician with respect to some strong hectic symptoms , which seemed to seize the frame on the departure of the fever .
Fanny Price	They judged it best that Lady Bertram should not be harassed by alarms which , it was to be hoped , would prove unfounded ; but there was no reason why Fanny should not know the truth .
Fanny Price	Fanny would certainly believe him so at least , and must find that her estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared as the attendant , supporter , cheerer of a suffering brother .
Fanny Price	There was not only the debility of recent illness to assist : there was also , as she now learnt , nerves much affected , spirits much depressed to calm and raise , and her own imagination added that there must be a mind to be properly guided . The family were not consumptive , and she was more inclined to hope than fear for her cousin , except when she thought of Miss Crawford ; but Miss Crawford gave her the idea of being the child of good luck , and to her selfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only son . Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten .
Fanny Price	A line occasionally added by Edmund to his mother ’s letter was enough for Fanny ’s information .
Fanny Price	Easter came particularly late this year , as Fanny had most sorrowfully considered , on first learning that she had no chance of leaving Portsmouth till after it .
Fanny Price	It came , and she had yet heard nothing of her return — nothing even of the going to London , which was to precede her return .
Fanny Price	Her aunt often expressed a wish for her , but there was no notice , no message from the uncle on whom all depended .
Fanny Price	She supposed he could not yet leave his son , but it was a cruel , a terrible delay to her .
Fanny Price	The end of April was coming on ; it would soon be almost three months , instead of two , that she had been absent from them all , and that her days had been passing in a state of penance , which she loved them too well to hope they would thoroughly understand ; and who could yet say when there might be leisure to think of or fetch her
Fanny Price	Her eagerness , her impatience , her longings to be with them , were such as to bring a line or two of Cowper ’s Tirocinium for ever before her .
Fanny Price	“ With what intense desire she wants her home , ” was continually on her tongue , as the truest description of a yearning which she could not suppose any schoolboy ’s bosom to feel more keenly .
Fanny Price	When she had been coming to Portsmouth , she had loved to call it her home , had been fond of saying that she was going home ; the word had been very dear to her , and so it still was , but it must be applied to Mansfield .
Fanny Price	They had been long so arranged in the indulgence of her secret meditations , and nothing was more consolatory to her than to find her aunt using the same language : “ I can not but say I much regret your being from home at this distressing time , so very trying to my
Fanny Price	I trust and hope , and sincerely wish you may never be absent from home so long again , ” were most delightful sentences to her .
Fanny Price	Still , however , it was her private regale .
Fanny Price	Delicacy to her parents made her careful not to betray such a preference of her uncle ’s house .
Fanny Price	It was always : “ When I go back into Northamptonshire , or when I return to Mansfield , I shall do so and so . ”
Fanny Price	For a great while it was so , but at last the longing grew stronger , it overthrew caution , and she found herself talking of what she should do when she went home before she was aware .
Fanny Price	She reproached herself , coloured , and looked fearfully towards her father and mother .
Fanny Price	She need not have been uneasy .
Fanny Price	There was no sign of displeasure , or even of hearing her .
Fanny Price	She was as welcome to wish herself there as to be there .
Fanny Price	It was sad to Fanny to lose all the pleasures of spring .
Fanny Price	She had not known before what pleasures she _ had _ to lose in passing March and April in a town .
Fanny Price	She had not known before how much the beginnings and progress of vegetation had delighted her .
Fanny Price	What animation , both of body and mind , she had derived from watching the advance of that season which can not , in spite of its capriciousness , be unlovely , and seeing its increasing beauties from the earliest flowers in the warmest divisions of her aunt ’s garden , to the opening of leaves of her uncle ’s plantations , and the glory of his woods .
Fanny Price	To be losing such pleasures was no trifle ; to be losing them , because she was in the midst of closeness and noise , to have confinement , bad air , bad smells , substituted for liberty , freshness , fragrance , and verdure , was infinitely worse : but even these incitements to regret were feeble , compared with what arose from the conviction of being missed by her best friends , and the longing to be useful to those who were wanting her !
Fanny Price	Could she have been at home , she might have been of service to every creature in the house .
Fanny Price	She felt that she must have been of use to all .
Fanny Price	To all she must have saved some trouble of head or hand ; and were it only in supporting the spirits of her aunt Bertram , keeping her from the evil of solitude , or the still greater evil of a restless , officious companion , too apt to be heightening danger in order to enhance her own importance , her being there would have been a general good .
Fanny Price	She loved to fancy how she could have read to her aunt , how she could have talked to her , and tried at once to make her feel the blessing of what was , and prepare her mind for what might be ; and how many walks up and down stairs she might have saved her , and how many messages she might have carried .
Fanny Price	It astonished her that Tom ’s sisters could be satisfied with remaining in London at such a time , through an illness which had now , under different degrees of danger , lasted several weeks .
Fanny Price	_ They _ might return to Mansfield when they chose ; travelling could be no difficulty to _ them _ , and she could not comprehend how both could still keep away .
Fanny Price	Fanny was disposed to think the influence of London very much at war with all respectable attachments .
Fanny Price	She saw the proof of it in Miss Crawford , as well as in her cousins
Fanny Price	; _ her _ attachment to Edmund had been respectable , the most respectable part of her character ; her friendship for herself had at least been blameless .
Fanny Price	It was so long since Fanny had had any letter from her , that she had some reason to think lightly of the friendship which had been so dwelt on .
Fanny Price	It was weeks since she had heard anything of Miss Crawford or of her other connexions in town , except through Mansfield , and she was beginning to suppose that she might never know whether Mr. Crawford had gone into Norfolk again or not till they met , and might never hear from his sister any more this spring , when the following letter was received to revive old and create some new sensations — “ Forgive me , my dear Fanny , as soon as you can , for my long silence , and behave as if you could forgive me directly .
Fanny Price	This is my modest request and expectation , for you are so good , that I depend upon being treated better than I deserve , and I write now to beg an immediate
Fanny Price	I want to know the state of things at Mansfield Park , and you , no doubt , are perfectly able to give it .
Fanny Price	One should be a brute not to feel for the distress they are in ; and from what I hear , poor Mr. Bertram has a bad chance of ultimate recovery .
Fanny Price	I thought little of his illness at first .
Fanny Price	I looked upon him as the sort of person to be made a fuss with , and to make a fuss himself in any trifling disorder , and was
Fanny Price	If it be so , I am sure you must be included in that part , that discerning part , and therefore entreat you to let me know how far I have been rightly informed .
Fanny Price	I need not say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been any mistake , but the report is so prevalent that I confess I can not help trembling .
Fanny Price	I really am quite agitated on the subject .
Fanny Price	Fanny , Fanny , I see you smile and look cunning , but , upon my honour , I never bribed a physician in my life .
Fanny Price	If he is to die , there will be _ two _ poor young men less in the world ; and with a fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one , that wealth and consequence could fall into no hands more deserving of them .
Fanny Price	With real affection , Fanny , like mine , more might be overlooked .
Fanny Price	Write to me by return of post , judge of my anxiety , and do not trifle with it .
Fanny Price	Tell me the real truth , as you have it from the fountainhead .
Fanny Price	And now , do not trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or your own .
Fanny Price	Believe me , they are not only natural , they are philanthropic and virtuous .
Fanny Price	I put it to your conscience , whether ‘ Sir Edmund ’ would not do more good with all the Bertram property than any other possible ‘ Sir . ’
Fanny Price	Had the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you , but you are now the only one I can apply to for the truth , his sisters not being within my reach .
Fanny Price	Mrs. R. has been spending the Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham ( as to be sure you know ) , and is not yet returned ; and Julia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square , but I forget their name and street .
Fanny Price	Could I immediately apply to either , however , I should still prefer you , because it strikes me that they have all along been so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up , as to shut their eyes to the truth .
Fanny Price	I suppose Mrs. R. ’s Easter holidays will not last much longer ; no doubt they are thorough holidays to her .
Fanny Price	I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down to Bath , to fetch his mother ; but how will she and the dowager agree in one house ?
Fanny Price	, so I have nothing to say from him .
Fanny Price	Do not you think Edmund would have been in town again long ago , but for this illness?—Yours ever , Mary . ”
Fanny Price	“ I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in , but he brings no intelligence to prevent my sending it .
Fanny Price	Now do not make yourself uneasy with any queer fancies because he has been spending a few days at Richmond .
Fanny Price	Be assured he cares for nobody but you .
Fanny Price	At this very moment he is wild to see you , and occupied only in contriving the means for doing so , and for making his pleasure conduce to yours .
Fanny Price	In proof , he repeats , and more eagerly , what he said at Portsmouth about our conveying you home , and I join him in it with all my soul .
Fanny Price	Dear Fanny , write directly , and tell us to come .
Fanny Price	He and I can go to the Parsonage , you know , and be no trouble to our friends at Mansfield Park .
Fanny Price	It would really be gratifying to see them all again , and a little addition of society might be of infinite use to them ; and as to yourself , you must feel yourself to be so wanted there , that you can not in conscience — conscientious as you are — keep away , when you have the means of returning .
Fanny Price	I have not time or patience to give half Henry ’s messages
Fanny Price	” Fanny ’s disgust at the greater part of this letter , with her extreme reluctance to bring the writer of it and her cousin Edmund together , would have made her ( as she felt ) incapable of judging impartially whether the concluding offer might be accepted or not .
Fanny Price	To herself , individually , it was most tempting .
Fanny Price	To be finding herself , perhaps within three days , transported to Mansfield , was an image of the greatest felicity , but it would have been a material drawback to be owing such felicity to persons in whose feelings and conduct , at the present moment , she saw so much to condemn : the sister ’s feelings , the brother ’s conduct , _ her _ cold - hearted ambition , _ his _ thoughtless vanity .
Fanny Price	She was mortified .
Fanny Price	She had thought better of him .
Fanny Price	Happily , however , she was not left to weigh and decide between opposite inclinations and doubtful notions of right ; there was no occasion to determine whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not .
Fanny Price	She had a rule to apply to , which settled everything .
Fanny Price	Her awe of her uncle , and her dread of taking a liberty with him , made it instantly plain to her what she had to do .
Fanny Price	She must absolutely decline the proposal .
Fanny Price	If he wanted , he would send for her ; and even to offer an early return was a presumption which hardly anything would have seemed to justify .
Fanny Price	She thanked Miss Crawford , but gave a decided negative .
Fanny Price	“ Her uncle , she understood , meant to fetch her ; and
Fanny Price	as her cousin ’s illness had continued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary , she must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present , and that she should be felt an encumbrance . ” Her representation of her cousin ’s state at this time was exactly according to her own belief of it , and such as she supposed would convey to the sanguine mind of her correspondent the hope of everything she was wishing for .
Fanny Price	Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman , it seemed , under certain conditions of wealth ; and this , she suspected , was all the conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate himself upon .
Fanny Price	She had only learnt to think nothing of consequence but money .
Fanny Price	His warm regard , his kind expressions , his confidential treatment , touched her strongly .
Fanny Price	It was a letter , in short , which she would not but have had for the world , and which could never be valued enough .
Fanny Price	Lady Bertram rather shone in the epistolary line , having early in her marriage , from the want of other employment , and the circumstance of Sir Thomas ’s being in Parliament , got into the way of making and keeping correspondents , and formed for herself a very creditable , common - place , amplifying style , so that a very little matter was enough for her : she could not do entirely without any ; she must have something to write about , even to her niece ; and being so soon to lose all the benefit of Dr. Grant ’s gouty symptoms and Mrs. Grant ’s morning calls , it was very hard upon her to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she could put them to .
Fanny Price	Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund ’s letter , Fanny had one from her aunt , beginning thus — “ My Dear Fanny,—I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming intelligence , which I make no doubt will give you much concern ” . This was a great deal better than to have to take up the pen to acquaint her with all the particulars of the Grants ’ intended journey , for the present intelligence was of a nature to promise occupation for the pen for many days to come , being no less than the dangerous illness of her eldest son , of which they had received notice by express a few hours before .
Fanny Price	Instead of being soon well enough to follow his friends , as he had then hoped , his disorder increased considerably , and it was not long before he thought so ill of himself as to be as ready as his physician to have a letter despatched to Mansfield . “ This distressing intelligence , as you may suppose , ” observed her ladyship , after giving the substance of it , “ has agitated us exceedingly , and we can not prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive for the poor invalid , whose state Sir Thomas fears may be very critical ; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother immediately , but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on this distressing occasion , as it would be too trying for me .
Fanny Price	We shall greatly miss Edmund in our small circle , but I trust and hope he will
Fanny Price	and I flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able to bear the removal without material inconvenience or injury .
Fanny Price	As I have little doubt of your feeling for us , my dear Fanny , under these distressing circumstances , I will write again very soon . ” Fanny ’s feelings on the occasion were indeed considerably more warm and genuine than her aunt ’s style of writing .
Fanny Price	She felt truly for them all .
Fanny Price	She could just find selfishness enough to wonder whether Edmund _ had _ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came , but no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate and disinterestedly anxious .
Fanny Price	Her aunt did not neglect her : she wrote again and again ; they were receiving frequent accounts from Edmund , and these accounts were as regularly transmitted to Fanny , in the same diffuse style , and the same medley of trusts , hopes , and fears , all following and producing each other at haphazard .
Fanny Price	Then a letter which she had been previously preparing for Fanny was finished in a different style , in the language of real feeling and alarm ; then she wrote as she might have spoken .
Fanny Price	“ He is just come , my dear Fanny , and is taken upstairs ; and I am so shocked to see him , that I do not know what to do .
Fanny Price	I am quite grieved for him , and very much frightened , and so is Sir Thomas ; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me .
Fanny Price	Without any particular affection for her eldest cousin , her tenderness of heart made her feel that she could not spare him , and the purity of her principles added yet a keener solicitude , when she considered how little useful , how little self - denying his life had ( apparently ) been . Susan was her only companion and listener on this , as on more common occasions .
Fanny Price	Susan was always ready to hear and to sympathise .
Fanny Price	Three or four Prices might have been swept away , any or all except Fanny and William , and Lady Bertram would have thought little about it ; or perhaps might have caught from Mrs. Norris ’s lips the ca nt of its being a very happy thing and a great blessing to their poor dear sister Price to have them so well provided for .
Fanny Price	Maria was her first favourite , the dearest of all ; the match had been her own contriving , as she had been wo nt with such pride of heart to feel and say , and this conclusion of it almost overpowered her . She was an altered creature , quieted , stupefied , indifferent to everything that passed .
Fanny Price	The being left with her sister and nephew , and all the house under her care , had been an advantage entirely thrown away
Fanny Price	; she had been unable to direct or dictate , or even fancy herself useful .
Fanny Price	When really touched by affliction , her active powers had been all benumbed ; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom had received from her the smallest support or attempt at support .
Fanny Price	She had done no more for them than they had done for each other .
Fanny Price	They had been all solitary , helpless , and forlorn alike ; and now the arrival of the others only established her superiority in wretchedness .
Fanny Price	Her companions were relieved , but there was no good for _ her _ .
Fanny Price	Edmund was almost as welcome to his brother as Fanny to her aunt ; but Mrs. Norris , instead of having comfort from either , was but the more irritated by the sight of the person whom , in the blindness of her anger , she could have charged as the daemon of the piece .
Fanny Price	Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not have happened .
Fanny Price	She had not spirits to notice her in more than a few repulsive looks , but she felt her as a spy , and an intruder , and an indigent niece , and everything most odious .
Fanny Price	Lady Bertram could not give her much time , or many words , but she felt her , as Fanny ’s sister , to have a claim at Mansfield , and was ready to kiss and like her ; and Susan was more than satisfied , for she came perfectly aware that nothing but ill - humour was to be expected from aunt Norris ; and was so provided with happiness , so strong in that best of blessings , an escape from many certain evils , that she could have stood against a great deal more indifference than she met with from the others . She was now left a good deal to herself , to get acquainted with the house and grounds as she could , and spent her days very happily in so doing , while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut up , or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them , at this time , for everything like comfort ; Edmund trying to bury his own feelings in exertions for the relief of his brother ’s , and Fanny
Fanny Price	devoted to her aunt Bertram , returning to every former office with more than former zeal , and thinking she could never do enough for one who seemed so much to want her .
Fanny Price	To talk over the dreadful business with Fanny , talk and lament , was all Lady Bertram ’s consolation .
Fanny Price	To be listened to and borne with , and hear the voice of kindness and sympathy in return , was everything that could be done for her .
Fanny Price	Lady Bertram did not think deeply , but , guided by Sir Thomas , she thought justly on all important points ; and she saw , therefore , in all its enormity , what had happened , and neither endeavoured herself , nor required Fanny to advise her , to think little of guilt and infamy .
Fanny Price	After a time , Fanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other subjects , and revive some interest in the usual occupations ; but whenever Lady Bertram _ was _ fixed on the event , she could see it only in one light , as comprehending the loss of a daughter , and a disgrace never to be wiped off .
Fanny Price	Fanny learnt from her all the particulars which had yet transpired .
Fanny Price	Her aunt was no very methodical narrator , but with the help of some letters to and from Sir Thomas , and what she already knew herself , and could reasonably combine , she was soon able to understand quite as much as she wished of the circumstances attending the story .
Fanny Price	His having been in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew .
Fanny Price	Mr. Rushworth had been gone at this time to Bath , to pass a few days with his mother , and bring her back to town , and Maria was with these friends without any restraint , without even Julia ; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Street two or three weeks before , on a visit to some relations of Sir Thomas ; a removal which her father and mother were now disposed to attribute to some view of convenience on Mr. Yates ’s account . Very soon after the Rushworths ’ return to Wimpole Street , Sir Thomas had received a letter from an old and most particular friend in London , who hearing and witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter , wrote to recommend Sir Thomas ’s coming to London himself , and using his influence with his daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already exposing her to unpleasant remarks , and evidently making Mr. Rushworth uneasy . Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter , without communicating its contents to any creature at Mansfield , when it was followed by another , sent express from the same friend , to break to him the almost desperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people .
Fanny Price	Sir Thomas , however , remained yet a little longer in town , in the hope of discovering and snatching her from farther vice , though all was lost on the side of character . _ His _ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of .
Fanny Price	Tom ’s complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his sister ’s conduct , and his recovery so much thrown back by it , that even Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference , and all her alarms were regularly sent off to her husband ; and Julia ’s elopement , the additional blow which had met him on his arrival in London , though its force had been deadened at the moment , must , she knew , be sorely felt . She saw that it was .
Fanny Price	Fanny felt for him most acutely .
Fanny Price	His displeasure against herself she trusted , reasoning differently from Mrs. Norris , would now be done away .
Fanny Price	_ She _ should be justified .
Fanny Price	Mr. Crawford would have fully acquitted her conduct in refusing him ; but this , though most material to herself , would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas .
Fanny Price	Her uncle ’s displeasure was terrible to her ; but what could her justification or her gratitude and attachment do for him ?
Fanny Price	She was mistaken , however , in supposing that Edmund gave his father no present pain .
Fanny Price	He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf , in addition to all the rest , when they were in town : he had seen or conjectured his feelings ; and , having reason to think that one interview with Miss Crawford had taken place , from which Edmund derived only increased distress , had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him out of town , and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt , with a view to his relief and benefit , no less than theirs .
Fanny Price	Fanny was not in the secret of her uncle ’s feelings , Sir Thomas not in the secret of Miss Crawford ’s character . Had he been privy to her conversation with his son , he would not have wished her to belong to him , though her twenty thousand pounds had been forty .
Fanny Price	That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit of a doubt with Fanny ; and yet , till she knew that he felt the same , her own conviction was insufficient .
Fanny Price	She thought he did , but she wanted to be assured of it .
Fanny Price	If he would now speak to her with the unreserve which had sometimes been too much for her before , it would be most consoling ; but _ that _ she found was not to be .
Fanny Price	She seldom saw him : never alone .
Fanny Price	He probably avoided being alone with her .
Fanny Price	Long , long would it be ere Miss Crawford ’s name passed his lips again , or she could hope for a renewal of such confidential intercourse as had been .
Fanny Price	They reached Mansfield on Thursday , and it was not till Sunday evening that Edmund began to talk to her on the subject .
Fanny Price	Sitting with her on Sunday evening — a wet Sunday evening — the very time of all others when , if a friend is at hand , the heart must be opened , and everything told ; no one else in the room , except his mother , who , after hearing an affecting sermon , had cried herself to sleep , it was impossible not to speak ; and so , with the usual beginnings , hardly to be traced as to what came first , and the usual declaration that if she would listen to him for a few minutes , he should be very brief , and certainly never tax her kindness in the same way again ; she need not fear a repetition ; it would be a subject prohibited entirely : he entered upon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the first interest to himself , to one of whose affectionate sympathy he was quite convinced .
Fanny Price	How Fanny listened , with what curiosity and concern , what pain and what delight , how the agitation of his voice was watched , and how carefully her own eyes were fixed on any object but himself , may be imagined .
Fanny Price	He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call ; and regarding it as what was meant to be the last , last interview of friendship , and investing her with all the feelings of shame and wretchedness which Crawford ’s sister ought to have known , he had gone to her in such a state of mind , so softened , so devoted , as made it for a few moments impossible to Fanny ’s fears that it should be the last .
Fanny Price	She had met him , he said , with a serious — certainly a serious — even an agitated air ; but before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence , she had introduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him .
Fanny Price	“ ‘ I heard you were in town , ’ said she ; ‘ I wanted to see you .
Fanny Price	I could not answer , but I believe my looks spoke .
Fanny Price	She felt reproved .
Fanny Price	With a graver look and voice she then added , ‘ I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister ’s expense . ’
Fanny Price	So she began , but how she went on , Fanny , is not fit , is hardly fit to be repeated to you .
Fanny Price	I can not recall all her words .
Fanny Price	She reprobated her brother ’s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for , to do what must lose him the woman he adored ; but still more the folly of poor Maria , in sacrificing such a situation , plunging into such difficulties , under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear .
Fanny Price	Guess what I must have felt .
Fanny Price	No reluctance , no horror , no feminine , shall I say , no modest loathings ?
Fanny Price	For where , Fanny , shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed ?
Fanny Price	“ I will tell you everything , and then have done for ever .
Fanny Price	She saw it only as folly , and that folly stamped only by exposure .
Fanny Price	The want of common discretion , of caution : his going down to Richmond for the whole time of her being at Twickenham ; her putting herself in the power of a servant ; it was the detection , in short — oh , Fanny ! it was the detection , not the offence , which she reprobated .
Fanny Price	It was the imprudence which had brought things to extremity , and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her .
Fanny Price	“ And what , ” said Fanny ( believing herself required to speak ) , “ what could you say ? ”
Fanny Price	She went on , began to talk of you ; yes , then she began to talk of you , regretting , as well she might , the loss of such a—.
Fanny Price	There she spoke very rationally .
Fanny Price	But she has always done justice to you .
Fanny Price	‘ He has thrown away , ’ said she , ‘ such a woman as he will never see again .
Fanny Price	She would have fixed him ; she would have made him happy for ever . ’
Fanny Price	My dearest Fanny , I am giving you , I hope , more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been — but what never can be now .
Fanny Price	You do not wish me to be silent ?
Fanny Price	If you do , give me but a look , a word , and I
Fanny Price	She spoke of you with high praise and warm affection ; yet , even here , there was alloy , a dash of evil ; for in the midst of it she could exclaim , ‘ Why would not she have him ?
Fanny Price	Could you have believed it possible ?
Fanny Price	“ Cruel ! ” said Fanny , “ quite cruel .
Fanny Price	“ Cruelty , do you call it ?
Fanny Price	I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings .
Fanny Price	The evil lies yet deeper : in her total ignorance , unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings ; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did .
Fanny Price	She was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak , as she imagined everybody else would speak .
Fanny Price	Hers are not faults of temper .
Fanny Price	She would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one , and though I may deceive myself , I can not but think that for me , for my feelings , she would—.
Fanny Price	Hers are faults of principle , Fanny ; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted , vitiated mind .
Fanny Price	Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing her , rather than have to think of her as I do .
Fanny Price	I told her so . ” “ Did you ? ” “ Yes ; when I left her I told her so . ”
Fanny Price	Well , she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them .
Fanny Price	She spoke of it , Fanny , with a steadier voice than I can . ”
Fanny Price	“ ‘ We must persuade Henry to marry her , ’ said she ; ‘ and what with honour , and the certainty of having shut himself out for ever from Fanny , I do not despair of it . Fanny he must give up .
Fanny Price	I do not think that even _ he _ could now hope to succeed with one of her stamp , and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable difficulty .
Fanny Price	My influence , which is not small shall all go that way ; and when once married , and properly supported by her own family , people of respectability as they are , she may recover her footing in society to a certain degree .
Fanny Price	In some circles , we know , she would never be admitted , but with good dinners , and large parties , there will always be those who will be glad of her acquaintance ; and there is , undoubtedly , more liberality and candour on those points than formerly .
Fanny Price	What I advise is , that your father be quiet .
Fanny Price	If by any officious exertions of his , she is induced to leave Henry ’s protection , there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him .
Fanny Price	I know how he is likely to be influenced .
Fanny Price	Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour and compassion , and it may all end well ; but if he get his daughter away , it will be destroying the chief hold . ’
Fanny Price	After repeating this , Edmund was so much affected that Fanny , watching him with silent , but most tender concern , was almost sorry that the subject had been entered on at all .
Fanny Price	At last , “ Now , Fanny , ” said he , “ I shall soon have done .
Fanny Price	I have told you the substance of all that she said .
Fanny Price	As soon as I could speak , I replied that I had not supposed it possible , coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done , that anything could occur to make me suffer more , but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence . That though I had , in the course of our acquaintance , been often sensible of some difference in our opinions , on points , too , of some moment ,
Fanny Price	it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it .
Fanny Price	That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister ( with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say ) , but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself ,
Fanny Price	giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past .
Fanny Price	That , perhaps , it was best for me ; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship , feelings , hopes which must , at any rate , have been torn from me now .
Fanny Price	And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem .
Fanny Price	This is what I said , the purport of it ; but , as you may imagine , not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you .
Fanny Price	She was astonished , exceedingly astonished — more than astonished .
Fanny Price	I saw her change countenance .
Fanny Price	She turned extremely red .
Fanny Price	I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings : a great , though short struggle ; half a wish of yielding to truths , half a sense of shame , but habit , habit carried it .
Fanny Price	She would have laughed if she could .
Fanny Price	It was a sort of laugh , as she answered , ‘ A pretty good lecture , upon my word .
Fanny Price	Was it part of your last sermon ?
Fanny Price	At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey ; and when I hear of you next , it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists , or as a missionary into foreign parts .
Fanny Price	She tried to speak carelessly ,
Fanny Price	but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear .
Fanny Price	I only said in reply , that from my heart I wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room .
Fanny Price	I had gone a few steps , Fanny , when I heard the door open behind me .
Fanny Price	‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she .
Fanny Price	I looked back .
Fanny Price	‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she , with a smile ; but it was a smile ill - suited to the conversation that had passed , a saucy playful smile , seeming to invite in order to subdue me ; at least it appeared so to me .
Fanny Price	I resisted ; it was the impulse of the moment to resist , and still walked on .
Fanny Price	I have since , sometimes , for a moment , regretted that I did not go back , but I know I was right , and such has been the end of our acquaintance .
Fanny Price	I thank you for your patience , Fanny .
Fanny Price	And such was Fanny ’s dependence on his words , that for five minutes she thought they _ had _ done .
Fanny Price	Fanny , now at liberty to speak openly , felt more than justified in adding to his knowledge of her real character , by some hint of what share his brother ’s state of health might be supposed to have in her wish for a complete reconciliation .
Fanny Price	It would have been a vast deal pleasanter to have had her more disinterested in her attachment ; but his vanity was not of a strength to fight long against reason .
Fanny Price	submitted to believe that Tom ’s illness had influenced her , only reserving for himself this consoling thought , that considering the many counteractions of opposing habits , she had certainly been _ more _ attached to him than could have been expected , and for his sake been more near doing right .
Fanny Price	Fanny thought exactly the same ; and they were also quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect , the indelible impression , which such a disappointment must make on his mind .
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s friendship was all that he had to cling to .
Fanny Price	, he allowed himself great latitude on such points . “ I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly , sister , ” said he , as he returned from attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit ; “ they are very elegant , agreeable girls . ”
Fanny Price	“ But I would not have him _ taken _ _ in _ ; I would not have him duped ; I would have it all fair and honourable . ”
Fanny Price	“ Not always in marriage , dear Mary . ”
Fanny Price	With all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married , my dear Mrs. Grant , there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry .
Fanny Price	I honour your _ esprit _ _ du _ _ corps _ .
Fanny Price	When I am a wife , I mean to be just as staunch myself ; and I wish my friends in general would be so too .
Fanny Price	It would save me many a heartache . ”
Fanny Price	She looked about her with due consideration , and found almost everything in his favour : a park , a real park , five miles round , a spacious modern - built house , so well placed and well screened as to deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen ’s seats in the kingdom , and wanting only to be completely new furnished — pleasant sisters , a quiet mother , and an agreeable man himself — with the advantage of being tied up from much gaming at present by a promise to his father , and of being Sir Thomas hereafter .
Fanny Price	It might do very well ; she believed she should accept him ; and she began accordingly to interest herself a little about the horse which he had to run at the B — — races .
Fanny Price	Much was said on his side to induce her to attend the races , and schemes were made for a large party to them , with all the eagerness of inclination , but it would only do to be talked of . And Fanny , what was _ she _ doing and thinking all this while ?
Fanny Price	and what was _ her _ opinion of the newcomers ? Few young ladies of eighteen could be less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny . In a quiet way , very little attended to , she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss Crawford ’s beauty ; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford very plain , in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the contrary , she never mentioned _ him _ .
Fanny Price	The notice , which she excited herself , was to this effect .
Fanny Price	My mother seldom goes into company herself , and dines nowhere but with Mrs. Grant , and Fanny stays at home with _ her _ . ”
Fanny Price	XXXIX Could Sir Thomas have seen all his niece ’s feelings , when she wrote her first letter to her aunt , he would not have despaired ; for though a good night ’s rest , a pleasant morning , the hope of soon seeing William again , and the comparatively quiet state of the house , from Tom and Charles being gone to school , Sam on some project of his own , and her father on his usual lounges , enabled her to express herself cheerfully on the subject of home , there were still , to her own perfect consciousness , many drawbacks suppressed .
Fanny Price	Could he have seen only half that she felt before the end of a week , he would have thought Mr. Crawford sure of her , and been delighted with his own sagacity . Before the week ended , it was all disappointment .
Fanny Price	He stepped back again to the door to say , “ Take care of Fanny , mother .
Fanny Price	She is tender , and not used to rough it like the rest of us .
Fanny Price	I charge you , take care of Fanny . ”
Fanny Price	William was gone : and the home he had left her in was , Fanny could not conceal it from herself , in almost every respect the very reverse of what she could have wished .
Fanny Price	She could not respect her parents as she had hoped .
Fanny Price	On her father , her confidence had not been sanguine , but he was more negligent of his family , his habits were worse , and his manners coarser , than she had been prepared for .
Fanny Price	She had never been able to recall anything approaching to tenderness in his former treatment of herself .
Fanny Price	There had remained only a general impression of roughness and loudness ; and now he scarcely ever noticed her , but to make her the object of a coarse joke .
Fanny Price	Her disappointment in her mother was greater : _ there _ she had hoped much , and found almost nothing .
Fanny Price	Every flattering scheme of being of consequence to her soon fell to the ground .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Price was not unkind ; but , instead of gaining on her affection and confidence , and becoming more and more dear , her daughter never met with greater kindness from her than on the first day of her arrival .
Fanny Price	Her heart and her time were already quite full ; she had neither leisure nor affection to bestow on Fanny .
Fanny Price	Of her two sisters , Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram than Mrs. Norris .
Fanny Price	She was a manager by necessity , without any of Mrs. Norris ’s inclination for it , or any of her activity .
Fanny Price	Her disposition was naturally easy and indolent , like Lady Bertram ’s ; and a situation of similar affluence and do - nothingness would have been much more suited to her capacity than the exertions and self - denials of the one which her imprudent marriage had placed her in .
Fanny Price	She
Fanny Price	have made just as good a woman of consequence as Lady Bertram , but Mrs. Norris
Fanny Price	would have been a more respectable mother of nine children on a small income . Much of all this Fanny could not but be sensible of .
Fanny Price	She might scruple to make use of the words , but she must and did feel that her mother was a partial , ill - judging parent , a dawdle , a slattern , who neither taught nor restrained her children , whose house was the scene of mismanagement and discomfort from beginning to end , and who had no talent , no conversation , no affection towards herself ; no curiosity to know her better , no desire of her friendship , and no inclination for her company that could lessen her sense of such feelings .
Fanny Price	Fanny was very anxious to be useful , and not to appear above her home , or in any way disqualified or disinclined , by her foreign education , from contributing her help to its comforts , and therefore set about working for Sam immediately ; and by working early and late , with perseverance and great despatch , did so much that the boy was shipped off at last , with more than half his linen ready .
Fanny Price	She had great pleasure in feeling her usefulness , but could not conceive how they would have managed without her .
Fanny Price	Sam , loud and overbearing as he was , she rather regretted when he went , for he was clever and intelligent , and glad to be employed in any errand in the town ; and though spurning the remonstrances of Susan , given as they were , though very reasonable in themselves , with ill - timed and powerless warmth , was beginning to be influenced by
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s services and gentle persuasions
Fanny Price	she found that the best of the three younger ones was gone in him : Tom and Charles being at least as many years as they were his juniors distant from that age of feeling and reason , which might suggest the expediency of making friends , and of endeavouring to be less disagreeable .
Fanny Price	Their sister soon despaired of making the smallest impression on _ them _ ; they were quite untameable by any means of address which she had spirits or time to attempt .
Fanny Price	Every afternoon brought a return of their riotous games all over the house ; and she very early learned to sigh at the approach of Saturday ’s constant half - holiday .
Fanny Price	Betsey , too , a spoiled child , trained up to think the alphabet her greatest enemy , left to be with the servants at her pleasure , and then encouraged to report any evil of them , she was almost as ready to despair of being able to love or assist ; and of Susan ’s temper she had many doubts .
Fanny Price	Her continual disagreements with her mother , her rash squabbles with Tom and Charles , and petulance with Betsey , were at least so distressing to Fanny that , though admitting they were by no means without provocation , she feared the disposition that could push them to such length must be far from amiable , and from affording any repose to herself .
Fanny Price	Such was the home which was to put Mansfield out of her head , and teach her to think of her cousin Edmund with moderated feelings .
Fanny Price	The living in incessant noise was , to a frame and temper delicate and nervous like Fanny ’s , an evil which no superadded elegance or harmony could have entirely atoned for .
Fanny Price	If tenderness could be ever supposed wanting , good sense and good breeding supplied its place ; and as to the little irritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris , they were short , they were trifling , they were as a drop of water to the ocean , compared with the ceaseless tumult of her present abode .
Fanny Price	everybody was noisy , every voice was loud ( excepting , perhaps , her mother ’s , which resembled the soft monotony of Lady Bertram ’s , only worn into fretfulness ) .
Fanny Price	The doors were in constant banging , the stairs were never at rest , nothing was done without a clatter , nobody sat still , and nobody could command attention when they spoke . In a review of the two houses , as they appeared to her before the end of a week , Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson ’s celebrated judgment as to matrimony and celibacy , and say , that though Mansfield Park might have some pains , Portsmouth could have no pleasures .
Fanny Price	Susan , you should have taken care of the fire .
Fanny Price	” “ I was upstairs , mama , moving my things , ” said Susan , in a fearless , self - defending tone , which startled Fanny .
Fanny Price	“ You know you had but just settled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room ; and I could not get Rebecca to give me any help .
Fanny Price	Farther discussion was prevented by various bustles : first , the driver came to be paid ; then there was a squabble between Sam and Rebecca about the manner of carrying up his sister ’s trunk , which he would manage all his own way ; and lastly , in walked Mr. Price himself , his own loud voice preceding him , as with something of the oath kind he kicked away his son ’s portmanteau and his daughter ’s bandbox in the passage , and called out for a candle ; no candle was brought , however , and he walked into the room .
Fanny Price	Fanny with doubting feelings had risen to meet him , but sank down again on finding herself undistinguished in the dusk , and unthought of .
Fanny Price	I would not have been out of the way for a thousand pounds .
Fanny Price	Old Scholey ran in at breakfast - time , to say she had slipped her moorings and was coming out , I jumped up , and made but two steps to the platform .
Fanny Price	I was upon the platform two hours this afternoon looking at her .
Fanny Price	But here is my sister , sir ; here is Fanny , ” turning and leading her forward ; “ it is so dark you do not see her .
Fanny Price	With an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her , Mr. Price now received his daughter ; and having given her a cordial hug , and observed that she was grown into a woman , and he supposed would be wanting a husband soon , seemed very much inclined to forget her again .
Fanny Price	Fanny shrunk back to her seat , with feelings sadly pained by his language and his smell of spirits ; and he talked on only to his son , and only of the Thrush , though William , warmly interested as he was in that subject , more than once tried to make his father think of Fanny , and her long absence and long journey . After sitting some time longer , a candle was obtained ; but as there was still no appearance of tea , nor , from Betsey ’s reports from the kitchen , much hope of any under a considerable period , William determined to go and change his dress , and make the necessary preparations for his removal on board directly , that he might have his tea in comfort afterwards .
Fanny Price	Charles had been born since Fanny ’s going away , but Tom she had often helped to nurse , and now felt a particular pleasure in seeing again .
Fanny Price	She had now seen all that were at home ; there remained only two brothers between herself and Susan , one of whom was a clerk in a public office in London , and the other midshipman on board an Indiaman .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Price , Rebecca , and Betsey all went up to defend themselves , all talking together , but Rebecca loudest , and the job was to be done as well as it could in a great hurry ; William trying in vain to send Betsey down again , or keep her from being troublesome where she was ; the whole of which , as almost every door in the house was open , could be plainly distinguished in the parlour , except when drowned at intervals by the superior noise of Sam , Tom , and Charles chasing each other up and down stairs , and tumbling about and hallooing . Fanny was almost stunned .
Fanny Price	brought everything so close to her , that , added to the fatigue of her journey , and all her recent agitation , she hardly knew how to bear it .
Fanny Price	_ Within _ the room all was tranquil enough , for Susan having disappeared with the others , there were soon only her father and herself remaining ; and he , taking out a newspaper , the accustomary loan of a neighbour , applied himself to studying it , without seeming to recollect her existence .
Fanny Price	The solitary candle was held between himself and the paper , without any reference to her possible convenience ; but she had nothing to do , and was glad to have the light screened from her aching head , as she sat in bewildered , broken , sorrowful contemplation .
Fanny Price	She was at home .
Fanny Price	it was not such a home , she had not such a welcome , as — she checked herself ; she was unreasonable .
Fanny Price	This threat was so palpably disregarded , that though within five minutes afterwards the three boys all burst into the room together and sat down , Fanny could not consider it as a proof of anything more than their being for the time thoroughly fagged , which their hot faces and panting breaths seemed to prove , especially as they were still kicking each other ’s shins , and hallooing out at sudden starts immediately under their father ’s eye .
Fanny Price	The next opening of the door brought something more welcome : it was for the tea - things , which she had begun almost to despair of seeing that evening .
Fanny Price	Susan and an attendant girl , whose inferior appearance informed Fanny , to her great surprise , that she had previously seen the upper servant , brought in everything necessary for the meal ; Susan looking , as she put the kettle on the fire and glanced at her sister , as if divided between the agreeable triumph of shewing her activity and usefulness , and the dread of being thought to demean herself by such an office . “ She had been into the kitchen , ” she said , “ to hurry Sally and help make the toast , and spread the bread and butter , or she did not know when they should have got tea , and she was sure her sister must want something after her journey .
Fanny Price	Fanny was very thankful .
Fanny Price	She could not but own that she should be very glad of a little tea , and Susan immediately set about making it , as if pleased to have the employment all to herself ; and with only a little unnecessary bustle , and some few injudicious attempts at keeping her brothers in better order than she could
Fanny Price	, acquitted herself very well .
Fanny Price	Fanny ’s spirit was as much refreshed as her body ; her head and heart were soon the better for such well - timed kindness .
Fanny Price	Susan had an open , sensible countenance ; she was like William , and Fanny hoped to find her like him in disposition and goodwill towards herself .
Fanny Price	He , complete in his lieutenant ’s uniform , looking and moving all the taller , firmer , and more graceful for it , and with the happiest smile over his face , walked up directly to Fanny , who , rising from her seat , looked at him for a moment in speechless admiration , and then threw her arms round his neck to sob out her various emotions of pain and pleasure .
Fanny Price	Anxious not to appear unhappy , she soon recovered herself ; and wiping away her tears , was able to notice and admire all the striking parts of his dress ; listening with reviving spirits to his cheerful hopes of being on shore some part of every day before they sailed , and even of getting her to Spithead to see the sloop .
Fanny Price	Something like tranquillity might now be hoped for ; and accordingly , when Rebecca had been prevailed on to carry away the tea - things , and Mrs. Price had walked about the room some time looking for a shirt - sleeve , which Betsey at last hunted out from a drawer in the kitchen , the small party of females were pretty well composed , and the mother having lamented again over the impossibility of getting Sam ready in time , was at leisure to think of her eldest daughter and the friends she had come from .
Fanny Price	The Bertrams were all forgotten in detailing the faults of Rebecca , against whom Susan had also much to depose , and little Betsey a great deal more , and who did seem so thoroughly without a single recommendation , that Fanny could not help
Fanny Price	modestly presuming that her mother meant to part with her when her year was up
Fanny Price	Servants are come to such a pass , my dear , in Portsmouth , that it is quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year .
Fanny Price	” Fanny was silent ; but not from being convinced that there might not be a remedy found for some of these evils .
Fanny Price	As she now sat looking at Betsey
Fanny Price	, she could not but think particularly of another sister , a very pretty little girl , whom she had left there not much younger when she went into Northamptonshire , who had died a few years afterwards .
Fanny Price	Fanny in those early days had preferred her to Susan ; and when the news of her death had at last reached Mansfield , had for a short time been quite afflicted .
Fanny Price	The sight of Betsey brought the image of little Mary back again , but she would not have pained her mother by alluding to her for the world .
Fanny Price	While considering her with these ideas , Betsey , at a small distance , was holding out something to catch her eyes , meaning to screen it at the same time from Susan ’s . “ What have you got there , my love ? ” said Fanny ; “ come and shew it to me . ”
Fanny Price	Up jumped Susan , claiming it as her own , and trying to get it away ; but the child ran to her mother ’s protection ,
Fanny Price	and Susan could only reproach , which she did very warmly , and evidently hoping to interest Fanny on her side .
Fanny Price	” Fanny was quite shocked .
Fanny Price	Every feeling of duty , honour , and tenderness was wounded by her sister ’s speech and her mother ’s reply .
Fanny Price	“ Now , Susan , ” cried Mrs. Price , in a complaining voice , “ now , how can you be so cross ?
Fanny Price	You are always quarrelling about that knife .
Fanny Price	I wish you would not be so quarrelsome .
Fanny Price	Poor little Betsey ; how cross Susan is to you !
Fanny Price	But you should not have taken it out , my dear , when I sent you to the drawer .
Fanny Price	You know I told you not to touch it , because Susan is so cross about it .
Fanny Price	she was so fond of it , Fanny , that she would have it lay by her in bed , all through her illness .
Fanny Price	My own Betsey ” ( fondling her ) , “ _ you _ have not the luck of such a good godmother .
Fanny Price	Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little people as you .
Fanny Price	Fanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris , but a message to say she hoped that her god - daughter was a good girl , and learnt her book .
Fanny Price	There had been at one moment a slight murmur in the drawing - room at Mansfield Park about sending her a prayer - book ; but no second sound had been heard of such a purpose .
Fanny Price	Mrs. Norris , however , had gone home and taken down two old prayer - books of her husband with that idea ; but , upon examination , the ardour of generosity went off .
Fanny Price	One was found to have too small a print for a child ’s eyes , and the other to be too cumbersome for her to carry about .
Fanny Price	Fanny , fatigued and fatigued again , was thankful to accept the first invitation of going to bed ; and before Betsey had finished her cry at being allowed to sit up only one hour extraordinary in honour of sister , she was off , leaving all below in confusion and noise again ; the boys begging for toasted cheese , her father calling out for his rum and water , and Rebecca never where she ought to be .
Fanny Price	There was nothing to raise her spirits in the confined and scantily furnished chamber that she was to share with Susan .
Fanny Price	Henry , overjoyed to have her go , bowed and watched her off , and without losing another moment , turned instantly to Fanny , and , taking out some letters , said , with a most animated look , “ I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone : I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea . Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are , I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring .
Fanny Price	Your brother is a lieutenant .
Fanny Price	I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother ’s promotion .
Fanny Price	You will , perhaps , like to see them .
Fanny Price	Fanny could not speak , but he did not want her to speak .
Fanny Price	To see the expression of her eyes , the change of her complexion , the progress of her feelings , their doubt , confusion , and felicity , was enough .
Fanny Price	She took the letters as he gave them .
Fanny Price	The first was from the Admiral to inform his nephew , in a few words , of his having succeeded in the object he had undertaken , the promotion of young Price , and enclosing two more , one from the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend , whom the Admiral had set to work in the business , the other from that friend to himself , by which it appeared that his lordship had the very great happiness of attending to the recommendation of Sir Charles ; that Sir Charles was much delighted in having such an opportunity of proving his regard for Admiral Crawford , and that the circumstance of Mr. William Price ’s commission as Second Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made out was spreading general joy through a wide circle of great people .
Fanny Price	I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of a friend , as this day _ does _ prove it .
Fanny Price	I may say that even I could not require William Price to excite a greater interest , or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation , than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together .
Fanny Price	” “ Has this been all _ your _ doing , then ? ” cried Fanny .
Fanny Price	how very , very kind ! Have you really — was it by _ your _ desire ?
Fanny Price	I beg your pardon , but I am bewildered .
Fanny Price	I am stupefied .
Fanny Price	His last journey to London had been undertaken with no other view than that of introducing her brother in Hill Street , and prevailing on the Admiral to exert whatever interest he might have for getting him on .
Fanny Price	, he could not have borne any participation of his feelings , but this had been his business ; and he spoke with such a glow of what his solicitude had been , and used such strong expressions , was so abounding in the _ deepest _ _ interest _ , in _ twofold _ _ motives _ , in _ views _ _ and _ _ wishes _ _ more _ _ than _ _ could _ _ be _ _ told _ , that Fanny could not have remained insensible of his drift , had she been able to attend ; but her heart was so full and her senses still so astonished , that she could listen but imperfectly even to what he told her of William , and saying only when he paused , “ How kind ! how very kind !
Fanny Price	She jumped up and moved in haste towards the door , crying out , “ I will go to my uncle .
Fanny Price	My uncle ought to know it as soon as possible . ”
Fanny Price	He was after her immediately .
Fanny Price	“ She must not go , she must allow him five minutes longer , ” and he took her hand and led her back to her seat , and was in the middle of his farther explanation , before she had suspected for what she was detained .
Fanny Price	When she did understand it , however , and found herself expected to believe that she had created sensations which his heart had never known before , and that everything he had done for William was to be placed to the account of his excessive and unequalled attachment to her , she was exceedingly distressed , and for some moments unable to speak .
Fanny Price	She considered it all as nonsense , as mere trifling and gallantry , which meant only to deceive for the hour ; she could not but feel that it was treating her improperly and unworthily , and in such a way as she had not deserved ; but it was like himself , and entirely of a piece with what she had seen before ; and she would not allow herself to shew half the displeasure she felt , because he had been conferring an obligation , which no want of delicacy on his part could make a trifle to her .
Fanny Price	While her heart was still bounding with joy and gratitude on William ’s behalf , she could not be severely resentful of anything that injured only herself ; and after having twice drawn back her hand , and twice attempted in vain to turn away from him , she got up , and said only , with much agitation , “ Do n’t , Mr. Crawford , pray do n’t !
Fanny Price	I beg you would not .
Fanny Price	This is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me .
Fanny Price	I must go away .
Fanny Price	I can not bear it . ”
Fanny Price	But he was still talking on , describing his affection , soliciting a return , and , finally , in words so plain as to bear but one meaning even to her , offering himself , hand , fortune , everything , to her acceptance .
Fanny Price	Her astonishment and confusion increased ; and though still not knowing how to suppose him serious , she could hardly stand .
Fanny Price	“ No , no , no ! ” she cried , hiding her face .
Fanny Price	Do not distress me .
Fanny Price	I can hear no more of this .
Fanny Price	Your kindness to William makes me more obliged to you than words can express ; but I do not want , I can not bear , I must not listen to such — No , no , do n’t think of me .
Fanny Price	But you are _ not _ thinking of me .
Fanny Price	I know it is all nothing .
Fanny Price	She had burst away from him , and at that moment Sir Thomas was heard speaking to a servant in his way towards the room they were in .
Fanny Price	It was no time for farther assurances or entreaty , though to part with her at a moment when her modesty alone seemed , to his sanguine and preassured mind , to stand in the way of the happiness he sought , was a cruel necessity .
Fanny Price	She rushed out at an opposite door from the one her uncle was approaching , and was walking up and down the East room in the utmost confusion of contrary feeling , before Sir Thomas ’s politeness or apologies were over , or he had reached the beginning of the joyful intelligence which his visitor came to communicate .
Fanny Price	She was feeling , thinking , trembling about everything ; agitated , happy , miserable , infinitely obliged , absolutely angry .
Fanny Price	He had previously made her the happiest of human beings , and now he had insulted — she knew not what to say , how to class , or how to regard it .
Fanny Price	She would not have him be serious , and yet what could excuse the use of such words and offers , if they meant but to trifle ?
Fanny Price	She would think of it for ever and forget all the rest .
Fanny Price	Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her so again : he must have seen how unwelcome it was to her ; and in that case , how gratefully she could esteem him for his friendship to William !
Fanny Price	She would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the great staircase , till she had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford ’s having left the house ; but when convinced of his being gone , she was eager to go down and be with her uncle , and have all the happiness of his joy as well as her own , and all the benefit of his information or his conjectures as to what would now be William ’s destination .
Fanny Price	Thomas was as joyful as she could desire , and very kind and communicative ; and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William as to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her , till she found , towards the close , that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and dine there that very day .
Fanny Price	This was a most unwelcome hearing , for though he might think nothing of what had passed , it would be quite distressing to her to see him again so soon .
Fanny Price	She tried to get the better of it ; tried very hard , as the dinner hour approached , to feel and appear as usual ; but it was quite impossible for her not to look most shy and uncomfortable when their visitor entered the room .
Fanny Price	She could not have supposed it in the power of any concurrence of circumstances to give her so many painful sensations on the first day of hearing of William ’s promotion .
Fanny Price	Mr. Crawford was not only in the room — he was soon close to her .
Fanny Price	Fanny could not look at him , but there was no consciousness of past folly in his voice .
Fanny Price	She opened her note immediately , glad to have anything to do , and happy , as she read it , to feel that the fidgetings of her aunt Norris , who was also to dine there , screened her a little from view .
Fanny Price	“ MY DEAR FANNY,—for so I may now always call you , to the infinite relief of a tongue that has been stumbling at _ Miss _ _ Price _ for at least the last six weeks — I can not let my brother go without sending you a few lines of general congratulation , and giving my most joyful consent and approval .
Fanny Price	Go on , my dear Fanny , and without fear ; there can be no difficulties worth naming .
Fanny Price	I chuse to suppose that the assurance of my consent will be something ; so you may smile upon him with your sweetest smiles this afternoon , and send him back to me even happier than he goes .
Fanny Price	Yours affectionately , M. C.
Fanny Price	” These were not expressions to do Fanny any good ; for though she read in too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss Crawford ’s meaning , it was evident that she meant to compliment her on her brother ’s attachment , and even to _ appear _ to believe it serious .
Fanny Price	She did not know what to do , or what to think .
Fanny Price	She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her , and he spoke to her much too often ; and she was afraid there was a something in his voice and manner in addressing her very different from what they were when he talked to the others .
Fanny Price	Her comfort in that day ’s dinner was quite destroyed : she could hardly eat anything ; and when Sir Thomas good - humouredly observed that joy had taken away her appetite
Fanny Price	, she was ready to sink with shame , from the dread of Mr. Crawford ’s interpretation ; for though nothing could have tempted her to turn her eyes to the right hand , where he sat , she felt that _ his _ were immediately directed towards her .
Fanny Price	She was more silent than ever .
Fanny Price	She would hardly join even when William was the subject , for his commission came all from the right hand too , and there was pain in the connexion .
Fanny Price	She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever , and began to be in despair of ever getting away ; but at last they were in the drawing - room , and she was able to think as she would , while her aunts finished the subject of William ’s appointment in their own style .
Fanny Price	Fanny , William must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies ; and I shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having .
Fanny Price	I think I will have two shawls , Fanny . ”
Fanny Price	Fanny , meanwhile , speaking only when she could not help it , was very earnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss Crawford were at .
Fanny Price	Everything natural , probable , reasonable , was against it ; all their habits and ways of thinking , and all her own demerits .
Fanny Price	How could _ she _ have excited serious attachment in a man who had seen so many , and been admired by so many , and flirted with so many , infinitely her superiors ; who seemed so little open to serious impressions , even where pains had been taken to please him ; who thought so slightly , so carelessly , so unfeelingly on all such points ; who was everything to everybody , and seemed to find no one essential to him ? And farther , how could it be supposed that his sister , with all her high and worldly notions of matrimony , would be forwarding anything of a serious nature in such a quarter ?
Fanny Price	Fanny was ashamed of her own doubts .
Fanny Price	Everything might be possible rather than serious attachment , or serious approbation of it toward her .
Fanny Price	She had quite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas and Mr. Crawford joined them .
Fanny Price	; for once or twice a look seemed forced on her which she did not know how to class among the common meaning ; in any other man , at least , she would have said that it meant something very earnest , very pointed .
Fanny Price	But she still tried to believe it no more than what he might often have expressed towards her cousins and fifty other women .
Fanny Price	She thought he was wishing to speak to her unheard by the rest .
Fanny Price	She fancied he was trying for it the whole evening at intervals , whenever Sir Thomas was out of the room , or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris , and she carefully refused him every opportunity .
Fanny Price	At last — it seemed an at last to Fanny ’s nervousness , though not remarkably late — he began to talk of going away ; but the comfort of the sound was impaired by his turning to her the next moment , and saying , “ Have you nothing to send to Mary ?
Fanny Price	She will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you .
Fanny Price	certainly , ” cried Fanny , rising in haste , the haste of embarrassment and of wanting to get away—“I will write directly . ”
Fanny Price	She went accordingly to the table , where she was in the habit of writing for her aunt , and prepared her materials without knowing what in the world to say .
Fanny Price	She had read Miss Crawford ’s note only once , and how to reply to anything so imperfectly understood was most distressing .
Fanny Price	Quite unpractised in such sort of note - writing , had there been time for scruples and fears as to style she would have felt them in abundance : but something must be instantly written ; and with only one decided feeling , that of wishing not to appear to think anything really intended , she wrote thus , in great trembling both of spirits and hand — “ I am very much obliged to you , my dear Miss Crawford , for your kind congratulations , as far as they relate to my dearest William .
Fanny Price	The rest of your note I know means nothing ; but I am so unequal to anything of the sort , that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice .
Fanny Price	I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his manners ; if he understood me as well , he would , I dare say , behave differently .
Fanny Price	I do not know what I write , but it would be a great favour of you never to mention the subject again .
Fanny Price	With thanks for the honour of your note , I remain , dear Miss Crawford , & c. , & c. ”
Fanny Price	The conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright , for she found that Mr. Crawford , under pretence of receiving the note , was coming towards her .
Fanny Price	“ You can not think I mean to hurry you , ” said he , in an undervoice , perceiving the amazing trepidation with which she made up the note , “ you can not think I have any such object .
Fanny Price	Do not hurry yourself , I entreat . ”
Fanny Price	I thank you ; I have quite done , just done ; it will be ready in a moment ; I am very much obliged to you ; if you will be so good as to give _ that _ to Miss Crawford
Fanny Price	The note was held out , and must be taken ; and as she instantly and with averted eyes walked towards the fireplace , where sat the others , he had nothing to do but to go in good earnest . Fanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation , both of pain and pleasure ; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to die with the day ; for every day would restore the knowledge of William ’s advancement , whereas the pain , she hoped , would return no more .
Fanny Price	She had no doubt that her note must appear excessively ill - written , that the language would disgrace a child , for her distress had allowed no arrangement ; but at least it would assure them both of her being neither imposed on nor gratified by Mr. Crawford ’s attentions .
Henry Crawford	The gentleman was not so easily satisfied .
Henry Crawford	He had all the disposition to persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him .
Henry Crawford	He had vanity , which strongly inclined him in the first place to think she did love him , though she might not know it herself ; and which , secondly , when constrained at last to admit that she did know her own present feelings , convinced him that he should be able in time to make those feelings what he wished .
Henry Crawford	He was in love , very much in love ; and it was a love which , operating on an active , sanguine spirit , of more warmth than delicacy , made her affection appear of greater consequence because it was withheld , and determined him to have the glory , as well as the felicity , of forcing her to love him .
Henry Crawford	He would not despair : he would not desist .
Henry Crawford	He had every well - grounded reason for solid attachment ; he knew her to have all the worth that could justify the warmest hopes of lasting happiness with her ; her conduct at this very time , by speaking the disinterestedness and delicacy of her character ( qualities which he believed most rare indeed ) , was of a sort to heighten all his wishes , and confirm all his resolutions .
Henry Crawford	He knew not that he had a pre - engaged heart to attack .
Henry Crawford	he
Henry Crawford	He considered her rather as one who had never thought on the subject enough to be in danger ; who had been guarded by youth , a youth of mind as lovely as of person ; whose modesty had prevented her from understanding his attentions , and who was still overpowered by the suddenness of addresses so wholly unexpected , and the novelty of a situation which her fancy had never taken into account .
Henry Crawford	Must it not follow of course , that , when he was understood , he should succeed ?
Henry Crawford	He believed it fully .
Henry Crawford	Love such as his , in a man like himself , must with perseverance secure a return , and at no great distance ; and he had so much delight in the idea of obliging her to love him in a very short time , that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted .
Henry Crawford	A little difficulty to be overcome was no evil to Henry Crawford .
Henry Crawford	He rather derived spirits from it .
Henry Crawford	He had been apt to gain hearts too easily .
Henry Crawford	His situation was new and animating .
Henry Crawford	She found that he did mean to persevere ; but how he could , after such language from her as she felt herself obliged to use , was not to be understood .
Henry Crawford	She told him that she did not love him , could not love him , was sure she never should love him ; that such a change was quite impossible ; that the subject was most painful to her ; that she must entreat him never to mention it again , to allow her to leave him at once , and let it be considered as concluded for ever .
Henry Crawford	All this she had said , and with the earnestness of sincerity ; yet this was not enough , for he immediately denied there being anything uncongenial in their characters , or anything unfriendly in their situations ; and positively declared , that he would still love , and still hope !
Henry Crawford	Her diffidence , gratitude , and softness made every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of self - denial ; seem , at least , to be giving nearly as much pain to herself as to him .
Henry Crawford	Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who , as the clandestine , insidious , treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram , had been her abhorrence , whom she had hated to see or to speak to , in whom she could believe no good quality to exist , and whose power , even of being agreeable , she had barely acknowledged .
Henry Crawford	He was now the Mr. Crawford who was addressing herself with ardent , disinterested love ; whose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and upright , whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of attachment ; who was pouring out his sense of her merits , describing and describing again his affection , proving as far as words could prove it , and in the language , tone , and spirit of a man of talent too , that he sought her for her gentleness and her goodness ; and to complete the whole , he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William ’s promotion ! Here was a change , and here were claims which could not but operate !
Henry Crawford	She might have disdained him in all the dignity of angry virtue , in the grounds of Sotherton , or the theatre at Mansfield Park ; but he approached her now with rights that demanded different treatment .
Henry Crawford	The effect of the whole was a manner so pitying and agitated , and words intermingled with her refusal so expressive of obligation and concern , that to a temper of vanity and hope like Crawford ’s , the truth , or at least the strength of her indifference , might well be questionable ; and he was not so irrational as Fanny considered him , in the professions of persevering , assiduous , and not desponding attachment which closed the interview .
Henry Crawford	It was with reluctance that he suffered her to go ; but there was no look of despair in parting to belie his words , or give her hopes of his being less unreasonable than he professed himself .
Henry Crawford	How evidently was there a gross want of feeling and humanity where his own pleasure was concerned — And , alas !
Henry Crawford	own affections been as free — as perhaps they ought to have been — he never could have engaged them .
Henry Crawford	So thought Fanny , in good truth and sober sadness , as she sat musing over that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs : wondering at the past and present ; wondering at what was yet to come , and in a nervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of her being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford , and the felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it .
Henry Crawford	He then saw Mr. Crawford , and received his account .
Henry Crawford	The first feeling was disappointment : he had hoped better things ; he had thought that an hour ’s entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked so little change on a gentle - tempered girl like Fanny ; but there was
Henry Crawford	speedy comfort in the determined views and sanguine perseverance of the lover ; and when seeing such confidence of success in the principal , Sir Thomas was soon able to depend on it himself .
Henry Crawford	Mr. Crawford ’s steadiness was honoured , and Fanny was praised , and the connexion was still the most desirable in the world .
Henry Crawford	At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome ; he had only to consult his own judgment and feelings as to the frequency of his visits , at present or in future .
Henry Crawford	In all his niece ’s family and friends , there could be but one opinion , one wish on the subject ; the influence of all who loved her must incline one way . Everything was said that could encourage , every encouragement received with grateful joy , and the gentlemen parted the best of friends .
Henry Crawford	Accordingly , on this principle , Sir Thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her , with a mild gravity , intended to be overcoming , “ Well , Fanny , I have seen Mr. Crawford again , and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you .
Henry Crawford	He is a most extraordinary young man , and whatever be the event ,
Henry Crawford	With him it is entirely a matter of feeling : he claims no merit in it ; perhaps is entitled to none .
Henry Crawford	Yet , having chosen so well , his constancy has a respectable stamp .
Henry Crawford	Had his choice been less unexceptionable , I should have condemned his persevering . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Indeed , sir , ” said Fanny , “ I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should continue to — I know that it is paying me a very great compliment , and I feel most undeservedly honoured ; but I am so perfectly convinced , and I
Henry Crawford	told him so , that it never will be in my power —
Henry Crawford	Your happiness and advantage are all that I have in view , and nothing is required of you but to bear with Mr. Crawford ’s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his .
Henry Crawford	He proceeds at his own risk .
Henry Crawford	I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls , as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred .
Henry Crawford	You will see him with the rest of us , in the same manner , and , as much as you can , dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant .
Henry Crawford	He leaves Northamptonshire so soon , that even this slight sacrifice can not be
Henry Crawford	She could not , though only eighteen , suppose Mr. Crawford ’s attachment would hold out for ever ; she could not but imagine that steady , unceasing discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time .
Henry Crawford	In spite of his intended silence , Sir Thomas found himself once more obliged to mention the subject to his niece , to prepare her briefly for its being imparted to her aunts ; a measure which he would still have avoided , if possible , but which became necessary from the totally opposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding .
Henry Crawford	It was an injury and affront to Julia , who ought to have been Mr. Crawford ’s choice ; and , independently of that , she disliked Fanny , because she had neglected her ; and she would have grudged such an elevation to one whom she had been always trying to depress .
Henry Crawford	I could do very well without you , if you were married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford .
Henry Crawford	“ I will tell you what , Fanny , ” said she , “ I am sure he fell in love with you at the ball ; I am sure the mischief was done that evening .
Henry Crawford	“ If it were possible for me to do otherwise ” said she , with another strong effort ; “ but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him happy , and that I should be miserable myself . ” Another burst of tears ; but in spite of that burst , and in spite of that great black word _ miserable _ , which served to introduce it , Sir Thomas began to think a little relenting , a little change of inclination , might have something to do with it ; and to augur favourably from the personal entreaty of the young man himself .
Henry Crawford	He knew her to be very timid , and exceedingly nervous ; and thought it not improbable that her mind might be in such a state as a little time , a little pressing , a little patience , and a little impatience , a judicious mixture of all on the lover ’s side , might work their usual effect on .
Henry Crawford	If the gentleman would but persevere , if he had but love enough to persevere , Sir Thomas began to have hopes ; and these reflections having passed across his mind and cheered it , “ Well , ” said he , in a tone of becoming gravity , but of less anger , “ well , child , dry up your tears .
Henry Crawford	Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting too long already .
Henry Crawford	You must give him your own answer : we can not expect him to be satisfied with less ; and you only can explain to him
Henry Crawford	the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments , which , unfortunately for himself , he certainly has imbibed
Henry Crawford	He might have softened his father ; but all , perhaps all , would think her selfish and ungrateful .
Henry Crawford	She could not but feel some resentment against Mr. Crawford ; yet ,
Henry Crawford	if he really loved her , and were unhappy too !
Henry Crawford	There was comfort , too , in his words , as well as his manner , for he began with , “ Mr. Crawford is gone : he has just left me .
Henry Crawford	I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling , by an account of what he has felt .
Henry Crawford	Suffice it , that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous manner , and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding , heart , and temper .
Henry Crawford	Upon my representation of what you were suffering , he immediately , and with the greatest delicacy , ceased to urge to see you for the present . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Of course , ” continued her uncle , “ it can not be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone , be it only for five minutes ; a request too natural , a claim too just to be denied .
Henry Crawford	Even to see Mr. Crawford would be less overpowering .
Henry Crawford	It was over , however , at last ; and the evening set in with more composure to Fanny , and more cheerfulness of spirits than she could have hoped for after so stormy a morning ; but she trusted , in the first place , that she had done right : that her judgment had not misled her . For the purity of her intentions she could answer ; and she was willing to hope , secondly , that her uncle ’s displeasure was abating , and would abate farther as he considered the matter with more impartiality , and felt , as a good man must feel , how wretched , and how unpardonable , how hopeless , and how wicked it was to marry without affection . When the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past , she could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally concluded , and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield , that everything would soon be as if no such subject had existed .
Henry Crawford	She would not , could not believe , that Mr. Crawford ’s affection for her could distress him long ; his mind was not of that sort .
Henry Crawford	In London he would soon learn to wonder at his infatuation , and be thankful for the right reason in her which had saved him from its evil consequences . While Fanny ’s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes , her uncle was , soon after tea , called out of the room ; an occurrence too common to strike her , and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared ten minutes afterwards , and advancing decidedly towards herself , said , “ Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you , ma’am , in his own room . ”
Henry Crawford	Mrs. Norris , much discontented , was obliged to compose herself to work again ; and Fanny , walking off in agitating consciousness , found herself , as she anticipated , in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford .
Henry Crawford	It was a gentleman ’s voice ; it was a voice that Fanny was just turning pale about , when Mr. Crawford walked into the room .
Henry Crawford	Good sense , like hers , will always act when really called upon ; and she found that she had been able to name him to her mother , and recall her remembrance of the name , as that of “ William ’s friend , ” though she could not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable at such a moment .
Henry Crawford	The consciousness of his being known there only as William ’s friend
Henry Crawford	Having introduced him , however , and being all reseated , the terrors that occurred of what this visit might lead to were overpowering , and she fancied herself on the point of fainting away .
Henry Crawford	While trying to keep herself alive , their visitor , who had at first approached her with as animated a countenance as ever , was wisely and kindly keeping his eyes away , and giving her time to recover , while he devoted himself entirely to her mother , addressing her , and attending to her with the utmost politeness and propriety , at the same time with a degree of friendliness , of interest at least , which was making his manner perfect . Mrs. Price ’s manners were also at their best .
Henry Crawford	Warmed by the sight of such a friend to her son , and regulated by the wish of appearing to advantage before him , she was overflowing with gratitude — artless , maternal gratitude — which could not be unpleasing .
Henry Crawford	Mr. Price was out , which she regretted very much .
Henry Crawford	Fanny was just recovered enough to feel that _ she _ could not regret it ; for to her many other sources of uneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which he found her .
Henry Crawford	They talked of William , a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire ; and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart could wish .
Henry Crawford	She felt that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life ; and was only astonished to find that , so great and so agreeable as he was , he should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to the port - admiral , nor the commissioner , nor yet with the intention of going over to the island , nor of seeing the dockyard .
Henry Crawford	Nothing of all that she had been used to think of as the proof of importance , or the employment of wealth , had brought him to Portsmouth .
Henry Crawford	He had reached it late the night before , was come for a day or two , was staying at the Crown , had accidentally met with a navy officer or two of his acquaintance since his arrival , but had no object of that kind in coming .
Henry Crawford	By the time he had given all this information , it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to ; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye , and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London ; that she had sent her best and kindest love , but had had no time for writing ; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour , having spent scarcely twenty - four hours in London , after his return from Norfolk , before he set off again ; that her cousin Edmund was in town , had been in town , he understood , a few days ; that he had not seen him himself , but that he was well , had left them all well at Mansfield , and was to dine , as yesterday , with the Frasers .
Henry Crawford	After talking a little more about Mansfield , a subject in which her interest was most apparent , Crawford began to hint at the expediency of an early walk .
Henry Crawford	“ It was a lovely morning , and at that season of the year a fine morning so often turned off , that it was wisest for everybody not to delay their exercise ” ; and such hints producing nothing , he soon proceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price and her daughters to take their walk without loss of time .
Henry Crawford	“ Would she not , then , persuade her daughters to take advantage of such weather , and allow him the pleasure of attending them ? ”
Henry Crawford	And the consequence was , that Fanny , strange as it was — strange , awkward , and distressing — found herself and Susan , within ten minutes , walking towards the High Street with Mr. Crawford .
Henry Crawford	He stopt ; and , ungentlemanlike as he looked , Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr. Crawford .
Henry Crawford	She could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr. Crawford must be struck .
Henry Crawford	Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his future father - in - law with any idea of taking him for a model in dress ; but ( as Fanny instantly , and to her great relief , discerned ) her father was a very different man , a very different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly respected stranger , from what he was in his own family at home .
Henry Crawford	Such was his instinctive compliment to the good manners of Mr. Crawford ; and , be the consequence what it might , Fanny ’s immediate feelings were infinitely soothed .
Henry Crawford	The conclusion of the two gentlemen ’s civilities was an offer of Mr. Price ’s to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard , which Mr. Crawford , desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such , though he had seen the dockyard again and again , and hoping to be so much the longer with Fanny , was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of , if the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue ; and as it was somehow or other ascertained , or inferred , or at least acted upon , that they were not at all afraid , to the dockyard they were all to go ; and but for Mr. Crawford , Mr. Price would have turned thither directly , without the smallest consideration for his daughters ’ errands in the High Street .
Henry Crawford	He took care , however , that they should be allowed to go to the shops they came out expressly to visit ; and it did not delay them long , for Fanny could so little bear to excite impatience , or be waited for , that before the gentlemen , as they stood at the door , could do more than begin upon the last naval regulations , or settle the number of three - deckers now in commission , their companions were ready to proceed
Henry Crawford	They were then to set forward for the dockyard at once , and the walk would have been conducted — according to Mr. Crawford ’s opinion — in a singular manner , had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of it , as the two girls , he found , would have been left to follow , and keep up with them or not , as they could , while they walked on together at their own hasty pace .
Henry Crawford	He was able to introduce some improvement occasionally , though by no means to the extent he wished ; he absolutely would not walk away from them ; and at any crossing or any crowd , when Mr. Price was only calling out , “ Come , girls ; come , Fan ; come , Sue , take care of yourselves ; keep a sharp lookout ! ” he would give them his particular attendance .
Henry Crawford	Once fairly in the dockyard , he began to reckon upon some happy intercourse with Fanny , as they were very soon joined by a brother lounger of Mr. Price ’s , who was come to take his daily survey of how things went on , and who must prove a far more worthy companion than himself ; and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied going about together , and discussing matters of equal and never - failing interest , while the young people sat down upon some timbers in the yard , or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all went to look at .
Henry Crawford	Crawford could not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down ; but he could have wished her sister away .
Henry Crawford	He must content himself with being only generally agreeable , and letting Susan have her share of entertainment , with the indulgence , now and then , of a look or hint for the better - informed and conscious Fanny .
Henry Crawford	what he had mostly to talk of
Henry Crawford	: there he had been some time , and everything there was rising in importance from his present schemes .
Henry Crawford	Such a man could come from no place , no society , without importing something to amuse ; his journeys and his acquaintance were all of use , and Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her .
Henry Crawford	For Fanny , somewhat more was related than the accidental agreeableness of the parties he had been in .
Henry Crawford	For her approbation , the particular reason of his going into Norfolk at all , at this unusual time of year , was given .
Henry Crawford	It had been real business , relative to the renewal of a lease in which the welfare of a large and — he believed — industrious family was at stake .
Henry Crawford	He had suspected his agent of some underhand dealing ; of meaning to bias him against the deserving ; and he had determined to go himself , and thoroughly investigate the merits of the case .
Henry Crawford	He had gone , had done even more good than he had foreseen , had been useful to more than his first plan had comprehended , and was now able to congratulate himself upon it , and to feel that in performing a duty , he had secured agreeable recollections for his own mind .
Henry Crawford	He had introduced himself to some tenants whom he had never seen before ; he had begun making acquaintance with cottages whose very existence , though on his own estate , had been hitherto unknown to him .
Henry Crawford	It was pleasing to hear him speak so properly ; here he had been acting as he ought to do .
Henry Crawford	Nothing could be more grateful to her ; and she was on the point of giving him an approving look , when it was all frightened off by his adding a something too pointed of his hoping soon to have an assistant , a friend , a guide in every plan of utility or charity for Everingham : a somebody that would make Everingham and all about it a dearer object than it had ever been yet .
Henry Crawford	She turned away , and wished he would not say such things .
Henry Crawford	She was willing to allow he might have more good qualities than she had been wo nt to suppose .
Henry Crawford	She began to feel the possibility of his turning out well at last ; but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her , and ought not to think of her .
Henry Crawford	He perceived that enough had been said of Everingham , and that it would be as well to talk of something else , and turned to Mansfield .
Henry Crawford	He could not have chosen better ; that was a topic to bring back her attention and her looks almost instantly .
Henry Crawford	He had a great attachment to Mansfield himself ; he said so ; he looked forward with the hope of spending much , very much , of his time there ; always there , or in the neighbourhood .
Henry Crawford	He particularly built upon a very happy summer and autumn there this year ; he felt that it would be so : he depended upon it ; a summer and autumn infinitely superior to the last .
Henry Crawford	“ Mansfield , Sotherton , Thornton Lacey , ” he continued ; “ what a society will be comprised in those houses !
Henry Crawford	And at Michaelmas , perhaps , a fourth may be added : some small hunting - box in the vicinity of everything so dear ; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey , as Edmund Bertram once good - humouredly proposed , I hope I foresee two objections : two fair , excellent , irresistible objections to that plan .
Henry Crawford	Fanny was doubly silenced here ; though when the moment was passed , could regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged comprehension of one half of his meaning , and encouraged him to say something more of his sister and Edmund .
Henry Crawford	When Mr. Price and his friend had seen all that they wished , or had time for , the others were ready to return ; and in the course of their walk back
Henry Crawford	, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute ’s privacy for telling Fanny that his only business in Portsmouth was to see her ; that he was come down for a couple of days on her account , and hers only , and because he could not endure a longer total separation . She was sorry , really sorry ; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said , she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him ; he was much more gentle , obliging , and attentive to other people ’s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield ; she had never seen him so agreeable — so _ near _ being agreeable ; his behaviour to her father could not offend , and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of Susan . He was decidedly improved .
Henry Crawford	She wished the next day over , she wished he had come only for one day ; but it was not so very bad as she would have expected : the pleasure of talking of Mansfield was so very great !
Henry Crawford	Before they parted , she had to thank him for another pleasure , and one of no trivial kind .
Henry Crawford	Her father asked him to do them the honour of taking his mutton with them , and Fanny had time for only one thrill of horror , before he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement .
Henry Crawford	He was engaged to dinner already both for that day and the next ; he had met with some acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied ; he should have the honour , however , of waiting on them again on the morrow , etc . , and so they parted — Fanny in a state of actual felicity from escaping so horrible an evil !
Henry Crawford	To have had him join their family dinner - party , and see all their deficiencies , would have been dreadful !
Henry Crawford	_ She _ was nice only from natural delicacy , but _ he _ had been brought up in a school of luxury and epicurism .
Henry Crawford	XLIII It was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back , to London , on the morrow , for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price ’s ; and two days afterwards , it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letter from his sister , opened and read by her , on another account , with the most anxious curiosity :
Henry Crawford	He makes me write , but I do not know what else is to be communicated , except this said visit to Portsmouth , and these two said walks , and his introduction to your family , especially to a fair sister of yours , a fine girl of fifteen , who was of the party on the ramparts , taking her first lesson , I presume , in love .
Henry Crawford	I have not time for writing much , but it would be out of place if I had , for this is to be a mere letter of business , penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information , which could not be delayed without risk of evil .
Henry Crawford	My dear , dear Fanny , if I had you here , how I would talk to you !
Henry Crawford	You should listen to me till you were tired , and advise me till you were still tired more ; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper , so I will abstain altogether , and leave you to guess what you like .
Henry Crawford	I have no news for you .
Henry Crawford	You have politics , of course ; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people and parties that fill up my time .
Henry Crawford	I ought to have sent you an account of your cousin ’s first party , but I was lazy , and now it is too long
Henry Crawford	; suffice it , that everything was just as it ought to be , in a style that any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness , and that her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit . My friend , Mrs. Fraser , is mad for such a house , and it would not make _ me _ miserable . I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter ; she seems in high spirits , and very happy .
Henry Crawford	I fancy Lord S. is very good - humoured and pleasant in his own family , and I do not think him so very ill - looking as I did — at least , one sees many worse .
Henry Crawford	He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund .
Henry Crawford	Of the last - mentioned hero , what shall I say ?
Henry Crawford	If I avoided his name entirely , it would look suspicious .
Henry Crawford	I will say , then , that we have seen him two or three times , and that my friends here are very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance .
Henry Crawford	Mrs. Fraser ( no bad judge ) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a person , height , and air ; and I must confess , when he dined here the other day , there were none to compare with him , and we were a party of sixteen .
Henry Crawford	“ I had almost forgot ( it was Edmund ’s fault : he gets into my head more than does me good ) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and myself — I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire .
Henry Crawford	My dear little creature , do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks .
Henry Crawford	My poor aunt always felt affected if within ten miles of the sea , which the Admiral of course never believed , but I know it was so .
Henry Crawford	I am at your service and Henry ’s , at an hour ’s notice .
Henry Crawford	I should like the scheme , and we would make a little circuit , and shew you Everingham in our way , and perhaps you would not mind passing through London , and seeing the inside of St. George ’s , Hanover Square .
Henry Crawford	Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such a time : I should not like to be tempted .
Henry Crawford	Henry , I find , has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon some business that _ you _ approve ; but this can not possibly be permitted before the middle of next week ; that is , he can not anyhow be spared till after the 14th , for _ we _ have a party that evening .
Henry Crawford	The value of a man like Henry , on such an occasion , is what you can have no conception of ; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable .
Henry Crawford	He will see the Rushworths , which I own I am not sorry for — having a little curiosity , and so I think has he — though he will not acknowledge it .
Henry Crawford	Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr. Crawford and herself , touched her , in comparison , slightly .
Henry Crawford	Whether Mr. Crawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no concern of hers , though , everything considered , she thought he _ would _ go without delay .
Henry Crawford	That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a meeting between him and Mrs. Rushworth , was all in her worst line of conduct , and grossly unkind and ill - judged ; but she hoped _ he _ would not be actuated by any such degrading curiosity .
Henry Crawford	He acknowledged no such inducement , and his sister ought to have given him credit for better feelings than her own .
Henry Crawford	If Mr. Crawford remembered her message to her cousin , she thought it very likely , most likely , that he would write to her at all events ; it would be most consistent with his usual kindness ; and till she got rid of this idea , till it gradually wore off , by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days more , she was in a most restless , anxious state .
Henry Crawford	And had it been possible for her to return Mr. Crawford ’s regard , the probability of his being very far from objecting to such a measure would have been the greatest increase of all her own comforts .
Henry Crawford	She thought he was really good - tempered , and could fancy his entering into a plan of that sort most pleasantly .
Henry Crawford	When you give me your opinion , I always know what is right .
Henry Crawford	Your judgment is my rule of right . ”
Henry Crawford	Good - bye ; I wish you a pleasant journey to - morrow .
Henry Crawford	“ Is there nothing I can do for you in town ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ Have you no message for anybody ? ” “ My love to your sister , if you please ; and when you see my cousin , my cousin Edmund , I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him . ” “ Certainly ; and if he is lazy or negligent , I will write his excuses myself . ” He could say no more , for Fanny would be no longer detained .
Henry Crawford	He pressed her hand , looked at her , and was gone .
Henry Crawford	He _ went to while away the next three hours as he could , with his other acquaintance , till the best dinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment , and _ she _ turned in to her more simple one immediately .
Henry Crawford	Their general fare bore a very different character ; and could he have suspected how many privations , besides that of exercise , she endured in her father ’s house , he would have wondered that her looks were not much more affected than he found them .
Henry Crawford	After being nursed up at Mansfield , it was too late in the day to be hardened at Portsmouth ; and though Sir Thomas , had he known all , might have thought his niece in the most promising way of being starved , both mind and body , into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford ’s good company and good fortune , he would probably have feared to push his experiment farther , lest she might die under the cure . Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day .
Henry Crawford	Though tolerably secure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again , she could not help being low .
Henry Crawford	It was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend ; and though , in one light , glad to have him gone , it seemed as if she was now deserted by everybody ; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield ; and she could not think of his returning to town , and being frequently with Mary and Edmund , without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate herself for having them .
Henry Crawford	The wonderful improvement which she still fancied in Mr. Crawford was the nearest to administering comfort of anything within the current of her thoughts .
Henry Crawford	Not considering in how different a circle she had been just seeing him , nor how much might be owing to contrast , she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and regardful of others than formerly .
Henry Crawford	So anxious for her health and comfort , so very feeling as he now expressed himself , and really seemed , might not it be fairly supposed that he would not much longer persevere in a suit so distressing to her ?
Henry Crawford	— “ I have to inform you , my dearest Fanny , that Henry has been down to Portsmouth to see you ; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday , and one still more to be dwelt on the next day , on the ramparts ; when the balmy air , the sparkling sea , and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony , and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect .
Henry Crawford	He makes me write , but I do not know what else is to be communicated , except this said visit to Portsmouth , and these two said walks , and his introduction to your family , especially to a fair sister of yours , a fine girl of fifteen , who was of the party on the ramparts , taking her first lesson , I presume , in love .
Henry Crawford	“ I had almost forgot ( it was Edmund ’s fault : he gets into my head more than does me good ) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and myself — I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire .
Henry Crawford	I am at your service and Henry ’s , at an hour ’s notice .
Henry Crawford	Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such a time : I should not like to be tempted .
Henry Crawford	Henry , I find , has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon some business that _ you _ approve ; but this can not possibly be permitted before the middle of next week ; that is , he can not anyhow be spared till after the 14th , for _ we _ have a party that evening .
Henry Crawford	The value of a man like Henry , on such an occasion , is what you can have no conception of ; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable .
Henry Crawford	He will see the Rushworths , which I own I am not sorry for — having a little curiosity , and so I think has he — though he will not acknowledge it .
Henry Crawford	Edmund had not yet spoken .
Henry Crawford	How Miss Crawford really felt , how she meant to act , or might act without or against her meaning ; whether his importance to her were quite what it had been before the last separation ; whether , if lessened , it were likely to lessen more , or to recover itself , were subjects for endless conjecture , and to be thought of on that day and many days to come , without producing any conclusion .
Henry Crawford	The idea that returned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford , after proving herself cooled and staggered by a return to London habits , would yet prove herself in the end too much attached to him to give him up .
Henry Crawford	The prospect for her cousin grew worse and worse .
Henry Crawford	The woman who could speak of him , and speak only of his appearance !
Henry Crawford	_ She _ who had known him intimately half a year
Henry Crawford	If Mr. Crawford remembered her message to her cousin , she thought it very likely , most likely , that he would write to her at all events ; it would be most consistent with his usual kindness ; and till she got rid of this idea , till it gradually wore off , by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days more , she was in a most restless , anxious state .
Henry Crawford	“ Have you no message for anybody ? ” “ My love to your sister , if you please ; and when you see my cousin , my cousin Edmund , I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him . ” “ Certainly ; and if he is lazy or negligent , I will write his excuses myself . ” He could say no more , for Fanny would be no longer detained .
Henry Crawford	XXXV Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse whether her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned between them or not ; and that if she did not lead the way , it should never be touched on by him ; but after a day or two of mutual reserve , he was induced by his father to change his mind , and try what his influence might do for his friend .
Henry Crawford	A day , and a very early day , was actually fixed for the Crawfords ’ departure ; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one more effort for the young man before he left Mansfield , that all his professions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to sustain them as possible .
Henry Crawford	Sir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of Mr. Crawford ’s character in that point .
Henry Crawford	He wished him to be a model of constancy ; and fancied the best means of effecting it would be by not trying him too long .
Henry Crawford	I dare say that , on a comparison of our opinions , they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be : to the point — I consider Crawford ’s proposals as most advantageous and desirable , if you could return his affection .
Henry Crawford	I consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it ; but that , as you can not , you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him .
Henry Crawford	But I thought you blamed me .
Henry Crawford	I thought you were against me .
Henry Crawford	You did not love him ; nothing could have justified your accepting him . ” Fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days . “ So far your conduct has been faultless , and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise .
Henry Crawford	Crawford ’s is no common attachment ; he perseveres , with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before .
Henry Crawford	But ” ( with an affectionate smile ) “ let him succeed at last , Fanny , let him succeed at last .
Henry Crawford	he never will succeed with me . ”
Henry Crawford	And she spoke with a warmth which quite astonished Edmund , and which she blushed at the recollection of herself , when she saw his look , and heard him reply , “ Never !
Henry Crawford	This is not like yourself , your rational self . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I mean , ” she cried , sorrowfully correcting herself , “ that I _ think _ I never shall , as far as the future can be answered for ; I think I never shall return his regard . ”
Henry Crawford	I am aware , more aware than Crawford can be , that the man who means to make you love him ( you having due notice of his intentions ) must have very uphill work , for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array ; and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate , which so many years ’ growth have confirmed , and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation .
Henry Crawford	I exclude extremes , of course ; and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the
Henry Crawford	Miss Crawford ’s power was all returning .
Henry Crawford	He had been speaking of her cheerfully from the hour of his coming home .
Henry Crawford	His avoiding her was quite at an end .
Henry Crawford	After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes , Fanny , feeling it due to herself , returned to Mr. Crawford , and said , “ It is not merely in _ temper _ that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself ; though , in _ that _ respect , I think the difference between us too great , infinitely too great : his spirits often oppress me ; but there is something in him which I object to still more .
Henry Crawford	I must say , cousin , that I can not approve his character .
Henry Crawford	I have not thought well of him from the time of the play .
Henry Crawford	I then saw him behaving , as it appeared to me , so very improperly and unfeelingly — I may speak of it now because it is all over — so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth , not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him , and paying attentions to my cousin Maria , which — in short , at the time of the play , I received an impression which will never be got over .
Henry Crawford	Maria was wrong , Crawford was wrong , we were all wrong together ; but none so wrong as myself
Henry Crawford	“ Before the play , I am much mistaken if _ Julia _ did not think he was paying her attentions . ”
Henry Crawford	I have heard before from some one of his being in love with Julia ; but I could never see anything of it .
Henry Crawford	And , Fanny , though I hope I do justice to my sisters ’ good qualities , I think it very possible that they might , one or both , be more desirous of being admired by Crawford , and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent .
Henry Crawford	I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society ; and with such encouragement , a man like Crawford , lively , and it may be , a little unthinking , might be led on to — there could be nothing very striking , because it is clear that he had no pretensions : his heart was reserved for you .
Henry Crawford	And I must say , that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion .
Henry Crawford	It does him the highest honour ; it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment .
Henry Crawford	It proves him unspoilt by his uncle .
Henry Crawford	It proves him , in short , everything that I had been used to wish to believe him , and feared he was not .
Henry Crawford	” “ I am persuaded that he does not think , as he ought , on serious subjects . ” “ Say , rather , that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects , which I believe to be a good deal the case .
Henry Crawford	Crawford ’s _ feelings _ , I am ready to acknowledge , have hitherto been too much his guides .
Henry Crawford	He will make you happy , Fanny ; I know he will make you happy ; but you will make him everything .
Henry Crawford	I have no common interest in Crawford ’s well - doing .
Henry Crawford	Next to your happiness , Fanny , his has the first claim on me .
Henry Crawford	You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford .
Henry Crawford	Edmund first began again — “ I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday , particularly pleased , because I had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light .
Henry Crawford	I knew she was very fond of you ; but yet I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved , and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune .
Henry Crawford	I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims , which she has been too much used to hear .
Henry Crawford	She spoke of you , Fanny , just as she ought .
Henry Crawford	She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself .
Henry Crawford	I should not have mentioned the subject , though very anxious to know her sentiments ; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart , and sweet peculiarity of manner , that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself .
Henry Crawford	Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity . ” “ Was Mrs. Grant in the room , then ? ” “ Yes , when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in .
Henry Crawford	“ It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Yes , she laments it ; yet owns it may have been best .
Henry Crawford	You will see her , however , before she goes .
Henry Crawford	She is very angry with you , Fanny ; you must be prepared for that .
Henry Crawford	She calls herself very angry , but you can imagine her anger .
Henry Crawford	wish you could have seen her countenance , when she said that you _ should _ be Henry ’s wife .
Henry Crawford	That you could refuse such a man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand .
Henry Crawford	Let him have all the perfections in the world , I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself .
Henry Crawford	But , even supposing it is so , allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has , how was I to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own ?
Henry Crawford	He took me wholly by surprise .
Henry Crawford	I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning ; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me .
Henry Crawford	In my situation , it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on Mr. Crawford .
Henry Crawford	I am sure his sisters , rating him as they do , must have thought it so , supposing he had meant nothing .
Henry Crawford	How , then , was I to be — to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me ?
Henry Crawford	How was I to have an attachment at his service , as soon as it was asked for ?
Henry Crawford	His sisters should consider me as well as him .
Henry Crawford	The higher his deserts , the more improper for me ever to have thought of him .
Henry Crawford	You have now given exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant , and they were both better satisfied , though your warm - hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry .
Henry Crawford	I told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least ; and that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford ’s addresses was against him .
Henry Crawford	Miss Crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother .
Henry Crawford	She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time , and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years ’ happy marriage .
Henry Crawford	She feared she had been doing wrong : saying too much , overacting the caution which she had been fancying necessary ; in guarding against one evil , laying herself open to another ; and to have Miss Crawford ’s liveliness repeated to her at such a moment , and on such a subject , was a bitter aggravation . Edmund saw weariness and distress in her face , and immediately resolved to forbear all farther discussion ; and not even to mention the name of Crawford again , except as it might be connected with what _ must _ be agreeable to her .
Henry Crawford	You are sure , therefore , of seeing your friend either to - morrow or Sunday .
Henry Crawford	Those five or six days more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life . ” “ You were near staying there ? ” “ Very .
Henry Crawford	You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice . ” Still , however , Fanny was oppressed and wearied ; he saw it in her looks , it could not be talked away ; and attempting it no more , he led her directly , with the kind authority of a privileged guardian , into the house .
Henry Crawford	The Honourable John Yates , this new friend , had not much to recommend him beyond habits of fashion and expense , and being the younger son of a lord with a tolerable independence ; and Sir Thomas would probably have thought his introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable .
Henry Crawford	Mr. Bertram ’s acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth , where they had spent ten days together in the same society , and the friendship , if friendship it might be called , had been proved and perfected by Mr. Yates ’s being invited to take Mansfield in his way , whenever he could , and by his promising to come ; and he did come rather earlier than had been expected , in consequence of the sudden breaking - up of a large party assembled for gaiety at the house of another friend , which he had left Weymouth to join .
Henry Crawford	Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two characters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford ; and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign his to me , it was impossible to take it , you know .
Henry Crawford	Sir Henry thought the duke not equal to Frederick , but that was because Sir Henry wanted the part himself ; whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two .
Henry Crawford	I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick .
Henry Crawford	Luckily the strength of the piece did not depend upon him .
Henry Crawford	Our Agatha was inimitable , and the duke was thought very great by many .
Henry Crawford	would not hear of it . ” “ An afterpiece instead of a comedy , ” said Mr. Bertram .
Henry Crawford	We must rather adopt Mr. Crawford ’s views , and make the _ performance _ , not the _ theatre _ , our object .
Henry Crawford	“ True , to see real acting , good hardened real acting ; but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade : a set of gentlemen and ladies , who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through . ” After a short pause , however , the subject still continued , and was discussed with unabated eagerness , every one ’s inclination increasing by the discussion , and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest ; and though nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy , and his sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy , and that nothing in the world could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all , the resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as to make Edmund quite uncomfortable .
Henry Crawford	Maria , Julia , Henry Crawford , and Mr. Yates were in the billiard - room .
Henry Crawford	Tom , returning from them into the drawing - room , where Edmund was standing thoughtfully by the fire , while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at a little distance , and Fanny close beside her arranging her work , thus began as he entered—“Such a horribly vile billiard - table as ours is not to be met with , I believe , above ground .
Henry Crawford	” “ You are not serious , Tom , in meaning to act ? ” said Edmund , in a low voice , as his brother approached the fire .
Henry Crawford	never more so , I assure you .
Henry Crawford	What is there to surprise you in it ? ”
Henry Crawford	We may be trusted , I think , in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable ; and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own .
Henry Crawford	I have no fears and no scruples .
Henry Crawford	And as to my father ’s being absent , it is so far from an objection , that I consider it rather as a motive ; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother ; and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety , and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks , I shall think our time very well spent , and so , I am sure , will he .
Henry Crawford	As he said this , each looked towards their mother .
Henry Crawford	Well , Edmund , ” he continued , returning to the former subject , posture , and voice , as soon as Lady Bertram began to nod again , “ but _ this _ I _ will _ maintain , that we shall be doing no harm . ”
Henry Crawford	Nobody is fonder of the exercise of talent in young people , or promotes it more , than my father , and for anything of the acting , spouting , reciting kind , I think he has always a decided taste .
Henry Crawford	I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have ; and as to such alterations as I was suggesting just now , such as moving a bookcase , or unlocking a door , or even as using the billiard - room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it , you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room , and less in the breakfast - room , than we did before he went away , or to my sister ’s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other .
Henry Crawford	Something of a theatre we must have undoubtedly , but it will be on the simplest plan : a green curtain and a little carpenter ’s work , and that ’s all ; and as the carpenter ’s work may be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself , it will be too absurd to talk of expense ; and as long as Jackson is employed , everything will be right with Sir Thomas .
Henry Crawford	Your brother ’s taste and your sisters ’ seem very different . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I have no hope there , Fanny .
Henry Crawford	I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _ them _ , and that is all I can do . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I dare say she would , but she has no influence with either Tom or my sisters that could be of any use ; and if I can not convince them myself , I shall let things take their course , without attempting it through her .
Henry Crawford	” His sisters , to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next morning , were quite as impatient of his advice , quite as unyielding to his representation , quite as determined in the cause of pleasure , as Tom .
Henry Crawford	Each sister could echo the wish ; and Henry Crawford , to whom , in all the riot of his gratifications it was yet an untasted pleasure , was quite alive at the idea .
Henry Crawford	“ I really believe , ” said he , “ I could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written , from Shylock or Richard III down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat .
Henry Crawford	I feel as if I could be anything or everything ; as if I could rant and storm , or sigh or cut capers , in any tragedy or comedy in the English language .
Henry Crawford	Not these countenances , I am sure , ” looking towards the Miss Bertrams ; “ and for a theatre , what signifies a theatre ?
Henry Crawford	Edmund had little to hope , but he was still urging the subject when Henry Crawford entered the room , fresh from the Parsonage , calling out , “ No want of hands in our theatre , Miss Bertram .
Henry Crawford	No want of understrappers : my sister desires her love , and hopes to be admitted into the company , and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante , that you may not like to do yourselves .
Henry Crawford	Henry Crawford ’s retaining her hand at such a moment , a moment of such peculiar proof and importance , was worth ages of doubt and anxiety .
Henry Crawford	were no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer the anxious inquiry , and , encouraging him by all means to pay his respects to Sir Thomas without delay , sent him after the others with delighted haste . Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates .
Henry Crawford	“ It is time to think of our visitors , ” said Maria , still feeling her hand pressed to Henry Crawford ’s heart , and caring little for anything else .
Henry Crawford	“ Mr. Crawford was a most pleasant , gentleman - like man ; his sister a sweet , pretty , elegant , lively girl . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I do not say he is not gentleman - like , considering ; but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight , or he will be expecting a well - looking man . ”
Henry Crawford	Henry Crawford had trifled with her feelings ; but she had very long allowed and even sought his attentions , with a jealousy of her sister
Henry Crawford	so reasonable as ought to have been their cure ; and now that the conviction of his preference for Maria had been forced on her
Henry Crawford	For a day or two after the affront was given , Henry Crawford had endeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and compliment , but he had not cared enough about it to persevere against a few repulses ; and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for more than one flirtation , he grew indifferent to the quarrel , or rather thought it a lucky occurrence , as quietly putting an end to what might ere long have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant .
Henry Crawford	She was not pleased to see Julia excluded from the play , and sitting by disregarded ; but as it was not a matter which really involved her happiness , as Henry must be the best judge of his own , and
Henry Crawford	as he did assure her , with a most persuasive smile , that neither he nor Julia had ever had a serious thought of each other , she could only renew her former caution as to the elder sister , entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there , and then gladly take her share in anything that brought cheerfulness to the young people in general , and that did so particularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her . “ I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry , ” was her observation to Mary .
Henry Crawford	Do not give him a hint of it .
Henry Crawford	A man might represent the county with such an estate ; a man might escape a profession and represent the county . ” “ I dare say he _ will _ be in parliament soon .
Henry Crawford	But , Mary , do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry .
Henry Crawford	, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . ” “ I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth ’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . ” “ If you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . ”
Henry Crawford	Maria felt her triumph , and pursued her purpose , careless of Julia ; and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry Crawford without trusting that it would create jealousy , and bring a public disturbance at last .
Henry Crawford	He could not have devised anything more likely to raise his consequence than this week ’s absence , occurring as it did at the very time of her brother ’s going away , of William Price ’s going too , and completing the sort of general break - up of a party which had been so animated .
Henry Crawford	Had Henry returned , as he talked of doing , at the end of three or four days , she should now have been leaving Mansfield .
Henry Crawford	She could not live any longer in such solitary wretchedness ; and she made her way to the Park , through difficulties of walking which she had deemed unconquerable a week before , for the chance of hearing a little in addition , for the sake of at least hearing his name .
Henry Crawford	I am looking for Henry every day , and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield .
Henry Crawford	I should like to have seen him once more , I confess .
Henry Crawford	But you must give my compliments to him .
Henry Crawford	Was his letter a long one ?
Henry Crawford	Does he give you much account of what he is doing ?
Henry Crawford	Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for ? ” “ I only heard a part of the letter ; it was to my uncle ; but I believe it was very short ; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines .
Henry Crawford	All that I heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer , and that he had agreed to do so .
Henry Crawford	if he wrote to his father ; but I thought it might have been to Lady Bertram or you .
Henry Crawford	But if he wrote to his father , no wonder he was
Henry Crawford	If he had written to you , there would have been more particulars .
Henry Crawford	He would have sent you a description of everything and everybody .
Henry Crawford	Well , when your cousin comes back , he will find Mansfield very quiet ; all the noisy ones gone , your brother and mine and myself .
Henry Crawford	But I dare say you know exactly — I always imagine you are — perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all — or not at present . ”
Henry Crawford	Her companion looked at her keenly ; and gathering greater spirit from the blush soon produced from such a look , only said , “ He is best off as he is , ” and turned the subject .
Henry Crawford	XXXIX Could Sir Thomas have seen all his niece ’s feelings , when she wrote her first letter to her aunt , he would not have despaired ; for though a good night ’s rest , a pleasant morning , the hope of soon seeing William again , and the comparatively quiet state of the house , from Tom and Charles being gone to school , Sam on some project of his own , and her father on his usual lounges , enabled her to express herself cheerfully on the subject of home , there were still , to her own perfect consciousness , many drawbacks suppressed .
Henry Crawford	Could he have seen only half that she felt before the end of a week , he would have thought Mr. Crawford sure of her , and been delighted with his own sagacity . Before the week ended , it was all disappointment .
Henry Crawford	I have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world .
Henry Crawford	My uncle , who is the very best man in the world , has exerted himself , as I knew he would , after seeing your brother .
Henry Crawford	Your kindness to William makes me more obliged to you than words can express ; but I do not want , I can not bear , I must not listen to such — No , no , do n’t think of me .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He had all the disposition to persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas was obliged , or obliged himself , to wait till the morrow for a knowledge of what had passed between the young people .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He then saw Mr. Crawford , and received his account .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The first feeling was disappointment : he had hoped better things ; he had thought that an hour ’s entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked so little change on a gentle - tempered girl like Fanny ; but there was
Sir Thomas Bertram	speedy comfort in the determined views and sanguine perseverance of the lover ; and when seeing such confidence of success in the principal , Sir Thomas was soon able to depend on it himself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Nothing was omitted , on his side , of civility , compliment , or kindness , that might assist the plan .
Sir Thomas Bertram	In all his niece ’s family and friends , there could be but one opinion , one wish on the subject ; the influence of all who loved her must incline one way . Everything was said that could encourage , every encouragement received with grateful joy , and the gentlemen parted the best of friends .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Satisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most proper and hopeful , Sir Thomas resolved to abstain from all farther importunity with his niece , and to shew no open interference .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Upon her disposition he believed kindness might be the best way of working .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Accordingly , on this principle , Sir Thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her , with a mild gravity , intended to be overcoming , “ Well , Fanny , I have seen Mr. Crawford again , and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you .
Sir Thomas Bertram	you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common character ; though , young as you are , and little acquainted with the transient , varying , unsteady nature of love , as it generally exists , you can not be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against discouragement .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Had his choice been less unexceptionable , I should have condemned his persevering . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Indeed , sir , ” said Fanny , “ I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should continue to — I know that it is paying me a very great compliment , and I feel most undeservedly honoured ; but I am so perfectly convinced , and I
Sir Thomas Bertram	” “ My dear , ” interrupted Sir Thomas , “ there is no occasion for this .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Your feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you .
Sir Thomas Bertram	You can not suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Your happiness and advantage are all that I have in view , and nothing is required of you but to bear with Mr. Crawford ’s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls , as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred .
Sir Thomas Bertram	And now , my dear Fanny , this subject is closed between us .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Her uncle ’s kind expressions , however , and forbearing manner , were sensibly felt ; and when she considered how much of the
Sir Thomas Bertram	truth was unknown to him , she believed she had no right to wonder at the line of conduct he pursued .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He , who had married a daughter to Mr. Rushworth : romantic delicacy was certainly not to be expected from him .
Sir Thomas Bertram	In spite of his intended silence , Sir Thomas found himself once more obliged to mention the subject to his niece , to prepare her briefly for its being imparted to her aunts ; a measure which he would still have avoided , if possible , but which became necessary from the totally opposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He had no idea of concealment .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It was all known at the Parsonage , where he loved to talk over the future with both his sisters , and it would be rather gratifying to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progress of his success .
Sir Thomas Bertram	When Sir Thomas understood this , he felt the necessity of making his own wife and sister - in - law acquainted with the business without delay ; though , on Fanny ’s account , he almost dreaded the effect of the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He deprecated her mistaken but well - meaning zeal .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas , indeed , was , by this time , not very far from classing Mrs. Norris as one of those well - meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable things .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mrs. Norris , however , relieved him .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He pressed for the strictest forbearance and silence towards their niece ; she not only promised , but did observe it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas gave her more credit for discretion on the occasion than she deserved ; and Fanny could have blessed her for allowing her only to see her displeasure , and not to hear it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I must just speak of it _ once _ , I told Sir Thomas I must _ once _ , and then I shall have done .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ No , my dear , I should not think of missing you , when such an offer as this comes in your way .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I could do very well without you , if you were married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas said so .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that evening . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	After half a moment ’s pause : “ And I should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters , on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only _ half _ the eligibility of _ this _ , immediately and peremptorily , and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation , put a decided negative on it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect .
Sir Thomas Bertram	You do not owe me the duty of a child .
Sir Thomas Bertram	if your heart can acquit you of _ ingratitude _ — ” He ceased .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Fanny was by this time crying so bitterly that , angry as he was , he would not press that article farther .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Her heart was almost broke by such a picture of what she appeared to him ; by such accusations , so heavy , so multiplied , so rising in dreadful gradation !
Sir Thomas Bertram	He thought her all this .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She had deceived his expectations ; she had lost his good opinion .
Sir Thomas Bertram	yes , I hope you are sorry ; and you will probably have reason to be long sorry for this day ’s transactions . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ If it were possible for me to do otherwise ” said she , with another strong effort ; “ but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him happy , and that I should be miserable myself . ” Another burst of tears ; but in spite of that burst , and in spite of that great black word _ miserable _ , which served to introduce it , Sir Thomas began to think a little relenting , a little change of inclination , might have something to do with it ; and to augur favourably from the personal entreaty of the young man himself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He knew her to be very timid , and exceedingly nervous ; and thought it not improbable that her mind might be in such a state as a little time , a little pressing , a little patience , and a little impatience , a judicious mixture of all on the lover ’s side , might work their usual effect on .
Sir Thomas Bertram	If the gentleman would but persevere , if he had but love enough to persevere , Sir Thomas began to have hopes ; and these reflections having passed across his mind and cheered it , “ Well , ” said he , in a tone of becoming gravity , but of less anger , “ well , child , dry up your tears .
Sir Thomas Bertram	You must now come downstairs with me .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I am totally unequal to it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But Fanny shewed such reluctance , such misery , at the idea of going down to him , that Sir Thomas , after a little consideration , judged it better to indulge her .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered a small depression in consequence ; but when he looked at his niece , and saw the state of feature and complexion which her crying had brought her into , he thought there might be as much lost as gained by an immediate interview .
Sir Thomas Bertram	With a few words , therefore , of no particular meaning , he walked off by himself , leaving his poor niece to sit and cry over what had passed , with very wretched feelings .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But her uncle ’s anger gave her the severest pain of all .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Selfish and ungrateful ! to have appeared so to him !
Sir Thomas Bertram	In about a quarter of an hour her uncle returned ; she was almost ready to faint at the sight of him .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He spoke calmly , however , without austerity , without reproach , and she revived a little .
Sir Thomas Bertram	There was comfort , too , in his words , as well as his manner , for he began with , “ Mr. Crawford is gone : he has just left me .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I need not repeat what has passed .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling , by an account of what he has felt .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Suffice it , that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous manner , and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding , heart , and temper .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Upon my representation of what you were suffering , he immediately , and with the greatest delicacy , ceased to urge to see you for the present . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Of course , ” continued her uncle , “ it can not be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone , be it only for five minutes ; a request too natural , a claim too just to be denied .
Sir Thomas Bertram	If , as I am willing to suppose , you wish to shew me any observance , you will not give way to these emotions , but endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I advise you to go out : the air will do you good ; go out for an hour on the gravel ; you will have the shrubbery to yourself , and will be the better for air and exercise .
Sir Thomas Bertram	And , Fanny ” ( turning back again for a moment ) , “ I shall make no mention below of what has passed ; I shall not even tell your aunt Bertram .
Sir Thomas Bertram	he left her in a glow of gratitude .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She walked out directly , as her uncle recommended , and followed his advice throughout , as far as she could ; did check her tears ; did earnestly try to compose her spirits and strengthen her mind .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She wished to prove to him that she did desire his comfort , and sought to regain his favour ; and he had given her another strong motive for exertion , in keeping the whole affair from the knowledge of her aunts .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think of such a trifle again ; but she soon found , from the voluntary information of the housemaid , who came in to attend it , that so it was to be every day .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas had given orders for it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She saw nothing more of her uncle , nor of her aunt Norris , till they met at dinner .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Her uncle ’s behaviour to her was then as nearly as possible what it had been before ; she was sure he did not mean there should be any change , and that it was only her own conscience that could fancy any ; but her aunt was soon quarrelling with her ; and
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place , ” said Sir Thomas .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Oh ! ” said Mrs. Norris , with a moment ’s check , “ that was very kind of you , Sir Thomas ; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Fanny would have had quite as good a walk there , I assure you , with the advantage of being of some use , and obliging her aunt : it is all her fault .
Sir Thomas Bertram	, I have often observed it before — she likes to go her own way to work ; she does not like to be dictated to ; she takes her own independent walk whenever she can ; she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy , and independence , and nonsense , about her , which I would advise her to get the better of . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	As a general reflection on Fanny , Sir Thomas thought nothing could be more unjust , though he had been so lately expressing the same sentiments himself , and he tried to turn the conversation : tried repeatedly before he could succeed ; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment enough to perceive , either now , or at any other time , to what degree he thought well of his niece , or how very far he was from wishing to have his own children ’s merits set off by the depreciation of hers .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It was over , however , at last ; and the evening set in with more composure to Fanny , and more cheerfulness of spirits than she could have hoped for after so stormy a morning ; but she trusted , in the first place , that she had done right : that her judgment had not misled her . For the purity of her intentions she could answer ; and she was willing to hope , secondly , that her uncle ’s displeasure was abating , and would abate farther as he considered the matter with more impartiality , and felt , as a good man must feel , how wretched , and how unpardonable , how hopeless , and how wicked it was to marry without affection . When the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past , she could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally concluded , and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield , that everything would soon be as if no such subject had existed .
Sir Thomas Bertram	In London he would soon learn to wonder at his infatuation , and be thankful for the right reason in her which had saved him from its evil consequences . While Fanny ’s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes , her uncle was , soon after tea , called out of the room ; an occurrence too common to strike her , and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared ten minutes afterwards , and advancing decidedly towards herself , said , “ Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you , ma’am , in his own room . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Depend upon it , it is not you who are wanted ; depend upon it , it is me ” ( looking at the butler ) ; “ but you are so very eager to put yourself forward .
Sir Thomas Bertram	What should Sir Thomas want you for ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	You mean me , Baddeley , I am sure ; Sir Thomas wants me , not Miss Price . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	III The first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr. Norris , which happened when Fanny was about fifteen , and necessarily introduced alterations and novelties .
Sir Thomas Bertram	, removed first to the Park , and afterwards to a small house of Sir Thomas ’s in the village , and consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him ; and for her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy . The living was hereafter for Edmund ; and , had his uncle died a few years sooner , it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders .
Sir Thomas Bertram	There was another family living actually held for Edmund ; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir Thomas ’s conscience , he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice , and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction , in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been able to say or do .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I blush for you , Tom , ” said he , in his most dignified manner ; “ I blush for the expedient which I am driven on , and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It may hereafter be in my power , or in yours ( I hope it will ) , to procure him better preferment ; but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us , and that nothing can , in fact , be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow ; but escaping as quickly as possible , could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect , firstly , that he had not been half so much in debt as some of his friends ; secondly , that his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it ; and , thirdly , that the future incumbent , whoever he might be , would , in all probability , die very soon . On Mr. Norris ’s death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant , who came consequently to reside at Mansfield ; and on proving to be a hearty man of forty - five , seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram ’s calculations .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister - in - law to claim her share in their niece , the change in Mrs. Norris ’s situation , and the improvement in Fanny ’s age , seeming not merely to do away any former objection to their living together , but even to give it the most decided eligibility ; and as his own circumstances were rendered less fair than heretofore , by some recent losses on his West India estate , in addition to his eldest son ’s extravagance , it became not undesirable to himself to be relieved from the expense of her support , and the obligation of her future provision .
Sir Thomas Bertram	You have been five years with us , and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Not all her precautions , however , could save her from being suspected of something better ; or , perhaps , her very display of the importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose it really intended for Fanny .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I thought you had settled it with Sir Thomas . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas , nor he to me .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing !
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas is too much my friend .
Sir Thomas Bertram	How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	I suppose he thought it best . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ But what did he say ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	He could not say he _ wished _ me to take Fanny .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ No ; he only said he thought it very likely ; and I thought so too .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Here am I , a poor desolate widow , deprived of the best of husbands , my health gone in attending and nursing him , my spirits still worse , all my peace in this world destroyed , with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman , and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed — what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas will take care of that . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Why , you know , Sir Thomas ’s means will be rather straitened if the Antigua estate is to make such poor returns . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas has been writing about it , I know . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Well , Lady Bertram , ” said Mrs. Norris , moving to go , “ I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ;
Sir Thomas Bertram	He could not but wonder at her refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt ; but , as she took early care to make him , as well as Lady Bertram , understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family , he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which , at the same time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them , would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself . Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal ; and her spontaneous , untaught felicity on the discovery , conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas found it expedient to go to Antigua himself , for the better arrangement of his affairs , and he took his eldest son with him , in the hope of detaching him from some bad connexions at home .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light , and the hope of its utility to his son , reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the rest of his family , and of leaving his daughters to the direction of others at their present most interesting time of life .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He could not think Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them , or rather , to perform what should have been her own ; but , in Mrs. Norris ’s watchful attention , and in Edmund ’s judgment , he had sufficient confidence to make him go without fears for their conduct .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her ; but she was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety , or solicitude for his comfort , being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous , or difficult , or fatiguing to anybody but themselves .
Sir Thomas Bertram	They were relieved by it from all restraint ; and without aiming at one gratification that would probably have been forbidden by Sir Thomas , they felt themselves immediately at their own disposal , and to have every indulgence within their reach .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas , who had done so much for her and her brothers , and who was gone perhaps never to return ! that she should see him go without a tear !
Sir Thomas Bertram	He had said to her , moreover , on the very last morning , that he hoped she might see William again in the course of the ensuing winter , and had charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to be in England . “ This was so thoughtful and kind ! ” and would he only have smiled upon her , and called her “ my dear Fanny , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward , of Huntingdon , with only seven thousand pounds , had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram , of Mansfield Park , in the county of Northampton , and to be thereby raised to the rank of a baronet ’s lady , with all the comforts and consequences of an handsome house and large income .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Miss Ward ’s match , indeed , when it came to the point , was not contemptible : Sir Thomas being happily able to give his friend an income in the living of Mansfield ; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their career of conjugal felicity with very little less than a thousand a year .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas Bertram had interest , which ,
Sir Thomas Bertram	from principle as well as pride — from a general wish of doing right , and a desire of seeing all that were connected with him in situations of respectability , he would have been glad to exert for the advantage of Lady Bertram ’s sister ; but her husband ’s profession was such as no interest could reach ; and before he had time to devise any other method of assisting them , an absolute breach between the sisters had taken place .
Sir Thomas Bertram	and an answer , which comprehended each sister in its bitterness , and bestowed such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir Thomas as Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herself , put an end to all intercourse between them for a considerable period . Their homes were so distant , and the circles in which they moved so distinct , as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each other ’s existence during the eleven following years , or , at least , to make it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have it in her power to tell them , as she now and then did , in an angry voice , that Fanny had got another child .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Was there any chance of his being hereafter useful to Sir Thomas in the concerns of his West Indian property ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	No situation would be beneath him ; or what did Sir Thomas think of Woolwich ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions , Lady Bertram dispatched money and baby - linen , and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He debated and hesitated;—it was a serious charge;—a girl so brought up must be adequately provided for , or there would be cruelty instead of kindness in taking her from her family .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He thought of his own four children , of his two sons , of cousins in love , etc.;—but no sooner
Sir Thomas Bertram	he deliberately begun to state his objections , than Mrs. Norris interrupted him with a reply to them all , whether stated or not
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ My dear Sir Thomas , I perfectly comprehend you , and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions , which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct ; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one ’s own hands ; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I am sure Mr. Norris is too just — but you know I am a woman of few words and professions .
Sir Thomas Bertram	A niece of ours , Sir Thomas , I may say , or at least of _ yours _ , would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages .
Sir Thomas Bertram	You are thinking of your sons — but do not you know that , of all things upon earth , _ that _ is the least likely to happen , brought up as they would be , always together like brothers and sisters ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	But breed her up with them from this time , and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel , and she will never be more to either than a sister . ” “ There is a great deal of truth in what you say , ” replied Sir Thomas , “ and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in , and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price , and creditable to ourselves , we must secure to the child , or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter , as circumstances may arise , the provision of a gentlewoman , if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting . ” “ I thoroughly understand you , ” cried Mrs. Norris , “ you are everything that is generous and considerate , and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Whatever I can do , as you well know , I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love ; and , though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children , nor consider her , in any respect , so much my own , I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her .
Sir Thomas Bertram	My dear Sir Thomas , with all my faults I have a warm heart ; and , poor as I am , would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing .
Sir Thomas Bertram	So , if you are not against it , I will write to my poor sister tomorrow , and make the proposal ; and , as soon as matters are settled , _ I _ will engage to get the child to Mansfield ; _ you _ shall have no trouble about it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	My own trouble , you know , I never
Sir Thomas Bertram	Except to the attack on Nanny ’s cousin , Sir Thomas no longer made any objection , and a more respectable , though less economical rendezvous being accordingly substituted , everything was considered as settled , and the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The division of gratifying sensations ought not , in strict justice , to have been equal ; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and consistent patron of the selected child , and Mrs. Norris had not the least intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance .
Sir Thomas Bertram	, Mrs. Norris might never have saved her money ; but having no care of that kind , there was nothing to impede her frugality , or lessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they had never lived up to . Under this infatuating principle , counteracted by no real affection for her sister , it was impossible for her to aim at more than the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity ; though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk home to the Parsonage , after this conversation , in the happy belief of being the most liberal - minded sister and aunt in the world . When the subject was brought forward again , her views were more fully explained ; and , in reply to Lady Bertram ’s calm inquiry of “ Where shall the child come to first , sister , to you or to us ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas heard with some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris ’s power to take any share in the personal charge of her .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He had been considering her as a particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage , as a desirable companion to an aunt who had no children of her own ; but he found himself wholly mistaken .
Sir Thomas Bertram	After a short pause Sir Thomas added with dignity , “ Yes , let her home be in this house .
Sir Thomas Bertram	only wish I could be more useful ; but you see I do all in my power .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Indeed , I do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Should her disposition be really bad , ” said Sir Thomas , “ we must not , for our own children ’s sake , continue her in the family ; but there is no reason to expect so great an evil .
Sir Thomas Bertram	We shall probably see much to wish altered in her , and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance , some meanness of opinions , and very distressing vulgarity of manner ; but these are not incurable faults ; nor , I trust , can they be dangerous for her associates .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Had my daughters been _ younger _ than herself , I should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment ; but , as it is , I hope there can be nothing to fear for _ them _ , and everything to hope for _ her _ , from the association . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ That is exactly what I think , ” cried Mrs. Norris , “ and what I was saying to my husband this morning .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I hope she will not tease my poor pug , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ I have but just got Julia to leave it alone . ” “ There will be some difficulty in our way , Mrs. Norris , ” observed Sir Thomas , “ as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up : how to preserve in the minds of my _ daughters _ the consciousness of what they are , without making them think too lowly of their cousin ; and how , without depressing her spirits too far , to make her remember that she is not a _ Miss Bertram _ .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I should wish to see them very good friends , and would , on no account , authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation ; but still they can not be equals .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mrs. Norris was quite at his service ; and though she perfectly agreed with him as to its being a most difficult thing , encouraged him to hope that between them it would be easily managed .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas ’s return made a striking change in the ways of the family , independent of Lovers ’ Vows .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Under his government , Mansfield was an altered place .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas , drawing back from intimacies in general , was particularly disinclined , at this time , for any engagements but in one quarter .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The Rushworths were the only addition to his own domestic circle which he could solicit .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Edmund did not wonder that such should be his father ’s feelings , nor could he regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ But they , ” he observed to Fanny , “ have a claim .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But the truth is , that my father hardly knows them .
Sir Thomas Bertram	We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves : my sisters seem out of spirits , and Tom is certainly not at his ease .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us , and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I believe you are right , Fanny , ” was his reply , after a short consideration .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were , than assuming a new character .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before . ” “ I suppose I am graver than other people , ” said Fanny .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But when did you , or anybody , ever get a compliment from me , Fanny ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	Go to my father if you want to be complimented .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Anybody but myself would have made something more of it , and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before ; but the truth is , that your uncle never did admire you till now — and now he does .
Sir Thomas Bertram	do n’t talk so , do n’t talk so , ” cried Fanny , distressed by more feelings than he was aware of ; but seeing that she was distressed , he had done with the subject , and only added more seriously — “ Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect ; and
Sir Thomas Bertram	I only wish you would talk to him more .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I know nobody who distinguishes characters better .
Sir Thomas Bertram	And Sir Thomas ’s wishing just at first to be only with his family , is so very natural , that she can argue nothing from that .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I should dread the stupidity of the day , if there were not a much greater evil to follow — the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He can not much longer deceive himself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . ” In this quarter , indeed , disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Not all his good - will for Mr. Rushworth , not all Mr. Rushworth ’s deference for him , could prevent him from soon discerning some part of the truth — that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man , as ignorant in business as in books , with opinions in general unfixed , and without seeming much aware of it himself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He had expected a very different son - in - law ; and beginning to feel grave on Maria ’s account , tried to understand _ her _ feelings .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Little observation there was necessary to tell him that indifference was the most favourable state they could be in .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas
Sir Thomas Bertram	With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her : told her his fears , inquired into her wishes , entreated her to be open and sincere , and assured her that every inconvenience should be braved , and the connexion entirely given up , if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He would act for her and release her .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She thanked him for his great attention , his paternal kindness , but he was quite mistaken in supposing she had the smallest desire of breaking through her engagement , or was sensible of any change of opinion or inclination since her forming it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas was satisfied ; too glad to be satisfied , perhaps , to urge the matter quite so far as his judgment might have dictated to others .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It was an alliance which he could not have relinquished without pain ; and thus he reasoned .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Her feelings , probably , were not acute ; he had never supposed them to be so ; but her comforts might not be less on that account ; and if she could dispense with seeing her husband a leading , shining character
Sir Thomas Bertram	Such and such - like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas , happy to escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture , the wonder , the reflections , the reproach that must attend it ; happy to secure a marriage which would bring him such an addition of respectability and influence , and very happy to think anything of his daughter ’s disposition that was most favourable for the purpose .
Sir Thomas Bertram	To her the conference closed as satisfactorily as to him .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four days after Henry Crawford ’s leaving Mansfield , before her feelings were at all tranquillised , before she had given up every hope of him , or absolutely resolved on enduring his rival , her answer might have been different ; but after another three or four days , when there was no return , no letter , no message , no symptom of a softened heart , no hope of advantage from separation , her mind became cool enough to seek all the comfort that pride and self revenge could give .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas felt as an anxious father must feel , and was indeed experiencing much of the agitation which his wife had been apprehensive of for herself , but had fortunately escaped .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mrs. Norris , most happy to assist in the duties of the day , by spending it at the Park to support her sister ’s spirits , and drinking the health of Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth in a supernumerary glass or two , was all joyous delight ; for she had made the match ; she had done everything ; and no one would have supposed , from her confident triumph , that she had ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her life , or could have the
Sir Thomas Bertram	I will ask Sir Thomas , as soon as he comes in , whether I can do without her . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	We will ask him .
Sir Thomas Bertram	There was nothing more to be said , or that could be said to any purpose , till Sir Thomas were present ; but the subject involving , as it did , her own evening ’s comfort for the morrow , was so much uppermost in Lady Bertram ’s mind , that half an hour afterwards , on his looking in for a minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing - room , she called him back again , when he had almost closed the door , with “ Sir Thomas , stop a moment — I have something to say to you .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Her tone of calm languor , for she never took the trouble of raising her voice , was always heard and attended to ; and Sir Thomas came back .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Her story began ; and Fanny immediately slipped out of the room ; for to hear herself the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than her nerves could bear .
Sir Thomas Bertram	but if her uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding , and with very grave looks , and those grave looks directed to her , and at last decide against her , she might not be able to appear properly submissive and indifferent .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It began , on Lady Bertram ’s part , with—“I have something to tell you
Sir Thomas Bertram	will surprise you
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Well , ” said Sir Thomas , as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise . “ Edmund wants her to go .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But how can I spare her ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ She will be late , ” said Sir Thomas , taking out his watch ; “ but what is your difficulty ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	He told the whole ; and she had only to add , “ So strange ! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her . ” “ But is it not very natural , ” observed Edmund , “ that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? ” “ Nothing can be more natural , ” said Sir Thomas , after a short deliberation ; “ nor , were there no sister in the case , could anything , in my opinion , be more natural .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The only surprise I can feel is , that this should be the _ first _ time of its being paid .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But as I conclude that she must wish to go , since all young people like to be together , I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence . ” “ But can I do without her , Sir Thomas ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	” “ Indeed I think you may . ” “ She always makes tea , you know , when my sister is not here . ” “ Your sister , perhaps , may be prevailed on to spend the day with us , and I shall certainly be at home . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Well , Fanny , it is all happily settled , and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle ’s side .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He had but one opinion .
Sir Thomas Bertram	; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to anybody , and Mrs. Norris , when she came on the morrow , in consequence of an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas , was in a very ill humour , and seemed intent only on lessening her niece ’s pleasure , both present and future , as much as possible
Sir Thomas Bertram	Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to _ you _ ; the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She rated her own claims to comfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could ; and when Sir Thomas soon afterwards , just opening the door , said , “ Fanny , at what time would you have the carriage come round ? ” she felt a degree of astonishment which made it impossible for her to speak .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ My dear Sir Thomas ! ” cried Mrs. Norris , red with anger , “ Fanny can walk . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Walk ! ” repeated Sir Thomas , in a tone of most unanswerable dignity , and coming farther into the room .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ My niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year !
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Yes , sir , ” was Fanny ’s humble answer , given with the feelings almost of a criminal towards Mrs. Norris ; and not bearing to remain with her in what might seem a state of triumph , she followed her uncle out of the room , having staid behind him only long enough to hear these words spoken in angry agitation — “ Quite unnecessary !
Sir Thomas Bertram	The coachman drove round to a minute ; another minute brought down the gentleman ; and as the lady had , with a most scrupulous fear of being late , been many minutes seated in the drawing - room , Sir Thomas saw them off in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required .
Sir Thomas Bertram	What have you got on ? ” “ The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin ’s marriage .
Sir Thomas Bertram	while they were at table , such a happy flow of conversation prevailing , in which she was not required to take any part — there was so much to be said between the brother and sister about Bath , so much between the two young men about hunting , so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and Dr. Grant , and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawford and Mrs. Grant , as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to listen in quiet , and of passing a very agreeable day .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I think , Miss Price , we would have indulged ourselves with a week ’s calm in the Atlantic at that season . ” He seemed determined to be answered ; and Fanny , averting her face , said , with a firmer tone than usual , “ As far as _ I _ am concerned , sir , I would not have delayed his return for a day .
Sir Thomas Bertram	My uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive , that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough .
Sir Thomas Bertram	You must preach at Mansfield , you know , that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She was returned to Mansfield Park , she was useful , she was beloved ; she was safe from Mr. Crawford ; and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits , of his perfect approbation and increased regard ; and happy as all this must make her , she would still have been happy without any of it , for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas , poor Sir Thomas , a parent , and conscious of errors in his own conduct as a parent , was the longest to suffer .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He felt that he ought not to have allowed the marriage ; that his daughter ’s sentiments had been sufficiently known to him to render him culpable in authorising it ; that in so doing he had sacrificed the right to the expedient , and been governed by motives of selfishness and worldly wisdom .
Sir Thomas Bertram	These were reflections that required some time to soften ; but time will do almost everything ; and though little comfort arose on Mrs. Rushworth ’s side for the misery she had occasioned , comfort was to be found greater than he had supposed in his other children .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Julia ’s match became a less desperate business than he had considered it at first .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She was humble , and wishing to be forgiven ; and Mr. Yates , desirous of being really received into the family , was disposed to look up to him and be guided .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He was not very solid ; but there was a hope
Sir Thomas Bertram	of his becoming less trifling , of his being at least tolerably domestic and quiet ; and at any rate , there was comfort in finding his estate rather more , and his debts much less , than he had feared , and in being consulted and treated as the friend best worth attending to .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He became what he ought to be : useful to his father , steady and quiet , and not living merely for himself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	and quite as soon as Sir Thomas could place dependence on such sources of good , Edmund was contributing to his father ’s ease by improvement in the only point in which he had given him pain before — improvement in his spirits .
Sir Thomas Bertram	After wandering about and sitting under trees with Fanny all the summer evenings , he had so well talked his mind into submission as to be very tolerably cheerful again .
Sir Thomas Bertram	These were the circumstances and the hopes which gradually brought their alleviation to Sir Thomas , deadening his sense of what was lost , and in part reconciling him to himself ; though the anguish arising from the conviction of his own errors in the education of his daughters was never to be entirely done away .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Too late he became aware how unfavourable to the character of any young people must be the totally opposite treatment which Maria and Julia had been always experiencing at home , where the excessive indulgence and flattery of their aunt had been continually contrasted with his own severity .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He saw how ill he had judged , in expecting to counteract what was wrong in Mrs. Norris by its reverse in himself ; clearly saw that he had but increased the evil by teaching them to repress their spirits in his presence so as to make their real disposition unknown to him , and sending them for all their indulgences to a person who had been able to attach them only by the blindness of her affection , and the excess of her praise . Here had been grievous mismanagement ; but , bad as it was , he gradually grew to feel that it had not been the most direful mistake in his plan of education .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He feared that principle , active principle , had been wanting ; that they had never been properly taught to govern their inclinations and tempers by that sense of duty which can alone suffice . They had been instructed theoretically in their religion , but never required to bring it into daily practice .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He had meant them to be good , but his cares had been directed to the understanding and manners , not the disposition ; and of the necessity of self - denial and humility , he feared they had never heard from any lips that could profit them .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Bitterly did he deplore a deficiency which now he could scarcely comprehend to have been possible .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Wretchedly did he feel , that with all the cost and care of an anxious and expensive education , he had brought up his daughters without their understanding their first duties , or his being acquainted with their character and temper .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The high spirit and strong passions of Mrs. Rushworth , especially , were made known to him only in their sad result .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She was not to be prevailed on to leave Mr. Crawford .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She hoped to marry him , and they continued together till she was obliged to be convinced that such hope was vain , and till the disappointment and wretchedness arising from the conviction rendered her temper so bad , and her feelings for him so like hatred , as to make them for a while each other ’s punishment , and then induce a voluntary separation .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She had lived with him to be reproached as the ruin of all his happiness in Fanny , and carried away no better consolation in leaving him than that she _ had _ divided them .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mr. Rushworth had no difficulty in procuring a divorce ; and so ended a marriage contracted under such circumstances as to make any better end the effect of good luck not to be reckoned on .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She had despised him , and loved another ; and he had been very much aware that it was so .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His punishment followed his conduct , as did a deeper punishment the deeper guilt of his wife .
Sir Thomas Bertram	_ He _ was released from the engagement to be mortified and unhappy , till some other pretty girl could attract him into matrimony again , and he might set forward on a second , and , it is to be hoped , more prosperous trial of the state : if duped , to be duped at least with good humour and good luck ; while she must withdraw with infinitely stronger feelings to a retirement and reproach which could allow no second spring of hope or character .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas would not hear of it ; and Mrs. Norris ’s anger against Fanny was so much the greater , from considering _ her _ residence there as the motive .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She persisted in placing his scruples to _ her _ account , though Sir Thomas very solemnly assured her that , had there been no young woman in question , had there been no young person of either sex belonging to him , to be endangered by the society or hurt by the character of Mrs. Rushworth , he would never have offered so great an insult to the neighbourhood as to expect it to notice her .
Sir Thomas Bertram	As a daughter , he hoped a penitent one , she should be protected by him , and secured in every comfort , and supported by every encouragement to do right , which their relative situations admitted ; but farther than _ that _ he could not go .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Maria had destroyed her own character , and he would not , by a vain attempt to restore what never could be restored , by affording his sanction to vice , or in seeking to lessen its disgrace , be anywise accessory to introducing such misery in another man ’s family as he had known himself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mrs. Norris ’s removal from Mansfield was the great supplementary comfort of Sir Thomas ’s life .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His opinion of her had been sinking from
Sir Thomas Bertram	the day of his return from Antigua
Sir Thomas Bertram	: in every transaction together from that period , in their daily intercourse , in business , or in chat , she had been regularly losing ground in his esteem , and convincing him that either time had done her much disservice , or that he had considerably over - rated her sense , and wonderfully borne with her manners before .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He had felt her as an hourly evil , which was so much the worse , as there seemed no chance of its ceasing but with life ; she seemed a part of himself that must be borne for ever .
Sir Thomas Bertram	To be relieved from her , therefore , was so great a felicity that , had she not left bitter remembrances behind her , there might have been danger of his learning almost to approve the evil which produced such a good .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She had never been able to attach even those she loved best ; and since Mrs. Rushworth ’s elopement , her temper had been in a state of such irritation as to make her everywhere tormenting .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She had submitted the best to the disappointment in Henry Crawford .
Sir Thomas Bertram	After the first bitterness of the conviction of being slighted was over , she had been tolerably soon in a fair way of not thinking of him again ; and when the acquaintance was renewed in town , and Mr. Rushworth ’s house became Crawford ’s object , she had had the merit of withdrawing herself from it , and of chusing that time to pay a visit to her other friends , in order to secure herself from being again too much attracted .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mr. Yates ’s convenience had had nothing to do with it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She had been allowing his attentions some time , but with very little idea of ever accepting him ; and had not her sister ’s conduct burst forth as it did ,
Sir Thomas Bertram	her increased dread of her father and of home , on that event , imagining its certain consequence to herself would be greater severity and restraint , made her hastily resolve on avoiding such immediate horrors at all risks , it is probable that Mr. Yates would never have succeeded .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She had not eloped with any worse feelings than those of selfish alarm .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It had appeared to her the only thing to be done .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Henry Crawford , ruined by early independence and bad domestic example , indulged in the freaks of a cold - blooded vanity a little too long .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Once it had , by an opening undesigned and unmerited , led him into the way of happiness .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one amiable woman ’s affections , could he have found sufficient exultation in overcoming the reluctance , in working himself into the esteem and tenderness of Fanny Price , there would have been every probability of success and felicity for him .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His affection had already done something .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Her influence over him had already given him some influence over her .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Would he have deserved more , there can be no doubt that more would have been obtained , especially when that marriage had taken place , which would have given him the assistance of her conscience in subduing her first inclination , and brought them very often together .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Would he have persevered , and uprightly , Fanny must have been his reward , and a reward very voluntarily bestowed , within a reasonable period from Edmund ’s marrying Mary .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Had he done as he intended , and as he knew he ought , by going down to Everingham after his return from Portsmouth , he might have been deciding his own happy destiny .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But he was pressed to stay for Mrs. Fraser ’s party ; his staying was made of flattering consequence , and he was to meet Mrs. Rushworth there .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Curiosity and vanity were both engaged , and the temptation of immediate pleasure was too strong for a mind unused to make any sacrifice to right : he resolved to defer his Norfolk journey , resolved that writing should answer the purpose of it , or that its purpose was unimportant , and staid .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He saw Mrs. Rushworth , was received by her with a coldness which ought to have been repulsive , and have established apparent indifference between them for ever ; but he was mortified , he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose smiles had been so wholly at his command : he must exert himself to subdue so proud a display of resentment ; it was anger on Fanny ’s account ; he must get the better of it , and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram again in her treatment of himself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	In this spirit he began the attack , and by animated perseverance had soon re - established the sort of familiar intercourse , of gallantry , of flirtation , which bounded his views ; but in triumphing over the discretion which , though beginning in anger , might have saved them both , he had put himself in the power of feelings on her side more strong than he had supposed .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She loved him ; there was no withdrawing attentions avowedly dear to her .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He was entangled by his own vanity , with as little excuse of love as possible , and without the smallest inconstancy of mind towards her cousin .
Sir Thomas Bertram	To keep Fanny and the Bertrams from a knowledge of what was passing became his first object .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Secrecy could not have been more desirable for Mrs. Rushworth ’s credit than he felt it for his own .
Sir Thomas Bertram	When he returned from Richmond , he would have been glad to see Mrs. Rushworth no more .
Sir Thomas Bertram	All that followed was the result of her imprudence ; and he went off with her at last , because he could not help it , regretting Fanny even at the moment , but regretting her infinitely more when all the bustle of the intrigue was over , and a very few months had taught him , by the force of contrast , to place a yet higher value on the sweetness of her temper , the purity of her mind , and the excellence of her principles .
Sir Thomas Bertram	That punishment , the public punishment of disgrace , should in a just measure attend _ his _ share of the offence is , we know , not one of the barriers which society gives to virtue .
Sir Thomas Bertram	In this world the penalty is less equal than could be wished ; but without presuming to look forward to a juster appointment hereafter , we may fairly consider a man of sense , like Henry Crawford , to be providing for himself no small portion of vexation and regret : vexation that must rise sometimes to self - reproach , and regret to wretchedness , in having so requited hospitality , so injured family peace , so forfeited his best , most estimable , and endeared acquaintance , and so lost the woman whom he had rationally as well as passionately loved .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Dr. Grant , through an interest on which he had almost ceased to form hopes , succeeded to a stall in Westminster , which , as affording an occasion for leaving Mansfield , an excuse for residence in London , and an increase of income to answer the expenses of the change , was highly acceptable to those who went and those who staid .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mrs. Grant , with a temper to love and be loved , must have gone with some regret from the scenes and people she had been used to ; but the same happiness of disposition must in any place , and any society , secure her a great deal to enjoy , and she had again a home to offer Mary ; and Mary had had enough of her own friends , enough of vanity , ambition , love , and disappointment in the course of the last half - year , to be in need of the true kindness of her sister ’s heart , and the rational tranquillity of her ways .
Sir Thomas Bertram	They lived together ; and when Dr. Grant had brought on apoplexy and death , by three great institutionary dinners in one week , they still lived together ; for
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mary , though perfectly resolved against ever attaching herself to a younger brother again , was long in finding among the dashing representatives , or idle heir - apparents , who were at the command of her beauty , and her £ 20,000 , any one who could satisfy the better taste she had acquired at Mansfield , whose character and manners could authorise a hope of the domestic happiness she had there learned to estimate , or put Edmund Bertram sufficiently out of her head .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Edmund had greatly the advantage of her in this respect .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He had not to wait and wish with vacant affections for an object worthy to succeed her in them .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford , and observing to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such another woman , before it began to strike him whether a very different kind of woman might not do just as well , or a great deal better : whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear , as important to him in all her smiles and all her ways , as Mary Crawford had ever been ; and whether it might not be a possible , a hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love . I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion , that every one may be at liberty to fix their own , aware that the cure of unconquerable passions , and the transfer of unchanging attachments , must vary much as to time in different people .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I only entreat everybody to believe that exactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so , and not a week earlier , Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford , and became as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire .
Sir Thomas Bertram	With such a regard for her , indeed , as his had long been , a regard founded on the most endearing claims of innocence and helplessness , and completed by every recommendation of growing worth , what could be more natural than the change ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	Loving , guiding , protecting her , as he had been doing ever since her being ten years old , her mind in so great a degree formed by his care , and her comfort depending on his kindness , an object to him of such close and peculiar interest , dearer by all his own importance with her than any one else at Mansfield , what was there now to add , but that he should learn to prefer soft light eyes to sparkling dark ones .
Sir Thomas Bertram	And being always with her , and always talking confidentially , and his feelings exactly in that favourable state which a recent disappointment gives , those soft light eyes could not be very long in obtaining the pre - eminence .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Having once set out , and felt that he had done so on this road to happiness
Sir Thomas Bertram	, there was nothing on the side of prudence to stop him or make his progress slow ; no doubts of her deserving , no fears of opposition of taste , no need of drawing new hopes of happiness from dissimilarity of temper .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Even in the midst of his late infatuation , he had acknowledged Fanny ’s mental superiority .
Sir Thomas Bertram	What must be his sense of it now , therefore ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	She was of course only too good for him ; but as nobody minds having what is too good for them , he was very steadily earnest in the pursuit of the blessing , and it was not possible that encouragement from her should be long wanting .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Timid , anxious , doubting as she was , it was still impossible that such tenderness as hers should not , at times , hold out the strongest hope of success , though it remained for a later period to tell him the whole delightful and astonishing truth .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His happiness in knowing himself to have been so long the beloved of such a heart , must have been great enough to warrant any strength of language in which he could clothe it to her or to himself ; it must have been a delightful happiness .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It was a match which Sir Thomas ’s wishes had even forestalled .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sick of ambitious and mercenary connexions , prizing more and more the sterling good of principle and temper , and chiefly anxious to bind by the strongest securities all that remained to him of domestic felicity , he had pondered with genuine satisfaction on the more than possibility of the two young friends finding their natural consolation in each other for all that had occurred of disappointment to either ; and the joyful consent which met Edmund ’s application , the high sense of having realised a great acquisition in the promise of Fanny for a daughter , formed just such a contrast with his early opinion on the subject when the poor little girl ’s coming had been first agitated , as time is for ever producing between the plans and decisions of mortals , for their own instruction , and their neighbours ’ entertainment .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Fanny was indeed the daughter that he wanted .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His charitable kindness had been rearing a prime comfort for himself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His liberality had a rich repayment , and the general goodness of his intentions by her deserved it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He might have made her childhood happier ; but it had been an error of judgment only which had given him the appearance of harshness , and deprived him of her early love ; and now , on really knowing each other , their mutual attachment became very strong .
Sir Thomas Bertram	After settling her at Thornton Lacey with every kind attention to her comfort , the object of almost every day was to see her there , or to get her away from it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Selfishly dear as she had long been to Lady Bertram , she could not be parted with willingly by _ her _ .
Sir Thomas Bertram	No happiness of son or niece could make her wish the marriage .
Sir Thomas Bertram	In _ her _ usefulness , in Fanny ’s excellence , in William ’s continued good conduct and rising fame , and in the general well - doing and success of the other members of the family , all assisting to advance each other , and doing credit to his countenance and aid , Sir Thomas saw repeated , and for ever repeated , reason to rejoice in what he had done for them all , and acknowledge the advantages of early hardship and discipline , and the consciousness of being born to struggle and endure .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Equally formed for domestic life , and attached to country pleasures , their home was the home of affection and comfort ; and to complete the picture of good , the acquisition of Mansfield living , by the death of Dr. Grant , occurred just after they had been married long enough to begin to want an increase of income , and feel their distance from the paternal abode an inconvenience .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The return of Henry Crawford , and the arrival of William Price , had much to do with it , but much was still owing to Sir Thomas ’s more than toleration of the neighbourly attempts at the Parsonage .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His mind , now disengaged from the cares which had pressed on him at first , was at leisure to find the Grants and their young inmates really worth visiting ; and though infinitely above scheming or contriving for any the most advantageous matrimonial establishment that could be among the apparent possibilities of any one most dear to him , and disdaining even as a littleness the being quick - sighted on such points , he could not avoid perceiving , in a grand and careless way , that Mr. Crawford was somewhat distinguishing his niece — nor perhaps refrain ( though unconsciously ) from giving a more willing assent to invitations on that account .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His readiness , however , in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage , when the general invitation was at last hazarded , after many debates and many doubts as to whether it were worth while , “ because Sir Thomas seemed so ill inclined , and Lady Bertram was so indolent ! ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	proceeded from good - breeding and goodwill alone , and had nothing to do with Mr. Crawford , but as being one in an agreeable group : for it was in the course of that very visit that he first began to think that any one in the habit of such idle observations _ would _ _ have _ _ thought _ that Mr. Crawford was the admirer of Fanny Price .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Luckily Sir Thomas was at hand .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ What shall I do , Sir Thomas ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	Whist and speculation ; which will amuse me most ? ” Sir Thomas , after a moment ’s thought , recommended speculation .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He was a whist player himself , and perhaps might feel that it would not much amuse him to have her for a partner .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Here Fanny interposed , however , with anxious protestations of her own equal ignorance ; she had never played the game nor seen it played in her life ; and Lady Bertram felt a moment ’s indecision again ; but upon everybody ’s assuring her that nothing could be so easy , that it was the easiest game on the cards , and Henry Crawford ’s stepping forward with a most earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss Price , and teach them both , it was so settled ; and Sir Thomas , Mrs. Norris , and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime intellectual state and dignity , the remaining six , under Miss Crawford ’s direction , were arranged round the other .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It was a fine arrangement for Henry Crawford , who was close to Fanny , and with his hands full of business , having two persons ’ cards to manage as well as his own ; for though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself mistress of the rules of the game in three minutes , he had yet to inspirit her play , sharpen her avarice , and harden her heart ,
Sir Thomas Bertram	which , especially in any competition with William , was a work of some difficulty ; and as for Lady Bertram , he must continue in charge of all her fame and fortune through the whole evening ; and if quick enough to keep her from looking at her cards when the deal began , must direct her in whatever was to be done with them to the end of it
Sir Thomas Bertram	He was in high spirits , doing everything with happy ease , and preeminent in all the lively turns , quick resources , and playful impudence that could do honour to the game ; and the round table was altogether a very comfortable contrast to the steady sobriety and orderly silence of the other .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Twice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of his lady , but in vain ; no pause was long enough for the time his measured manner needed ; and very little of her state could be known till Mrs. Grant was able , at the end of the first rubber , to go to her and pay her compliments . “ I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	I am never to see my cards ; and Mr. Crawford does all the rest . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Bertram , ” said Crawford , some time afterwards , taking the opportunity of a little languor in the game , “ I have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	They had been hunting together , and were in the midst of a good run , and at some distance from Mansfield , when his horse being found to have flung a shoe , Henry Crawford had been obliged to give up , and make the best of his way back .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I told you I lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew - trees , because I can never bear to ask ; but I have not told you that , with my usual luck — for I never do wrong without gaining by it — I found myself in due time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I was suddenly , upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field , in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills ; a small stream before me to be forded , a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right — which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place , and not a gentleman or half a gentleman ’s house to be seen excepting one — to be presumed the Parsonage — within a stone ’s throw of the said knoll and church . I found myself , in short , in Thornton Lacey . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions ; though were I to answer all that you could put in the course of an hour , you would never be able to prove that it was _ not _ Thornton Lacey — for such it certainly was . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ No , I never inquire .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But I _ told _ a man mending a hedge that it was Thornton Lacey , and he agreed to it . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ You have a good memory .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I had forgotten having ever told you half so much of the place . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	You are a lucky fellow .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The farmyard must be moved , I grant you ; but I am not aware of anything else .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The house must be turned to front the east instead of the north — the entrance and principal rooms , I mean , must be on that side , where the view is really very pretty ; I am sure it may be done .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I rode fifty yards up the lane , between the church and the house , in order to look about me ; and saw how it might all be .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The meadows beyond what _ will _ _ be _ the garden , as well as what now _ is _ , sweeping round from the lane I stood in to the north - east , that is , to the principal road through the village , must be all laid together , of course ; very pretty meadows they are , finely sprinkled with timber .
Sir Thomas Bertram	They belong to the living , I suppose ; if not , you must purchase them .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Then the stream — something must be done with the stream ; but I could not quite determine what .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I had two or three ideas .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I think the house and premises may be made comfortable , and given the air of a gentleman ’s residence , without any very heavy expense , and that must suffice me ; and , I hope , may suffice all who care about me .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Another deal proceeded , and Crawford began again about Thornton Lacey .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ My plan may not be the best possible : I had not many minutes to form it in ; but you must do a good deal .
Sir Thomas Bertram	( Excuse me , your ladyship must not see your cards .
Sir Thomas Bertram	_ That _ will be done by the removal of the farmyard ; for , independent of that terrible nuisance , I never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of
Sir Thomas Bertram	( Let me see , Mary ; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for that queen ; no , no , a dozen is more than it is worth .
Sir Thomas Bertram	By some such improvements as I have suggested ( I do not really require you to proceed upon my plan , though , by the bye , I doubt anybody ’s striking out a better ) you may give it a higher character .
Sir Thomas Bertram	All this may be stamped on it ; and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road ; especially as there is no real squire ’s house to dispute the point — a circumstance , between ourselves , to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation . _ You _ think with me , I hope ” ( turning with a softened voice to Fanny ) .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Fanny gave a quick negative , and tried to hide her interest in the subject by an eager attention to her brother , who was driving as hard a bargain , and imposing on her as much as he could ; but Crawford pursued with “ No , no , you must not part with the queen .
Sir Thomas Bertram	No , no , sir , hands off , hands off .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Mr. Bertram , ” said Miss Crawford , a few minutes afterwards , “ you know Henry to be such a capital improver , that you can not possibly engage in anything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Only think how useful he was at Sotherton !
Sir Thomas Bertram	Only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in August to drive about the grounds , and see his genius take fire .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Fanny ’s eyes were turned on Crawford for a moment with an expression more than grave — even reproachful ; but on catching his , were instantly withdrawn .
Sir Thomas Bertram	With something of consciousness he shook his head at his sister , and laughingly replied , “ I can not say there was much done at Sotherton ; but it was a hot day , and we were all walking after each other , and bewildered . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	As soon as a general buzz gave him shelter , he added , in a low voice , directed solely at Fanny , “ I should be sorry to have my powers of _ planning _ judged of by the day at Sotherton .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I see things very differently now .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Do not think of me as I appeared then . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris , and being just then in the happy leisure which followed securing the odd trick by Sir Thomas ’s capital play and her own against Dr. and Mrs. Grant ’s great hands , she called out , in high good - humour , “ Sotherton !
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might depend on , when she was stopped by Sir Thomas ’s saying with authority , “ I do not advise your going to Brighton , William , as I trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting ; but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere ; and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own .
Sir Thomas Bertram	As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford ’s behaviour ; but when the whist - table broke up at the end of the second rubber , and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their last play , he became a looker - on at the other , he found his niece the object of attentions , or rather of professions , of a somewhat pointed character . Henry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about Thornton Lacey ; and not being able to catch Edmund ’s ear , was detailing it to his fair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His scheme was to rent the house himself the following winter , that he might have a home of his own in that neighbourhood ; and it was not merely for the use of it in the hunting - season ( as he was then telling her ) , though _ that _ consideration had certainly some weight , feeling as he did
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas heard and was not offended .
Sir Thomas Bertram	There was no want of respect in the young man ’s address ; and Fanny ’s reception of it was so proper and modest , so calm and uninviting , that he had nothing to censure in her .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Finding by whom he was observed , Henry Crawford addressed himself on the same subject to Sir Thomas , in a more everyday tone , but still with feeling .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I want to be your neighbour , Sir Thomas , as you have , perhaps , heard me telling Miss Price .
Sir Thomas Bertram	May I hope for your acquiescence , and for your not influencing your son against such a tenant ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas , politely bowing , replied , “ It is the only way , sir , in which I could _ not _ wish you established as a permanent neighbour ; but I hope , and believe , that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Certainly , sir , I have no idea but of residence .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But , Crawford , though I refuse you as a tenant , come to me as a friend .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ We shall be the losers , ” continued Sir Thomas .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ His going , though only eight miles , will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle ; but I should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile himself to doing less .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It is perfectly natural that you should not have thought much on the subject , Mr. Crawford .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey ; and that if he does not live among his parishioners , and prove himself , by constant attention , their well - wisher and friend , he does very little either for their good or his own . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mr. Crawford bowed his acquiescence .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I repeat again , ” added Sir Thomas , “ that Thornton Lacey is the only house in the neighbourhood in which I should _ not _ be happy to wait on Mr. Crawford as occupier . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mr. Crawford bowed his thanks .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Sir Thomas , ” said Edmund , “ undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish priest .
Sir Thomas Bertram	We must hope his son may prove that _ he _ knows it too . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Whatever effect Sir Thomas ’s little harangue might really produce on Mr. Crawford , it raised some awkward sensations in two of the others , two of his most attentive listeners — Miss Crawford and Fanny .
Sir Thomas Bertram	One of whom , having never before understood that Thornton was so soon and so completely to be his home , was pondering with downcast eyes on what it would be _ not _ to see Edmund every day ; and the other , startled from the agreeable fancies she had been previously indulging on the strength of her brother ’s description , no longer able , in the picture she had been forming of a future Thornton , to shut out the church , sink the clergyman , and see only the respectable , elegant , modernised , and occasional residence of a man of independent fortune , was considering Sir Thomas , with decided ill - will , as the destroyer of all this , and suffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his character and manner commanded , and from not daring to relieve herself by a single attempt at throwing ridicule on his cause . All the agreeable of _ her _ speculation was over for that hour .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Henry Crawford ’s chair was the first to be given a direction towards them , and he sat silently observing them for a few minutes ; himself , in the meanwhile , observed by Sir Thomas , who was standing in chat with Dr. Grant .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth , William ? ” “ No , Fanny , that I do not .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of dancing too , when I can not have you .
Sir Thomas Bertram	And I do not know that there would be any good in going to the assembly , for I might not get a partner .
Sir Thomas Bertram	You remember the Gregorys ; they are grown up amazing fine girls , but they will hardly speak to _ me _ , because Lucy is courted by a lieutenant .
Sir Thomas Bertram	My uncle says nothing , but I am sure he will do everything in his power to get you made .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Are you fond of dancing , Fanny ? ” “ Yes , very ; only I am soon tired . ” “ I should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I should like to see you dance , and I ’d dance with you if you _ would _ , for nobody would know who I was here , and I should like to be your partner once more .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I am a pretty good dancer in my way , but I dare say you are a better . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	And turning to his uncle , who was now close to them , “ Is not Fanny a very good dancer , sir ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Some very grave reproof , or at least the coldest expression of indifference , must be coming to distress her brother , and sink her to the ground .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But , on the contrary , it was no worse than , “ I am sorry to say that I am unable to answer your question .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a little girl ; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her , which , perhaps , we may have an opportunity of doing ere long . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance , Mr. Price , ” said Henry Crawford , leaning forward , “ and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject , to your entire satisfaction .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But I believe ” ( seeing Fanny looked distressed ) “ it must be at some other time .
Sir Thomas Bertram	True enough , he had once seen Fanny dance ; and it was equally true that he would now have answered for her gliding about with quiet , light elegance , and in admirable time ; but , in fact , he could not for the life of him recall what her dancing had been , and rather took it for granted that she had been present than remembered anything about her .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He passed , however , for an admirer of her dancing ; and Sir Thomas , by no means displeased , prolonged the conversation on dancing in general , and was so well engaged in describing the balls of Antigua , and listening to what his nephew could relate of the different modes of dancing which had fallen within his observation , that he had not heard his carriage announced , and was first called to the knowledge of it by the bustle of Mrs. Norris .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I can not bear to keep good old Wilcox waiting .
Sir Thomas Bertram	My dear Sir Thomas , we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you , and Edmund and William . ” Sir Thomas could not dissent , as it had been his own arrangement , previously communicated to his wife and sister ; but _ that _ seemed forgotten by Mrs. Norris , who must fancy that she settled it all herself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Fanny ’s last feeling in the visit was disappointment : for the shawl which Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round her shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford ’s quicker hand , and she was obliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas in the house !
Sir Thomas Bertram	at the moment of her appearance , Frederick was listening with looks of devotion to Agatha ’s narrative , and pressing her hand to his heart ; and as soon as she could notice this , and see that , in spite of the shock of her words , he still kept his station and retained her sister ’s hand , her wounded heart swelled again with injury , and looking as red as she had been white before , she turned out of the room , saying , “ _ I _ need not be afraid of appearing before him .
Sir Thomas Bertram	were no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer the anxious inquiry , and , encouraging him by all means to pay his respects to Sir Thomas without delay , sent him after the others with delighted haste . Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates .
Sir Thomas Bertram	on Sir Thomas ’s affection was much too humble to give her any idea of classing herself with his children , she was glad to remain behind and gain a little breathing - time .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She was nearly fainting : all her former habitual dread of her uncle was returning , and with it compassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the development before him , with solicitude on Edmund ’s account indescribable .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The ruin of the play was to them a certainty : they felt the total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand ; while Mr. Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption , a disaster for the evening , and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal being renewed after tea , when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over , and he might be at leisure to be amused by it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	he preferred remaining where he was , that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman handsomely since he _ was _ come ; and besides , he did not think it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away .
Sir Thomas Bertram	” Fanny was just beginning to collect herself , and to feel that if she staid longer behind it might seem disrespectful , when this point was settled , and being commissioned with the brother and sister ’s apology , saw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself to perform the dreadful duty of appearing before her uncle .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas was at that moment looking round him , and saying , “ But where is Fanny ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	Why do not I see my little Fanny?”—and on perceiving her , came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her , calling her his dear Fanny , kissing her affectionately , and observing with decided pleasure how much she was grown !
Sir Thomas Bertram	He had never been so kind , so _ very _ kind to her in his life .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His manner seemed changed , his voice was quick from the agitation of joy ; and all that had been awful in his dignity seemed lost in tenderness .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He led her nearer the light and looked at her again — inquired particularly after her health , and then , correcting himself , observed that he need not inquire ,
Sir Thomas Bertram	A fine blush having succeeded the previous paleness of her face , he was justified in his belief of her equal improvement in health and beauty .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He inquired next after her family , especially William : and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little , and thinking his return a misfortune ; and when , on having courage to lift her eyes to his face , she saw that he was grown thinner , and had the burnt , fagged , worn look of fatigue and a hot climate , every tender feeling was increased , and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the party , who at his suggestion now seated themselves round the fire .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He had the best right to be the talker ; and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own house , in the centre of his family , after such a separation , made him communicative and chatty in a very unusual degree ; and he was ready to give every information as to his voyage , and answer every question of his two sons almost before it was put .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His business in Antigua had latterly been prosperously rapid , and he came directly from Liverpool , having had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a private vessel , instead of waiting for the packet ; and all the little particulars of his proceedings and events , his arrivals and departures , were most promptly delivered , as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with heartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him — interrupting himself more than once , however , to remark on his good fortune in finding them all at home — coming unexpectedly as he did — all collected together exactly as he could have wished , but dared not depend on .
Sir Thomas Bertram	There was nothing disagreeable in Mr. Rushworth ’s appearance , and Sir Thomas was liking him already .
Sir Thomas Bertram	By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken , unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife , who was really extremely happy to see him , and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It was so agreeable to her to see him again , and hear him talk , to have her ear amused and her whole comprehension filled by his narratives , that she began particularly to feel how dreadfully she must have missed him , and how impossible it would have been for her to bear a lengthened absence .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Not that _ she _ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas ’s disapprobation when the present state of his house should be known , for her judgment had been so blinded that , except by the instinctive caution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth ’s pink satin cloak as her brother - in - law entered , she could hardly be said to shew any sign of alarm ; but she was vexed by the _ manner _ of his return .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Instead of being sent for out of the room , and seeing him first , and having to spread the happy news through the house , Sir Thomas , with a very reasonable dependence , perhaps , on the nerves of his wife and children , had sought no confidant but the butler , and had been following him almost instantaneously into the drawing - room .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded of an office on which she had always depended , whether his arrival or his death were to be the thing unfolded ; and was now trying to be in a bustle without having anything to bustle about , and labouring to be important where nothing
Sir Thomas Bertram	Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat , she might have gone to the housekeeper with troublesome directions , and insulted the footmen with injunctions of despatch ; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner : he would take nothing , nothing till tea came — he would rather wait for tea .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Still Mrs. Norris was at intervals urging something different ; and in the most interesting moment of his passage to England , when the alarm of a French privateer was at the height , she burst through his recital with the proposal of soup .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Sure , my dear Sir Thomas , a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas could not be provoked .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Still the same anxiety for everybody ’s comfort , my dear Mrs. Norris , ” was his answer .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ But indeed I would rather have nothing but tea . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	She carried this point , and Sir Thomas ’s narrative proceeded .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His immediate communications were exhausted , and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him , now at one , now at another of the beloved circle ; but the pause was not long : in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative , and what were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say , “ How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately , Sir
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Indeed ! and what have you been acting ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	they ’ll tell you all about it . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	You will hear enough of it to - morrow , sir .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The first day I went over Mansfield Wood , and Edmund took the copses beyond Easton , and we brought home six brace between us , and might each have killed six times as many , but
Sir Thomas Bertram	we respect your pheasants , sir , I assure you , as much as you could desire .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I hope you will take a day ’s sport there yourself , sir , soon .
Sir Thomas Bertram	For the present the danger was over , and Fanny ’s sick feelings subsided ; but when tea was soon afterwards brought in , and Sir Thomas , getting up , said that he found that he could not be any longer in the house without just looking into his own dear room
Sir Thomas Bertram	He was gone before anything had been said to prepare him for the change he must find there ; and a pause of alarm followed his disappearance .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Edmund was the first to speak — “ Something must be done , ” said he .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I will go and fetch him .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He will be no bad assistant when it all comes out . ” To the theatre he went , and reached it just in time to witness the
Sir Thomas Bertram	meeting of his father and his friend
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas had been a good deal surprised to find candles burning in his room ; and on casting his eye round it , to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general air of confusion in the furniture .
Sir Thomas Bertram	struck him especially , but he had scarcely more than time to feel astonished at all this , before there were sounds from the billiard - room to astonish him still farther .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Some one was talking there in a very loud accent ; he did not know the voice — more than talking — almost hallooing .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He stepped to the door , rejoicing at that moment in having the means of immediate communication , and , opening it , found himself on the stage of a theatre , and opposed to a ranting young man , who appeared likely to knock him down backwards .
Sir Thomas Bertram	At the very moment of Yates perceiving Sir Thomas , and giving perhaps the very best start he had ever given in the whole course of his rehearsals , Tom Bertram entered at the other end of the room ; and never had he found greater difficulty in keeping his countenance .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His father ’s looks of solemnity and amazement on this his first appearance on any stage , and the gradual metamorphosis of the impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well - bred and easy Mr. Yates , making his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram , was such an exhibition , such a piece of true acting , as he would not have lost upon any account .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It would be the last — in all probability — the last scene on that stage ; but he was sure there could not be a finer .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which was due to his own character , but was really as far from pleased with the necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner of its commencement .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mr. Yates ’s family and connexions were sufficiently known to him to render his introduction as the “ particular friend , ” another of the hundred particular friends of his son , exceedingly unwelcome ; and it needed all the felicity of being again at home , and all the forbearance it could supply , to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding himself thus bewildered in his own house , making part of a ridiculous exhibition in the midst of theatrical nonsense , and forced in so untoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young man whom he felt sure of disapproving , and whose easy indifference and volubility in the course of the first five minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of the two .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Tom understood his father ’s thoughts , and heartily wishing he might be always as well disposed to give them but partial expression , began to see , more clearly than he had ever done before , that there might be some ground of offence , that there might be some reason for the glance his father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room ; and that when he inquired with mild gravity after the fate of the billiard - table , he was not proceeding beyond a very allowable curiosity .
Sir Thomas Bertram	A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side ; and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates , as to the happiness of the arrangement , the three gentlemen returned to the drawing - room together , Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which was not lost on all
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I come from your theatre , ” said he composedly , as he sat down ; “ I found myself in it rather unexpectedly .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Its vicinity to my own room — but in every respect , indeed , it took me by surprise , as I had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It appears a neat job , however , as far as I could judge by candlelight , and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	And then he would have changed the subject , and sipped his coffee in peace over domestic matters of a calmer hue ; but Mr. Yates , without discernment to catch Sir Thomas ’s meaning , or diffidence , or delicacy , or discretion enough to allow him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the others with the least obtrusiveness himself , would keep him on the topic of the theatre , would torment him with questions and remarks relative to it , and finally would make him hear the whole history of
Sir Thomas Bertram	his disappointment at Ecclesford
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas listened most politely , but found much to offend his ideas of decorum , and confirm his ill - opinion of Mr. Yates ’s habits of thinking , from the beginning to the end of the story ; and when it was over , could give him no other assurance of sympathy than what a slight bow conveyed .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ My friend Yates brought the infection from Ecclesford , and it spread — as those things always spread , you know , sir — the faster , probably , from _ your _ having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mr. Yates took the subject from his friend as soon as possible , and immediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they had done and were doing : told him of the gradual increase of their views , the happy conclusion of their first difficulties , and present promising state of affairs ; relating everything with so blind an interest as made him not only totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many of his friends as they sat , the change of countenance , the fidget , the hem ! of unquietness , but prevented him even from seeing the expression of the face on which his own eyes were fixed — from seeing Sir Thomas ’s dark brow contract as he looked with inquiring earnestness at his daughters and Edmund , dwelling particularly on the latter , and speaking a language , a remonstrance , a reproof , which _ he _ felt at his heart .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Not less acutely was it felt by Fanny , who had edged back her chair behind her aunt ’s end of the sofa , and , screened from notice herself , saw all that was passing before her . Such a look of reproach at Edmund from his father she could never have expected to witness ; and to feel that it was in any degree deserved was an aggravation indeed .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas ’s look implied , “ On your judgment , Edmund , I depended ; what have you been about ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	She knelt in spirit to her uncle , and her bosom swelled to utter , “ Oh , not to _ him _ !
Sir Thomas Bertram	Look so to all the others , but not to _ him _ ! ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ To own the truth , Sir Thomas , we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Our company is now so dispersed , from the Crawfords being gone home , that nothing more can be done to - night ; but if you will give us the honour of your company to - morrow evening , I should not be afraid of the result .
Sir Thomas Bertram	We bespeak your indulgence , you understand , as young performers ; we bespeak your indulgence . ” “ My indulgence shall be given , sir , ” replied Sir Thomas gravely , “ but without any other rehearsal . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas did not quite understand this , and looked with some surprise at the speaker .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas looked again , and then replied with an approving smile , “ I am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It gives me sincere satisfaction .
Sir Thomas Bertram	That I should be cautious and quick - sighted , and feel many scruples which my children do _ not _ feel , is perfectly natural ; and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity , for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures , should much exceed theirs .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But at your time of life to feel all this , is a most favourable circumstance for yourself , and for everybody connected with you ; and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth ’s opinion in better words than he could find himself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He was aware that he must not expect a genius in Mr. Rushworth ; but as a well - judging , steady young man , with better notions than his elocution would do justice to , he intended to value him very highly .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mr. Rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning ; but by looking , as he really felt , most exceedingly pleased with Sir Thomas ’s good opinion , and saying scarcely anything , he did his best towards preserving that good opinion a little longer .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She had found a seat , where in excessive trembling she was enduring all these fearful thoughts , while the other three , no longer under any restraint , were giving vent to their feelings of vexation , lamenting over such an unlooked - for premature arrival as a most untoward event , and without mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been twice as long on his passage , or were still in Antigua . The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates , from better understanding the family , and judging more clearly of the mischief that must ensue .
Sir Thomas Bertram	When Sir Thomas comes , I dare say he will be in for some borough , but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing anything yet .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home , ” said Mary , after a pause .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Everything seems to depend upon Sir Thomas ’s return . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ You will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family , I assure you .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I do not think we do so well without him .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He has a fine dignified manner , which suits the head of such a house , and keeps everybody in their place .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home ; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Edmund , between his theatrical and his real part , between Miss Crawford ’s claims and his own conduct , between love and consistency , was equally unobservant ; and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company , superintending their various dresses with economical expedient , for which nobody thanked her , and saving , with delighted integrity , half a crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas , to have leisure for watching the behaviour , or guarding the happiness of his daughters .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ My dear Fanny , you feel these things a great deal too much .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I am most happy that you like the chain , and that it should be here in time for to - morrow ; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Believe me , I have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours .
Sir Thomas Bertram	No , I can safely say , I have no pleasure so complete , so unalloyed .
Sir Thomas Bertram	No , my dear Fanny , upon no account .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ She must not suppose it not wanted , not acceptable , at least : and its having been originally her brother ’s gift makes no difference ; for as she was not prevented from offering , nor you from taking it on that account , it ought not to prevent you from keeping it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ For one night , Fanny , for only one night , if it _ be _ a sacrifice ; I am sure you will , upon consideration , make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Miss Crawford ’s attentions to you have been — not more than you were justly entitled to — I am the last person to think that _ could _ _ be _ , but they have been invariable ; and to be returning them with what must have something the _ air _ of ingratitude , though I know it could never have the _ meaning _ , is not in your nature , I am sure .
Sir Thomas Bertram	This is my advice .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure , and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences , resulting principally from situation , no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She would endeavour to be rational , and to deserve the right of judging of Miss Crawford ’s character , and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound intellect and an honest heart . She had all the heroism of principle , and was determined to do her duty ; but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature , let her not be much wondered at , if , after making all these good resolutions on the side of self - government , she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund had begun writing to her , as a treasure beyond all her hopes , and reading with the tenderest emotion these words , “ My very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept ” locked it up with the chain , as the dearest part of the gift .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Thursday , predestined to hope and enjoyment , came ; and opened with more kindness to Fanny than such self - willed , unmanageable days often volunteer , for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought from Mr. Crawford to William , stating that as he found himself obliged to go to London on the morrow for a few days , he could not help trying to procure a companion ; and therefore hoped that if William could make up his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been proposed , he would accept a place in his carriage .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mr. Crawford meant to be in town by his uncle ’s accustomary late dinner - hour , and William was invited to dine with him at the Admiral ’s .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The proposal was a very pleasant one to William himself , who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses , and such a good - humoured , agreeable friend ; and , in likening it to going up with despatches , was saying at once everything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination could suggest ; and Fanny , from a different motive , was exceedingly pleased ; for the original plan was that William should go up by the mail from Northampton the following night , which would not have allowed him an hour ’s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach ; and though this offer of Mr. Crawford ’s would rob her of many hours of his company , she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of such a journey , to think of anything else .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas approved of it for another reason .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His nephew ’s introduction to Admiral Crawford might be of service .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The Admiral , he believed , had interest .
Sir Thomas Bertram	To dance without much observation or any extraordinary fatigue , to have strength and partners for about half the evening , to dance a little with Edmund , and not a great deal with Mr. Crawford , to see William enjoy himself , and be able to keep away from her aunt Norris , was the height of her ambition , and seemed to comprehend her greatest possibility of happiness .
Sir Thomas Bertram	My uncle meant it so . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	You see how it is ; and could tell me , perhaps better than I could tell you , how and why I am vexed .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Let me talk to you a little .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I have been pained by her manner this morning , and can not get the better of it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own , but the influence of her former companions makes her seem — gives to her conversation , to her professed opinions , sometimes a tinge of wrong .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She does not _ think _ evil , but she speaks it , speaks it in playfulness ; and though I know it to be playfulness , it grieves me to the soul .
Sir Thomas Bertram	They have injured the finest mind ; for sometimes , Fanny , I own to you , it does appear more than manner : it appears as if the mind itself was tainted . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford ’s note to William had worn away , she had been in a state absolutely the reverse ; there had been no comfort around , no hope within her .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mr. Crawford had , as he foretold , been very punctual , and short and pleasant had been the meal .
Sir Thomas Bertram	After seeing William to the last moment , Fanny walked back to the breakfast - room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy change ; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace , conceiving , perhaps , that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her tender enthusiasm , and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in William ’s plate might but divide
Sir Thomas Bertram	with the broken egg - shells in Mr. Crawford ’s
Sir Thomas Bertram	She sat and cried _ con _ _ amore _ as her uncle intended , but it was _ con _ _ amore _ fraternal and no other .
Sir Thomas Bertram	; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be . ” And these were her longest speeches and clearest communications : the rest was only a languid “ Yes , yes ; very well ; did you ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	The cards were brought , and Fanny played at cribbage with her aunt till bedtime ; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself , no sounds were heard in the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the game—“And _ that _ makes thirty - one ; four in hand and eight in crib .
Sir Thomas Bertram	You are to deal , ma’am ; shall I deal for you ? ” Fanny thought and thought again of the difference which twenty - four hours had made in that room , and all that part of the house .
Sir Thomas Bertram	she was thankful that she could now sit in the same room with her uncle , hear his voice , receive his questions , and even answer them , without such wretched feelings as she had formerly known . “ We miss our two young men , ” was Sir Thomas ’s observation on both the first and second day , as they formed their very reduced circle after dinner ; and in consideration of Fanny ’s swimming eyes , nothing more was said on the first day than to drink their good health ; but on the second it led to something farther .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ And there is no reason to suppose , ” added Sir Thomas , “ but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent .
Sir Thomas Bertram	This wish was levelled principally at Julia , who had just applied for permission to go to town with Maria ; and as Sir Thomas thought it best for each daughter that the permission should be granted , Lady Bertram , though in her own good - nature she would not have prevented it , was lamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia ’s return , which would otherwise have taken place about this time .
Sir Thomas Bertram	followed on Sir Thomas ’s side , tending to reconcile his wife to the arrangement .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm “ Yes ” ; and at the end of a quarter of an hour ’s silent consideration spontaneously observed , “ Sir Thomas , I have been thinking — and I am very glad we took Fanny
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding , “ Very true . We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face , she is now a very valuable companion .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas paused , half smiled , glanced at his niece , and then gravely replied , “ She will never leave us , I hope , till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here . ” “ And _ that _ is not very likely to be , Sir Thomas .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He could not have devised anything more likely to raise his consequence than this week ’s absence , occurring as it did at the very time of her brother ’s going away , of William Price ’s going too , and completing the sort of general break - up of a party which had been so animated .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His friend Mr. Owen had sisters ; he might find them attractive .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ He did not , the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Who could write chat to Sir Thomas ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mr. Crawford gone , Sir Thomas ’s next object was that he should be missed ; and he entertained great hope that his niece would find a blank in the loss of those attentions which at the time she had felt , or fancied , an evil .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She had tasted of consequence in its most flattering form ; and he did hope that the loss of it , the sinking again into nothing , would awaken very wholesome regrets in her mind .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He watched her with this idea ; but he could hardly tell with what success .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He hardly knew whether there were any difference in her spirits or not .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She was always so gentle and retiring that her emotions were beyond his discrimination .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He did not understand her : he felt that he did not ; and therefore applied to Edmund to tell him how she stood affected on the present occasion , and whether she were more or less happy than she had been .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Edmund did not discern any symptoms of regret , and thought his father a little unreasonable in supposing the first three or four days could produce any .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But as such were Fanny ’s persuasions , she suffered very much from them , and could never speak of Miss Crawford without pain . Sir Thomas , meanwhile , went on with his own hopes and his own observations , still feeling a right , by all his knowledge of human nature , to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and consequence on his niece ’s spirits , and the past attentions of the lover producing a craving for their return ; and he was soon afterwards able to account for his not yet completely and indubitably seeing all this , by the prospect of another visitor , whose approach he could allow to be quite enough to support the spirits he was watching .
Sir Thomas Bertram	So reasoned Edmund , till his father made him the confidant of a scheme which placed Fanny ’s chance of seeing the second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush in all his glory in another light .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It had occurred to Sir Thomas , in one of his dignified musings , as a right and desirable measure ; but before he absolutely made up his mind , he consulted his son .
Sir Thomas Bertram	This was enough to determine Sir Thomas ; and a decisive “ then so it shall be ” closed that stage of the business ; Sir Thomas retiring
Sir Thomas Bertram	from it with some feelings of satisfaction , and views of good over and above what he had communicated to his son
Sir Thomas Bertram	; for his prime motive in sending her away had very little to do with the propriety of her seeing her parents again , and nothing at all with any idea of making her happy .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He certainly wished her to go willingly , but he as certainly wished her to be heartily sick of home before her visit ended ; and that a little abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of Mansfield Park would bring her mind into a sober state , and incline her to a juster estimate of the value of that home of greater permanence , and equal comfort , of which she had the offer .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It was a medicinal project upon his niece ’s understanding , which he must consider as at present diseased .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Her father ’s house would , in all probability , teach her the value of a good income ; and he trusted that she would be the wiser and happier woman , all her life , for the experiment he had devised . Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures
Sir Thomas Bertram	, she must have had a strong attack of them when she first understood what was intended , when her uncle first made her the offer of visiting the parents , and brothers , and sisters , from whom she had been divided almost half her life ; of returning for a couple of months to the scenes of her infancy , with William for the protector and companion of her journey , and the
Sir Thomas Bertram	She was of use to no one else ; but _ there _ she might be missed to a degree that she did not like to think of ; and that part of the arrangement was , indeed , the hardest for Sir Thomas to accomplish , and what only _ he _ could have accomplished at all
Sir Thomas Bertram	But he was master at Mansfield Park .
Sir Thomas Bertram	When he had really resolved on any measure , he could always carry it through ; and now by dint of long talking on the subject , explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny ’s sometimes seeing her family
Sir Thomas Bertram	, he did induce his wife to let her go ; obtaining it rather from submission , however , than conviction , for Lady
Sir Thomas Bertram	was convinced of very little more than that Sir Thomas thought Fanny ought to go , and therefore that she must .
Sir Thomas Bertram	, in the impartial flow of her own meditations , unbiased by his bewildering statements , she could not acknowledge any necessity for Fanny ’s ever going near a father and mother who had done without her so long , while she was so useful to herself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	And as to the not missing her , which under Mrs. Norris ’s discussion was the point attempted to be proved , she set herself very steadily against admitting any such thing . Sir Thomas had appealed to her reason , conscience , and dignity .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He called it a sacrifice , and demanded it of her goodness and self - command as such .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I do not know how it is , ” said he ; “ but we seem to want some of your nice ways and orderliness at my father ’s .
Sir Thomas Bertram	By the time Mrs. Price ’s answer arrived , there remained but a very few days more to be spent at Mansfield ; and for part of one of those days the young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of their journey , for when the mode of it came to be talked of , and Mrs. Norris found that all her anxiety to save her brother - in - law ’s money was vain , and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less expensive conveyance of Fanny , they were to travel post ; when she saw Sir Thomas actually give William notes for the purpose , she was struck with the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage , and suddenly seized with a strong inclination to go with them , to go and see her poor dear sister Price .
Sir Thomas Bertram	that she could not possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present ; that she was a great deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram for her to be able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a week , and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to that of being useful to them .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He had intended , about this time , to be going to London ; but he could not leave his father and mother just when everybody else of most importance to their comfort was leaving them ; and with an effort , felt but not boasted of , he delayed for a week or two longer a journey which he was looking forward to with the hope of its fixing his happiness for ever .
Sir Thomas Bertram	how you did tremble when Sir Thomas first had you put on ! ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	The being left with her sister and nephew , and all the house under her care , had been an advantage entirely thrown away
Sir Thomas Bertram	Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not have happened .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Lady Bertram did not think deeply , but , guided by Sir Thomas , she thought justly on all important points ; and she saw , therefore , in all its enormity , what had happened , and neither endeavoured herself , nor required Fanny to advise her , to think little of guilt and infamy .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Her aunt was no very methodical narrator , but with the help of some letters to and from Sir Thomas , and what she already knew herself , and could reasonably combine , she was soon able to understand quite as much as she wished of the circumstances attending the story .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mrs. Rushworth had gone , for the Easter holidays , to Twickenham , with a family whom she had just grown intimate with : a family of lively , agreeable manners , and probably of morals and discretion to suit , for to _ their _ house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His having been in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mr. Rushworth had been gone at this time to Bath , to pass a few days with his mother , and bring her back to town , and Maria was with these friends without any restraint , without even Julia ; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Street two or three weeks before , on a visit to some relations of Sir Thomas ; a removal which her father and mother were now disposed to attribute to some view of convenience on Mr. Yates ’s account . Very soon after the Rushworths ’ return to Wimpole Street , Sir Thomas had received a letter from an old and most particular friend in London , who hearing and witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter , wrote to recommend Sir Thomas ’s coming to London himself , and using his influence with his daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already exposing her to unpleasant remarks , and evidently making Mr. Rushworth uneasy . Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter , without communicating its contents to any creature at Mansfield , when it was followed by another , sent express from the same friend , to break to him the almost desperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas set off , Edmund would go with him , and the others had been left in a state of wretchedness , inferior only to what followed the receipt of the next letters from London .
Sir Thomas Bertram	might perhaps arise almost as much from the personal disrespect with which she had herself been treated as from sensibility for her son .
Sir Thomas Bertram	But had she been less obstinate , or of less weight with her son , who was always guided by the last speaker , by the person who could get hold of and shut him up , the case would still have been hopeless , for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear again , and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealed somewhere with Mr. Crawford , who had quitted his uncle ’s house , as for a journey , on the very day of her absenting herself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Sir Thomas , however , remained yet a little longer in town , in the hope of discovering and snatching her from farther vice , though all was lost on the side of character . _ His _ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of .
Sir Thomas Bertram	There was but one of his children who was not at this time a source of misery to him .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Tom ’s complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his sister ’s conduct , and his recovery so much thrown back by it , that even Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference , and all her alarms were regularly sent off to her husband ; and Julia ’s elopement , the additional blow which had met him on his arrival in London , though its force had been deadened at the moment , must , she knew , be sorely felt . She saw that it was .
Sir Thomas Bertram	His letters expressed how much he deplored it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He called it a bad thing , done in the worst manner , and at the worst time ; and though Julia was yet as more pardonable than Maria as folly than vice , he could not but regard the step she had taken as opening the worst probabilities of a conclusion hereafter like her sister ’s .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Such was his opinion of the set into which she had thrown herself .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Fanny felt for him most acutely .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mr. Crawford would have fully acquitted her conduct in refusing him ; but this , though most material to herself , would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It was of a much less poignant nature than what the others excited ; but Sir Thomas was considering his happiness as very deeply involved in the offence of his sister and friend ; cut off by it , as he must be , from the woman whom he had been pursuing with undoubted attachment and strong probability of success ; and who , in everything but this despicable brother , would have been so eligible a connexion
Sir Thomas Bertram	He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf , in addition to all the rest , when they were in town : he had seen or conjectured his feelings ; and , having reason to think that one interview with Miss Crawford had taken place , from which Edmund derived only increased distress , had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him out of town , and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt , with a view to his relief and benefit , no less than theirs .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Fanny was not in the secret of her uncle ’s feelings , Sir Thomas not in the secret of Miss Crawford ’s character . Had he been privy to her conversation with his son , he would not have wished her to belong to him , though her twenty thousand pounds had been forty .
Sir Thomas Bertram	With a graver look and voice she then added , ‘ I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister ’s expense . ’
Sir Thomas Bertram	She reprobated her brother ’s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for , to do what must lose him the woman he adored ; but still more the folly of poor Maria , in sacrificing such a situation , plunging into such difficulties , under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The want of common discretion , of caution : his going down to Richmond for the whole time of her being at Twickenham ; her putting herself in the power of a servant ; it was the detection , in short — oh , Fanny ! it was the detection , not the offence , which she reprobated .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It was the imprudence which had brought things to extremity , and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her .
Sir Thomas Bertram	‘ He has thrown away , ’ said she , ‘ such a woman as he will never see again .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She would have fixed him ; she would have made him happy for ever . ’
Sir Thomas Bertram	She spoke of you with high praise and warm affection ; yet , even here , there was alloy , a dash of evil ; for in the midst of it she could exclaim , ‘ Why would not she have him ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	Had she accepted him as she ought , they might now have been on the point of marriage , and Henry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He would have taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again .
Sir Thomas Bertram	At such a moment to give way to gaiety , to speak with lightness , and to you !
Sir Thomas Bertram	I told her so . ” “ Did you ? ” “ Yes ; when I left her I told her so . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ ‘ We must persuade Henry to marry her , ’ said she ; ‘ and what with honour , and the certainty of having shut himself out for ever from Fanny , I do not despair of it . Fanny he must give up .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I do not think that even _ he _ could now hope to succeed with one of her stamp , and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable difficulty .
Sir Thomas Bertram	If by any officious exertions of his , she is induced to leave Henry ’s protection , there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I know how he is likely to be influenced .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour and compassion , and it may all end well ; but if he get his daughter away , it will be destroying the chief hold . ’
Sir Thomas Bertram	That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister ( with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say ) , but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself ,
Sir Thomas Bertram	giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past .
Sir Thomas Bertram	‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she , with a smile ; but it was a smile ill - suited to the conversation that had passed , a saucy playful smile , seeming to invite in order to subdue me ; at least it appeared so to me .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Equally in brother and sister deceived !
Sir Thomas Bertram	Till that happened , they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone , and how she had attached him , and how delightful nature had made her , and how excellent she would have been , had she fallen into good hands earlier .
Sir Thomas Bertram	submitted to believe that Tom ’s illness had influenced her , only reserving for himself this consoling thought , that considering the many counteractions of opposing habits , she had certainly been _ more _ attached to him than could have been expected , and for his sake been more near doing right .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She looked about her with due consideration , and found almost everything in his favour : a park , a real park , five miles round , a spacious modern - built house , so well placed and well screened as to deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen ’s seats in the kingdom , and wanting only to be completely new furnished — pleasant sisters , a quiet mother , and an agreeable man himself — with the advantage of being tied up from much gaming at present by a promise to his father , and of being Sir Thomas hereafter .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Those who are showing the world what female manners _ should _ be , ” said Mr. Bertram gallantly , “ are doing a great deal to set them right . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Yes , _ that _ is very inconvenient indeed , ” said Mr. Bertram .
Sir Thomas Bertram	The close bonnet and demure air you describe so well ( and nothing was ever juster ) , tell one what is expected ; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them .
Sir Thomas Bertram	I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September , just after my return from the West Indies .
Sir Thomas Bertram	My friend Sneyd
Sir Thomas Bertram	— you have heard me speak of Sneyd , Edmund — his father , and mother , and sisters , were there , all new to me .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She was almost at the door , and not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain , she still went on , after a civil reception , a short sentence about being waited for , and a “ Let Sir Thomas know ” to the servant .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She had burst away from him , and at that moment Sir Thomas was heard speaking to a servant in his way towards the room they were in .
Sir Thomas Bertram	It was no time for farther assurances or entreaty , though to part with her at a moment when her modesty alone seemed , to his sanguine and preassured mind , to stand in the way of the happiness he sought , was a cruel necessity .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She rushed out at an opposite door from the one her uncle was approaching , and was walking up and down the East room in the utmost confusion of contrary feeling , before Sir Thomas ’s politeness or apologies were over , or he had reached the beginning of the joyful intelligence which his visitor came to communicate .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He was inexcusable , incomprehensible !
Sir Thomas Bertram	But such were his habits that he could do nothing without a mixture of evil .
Sir Thomas Bertram	He had previously made her the happiest of human beings , and now he had insulted — she knew not what to say , how to class , or how to regard it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She would not have him be serious , and yet what could excuse the use of such words and offers , if they meant but to trifle ?
Sir Thomas Bertram	Thomas was as joyful as she could desire , and very kind and communicative ; and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William as to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her , till she found , towards the close , that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and dine there that very day .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Her comfort in that day ’s dinner was quite destroyed : she could hardly eat anything ; and when Sir Thomas good - humouredly observed that joy had taken away her appetite
Sir Thomas Bertram	She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever , and began to be in despair of ever getting away ; but at last they were in the drawing - room , and she was able to think as she would , while her aunts finished the subject of William ’s appointment in their own style .
Sir Thomas Bertram	Mrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving it would be to Sir Thomas as with any part of it .
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Sir Thomas told me £ 10 would be enough . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	Now , here are my sister Price ’s children ; take them all together , I dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year , to say nothing of what _ I _ do for them .
Sir Thomas Bertram	they can not help it ; and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She had quite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas and Mr. Crawford joined them .
Sir Thomas Bertram	She fancied he was trying for it the whole evening at intervals , whenever Sir Thomas was out of the room , or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris , and she carefully refused him every opportunity .
William Price	He was now the Mr. Crawford who was addressing herself with ardent , disinterested love ; whose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and upright , whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of attachment ; who was pouring out his sense of her merits , describing and describing again his affection , proving as far as words could prove it , and in the language , tone , and spirit of a man of talent too , that he sought her for her gentleness and her goodness ; and to complete the whole , he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William ’s promotion ! Here was a change , and here were claims which could not but operate !
William Price	Good sense , like hers , will always act when really called upon ; and she found that she had been able to name him to her mother , and recall her remembrance of the name , as that of “ William ’s friend , ” though she could not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable at such a moment .
William Price	The consciousness of his being known there only as William ’s friend
William Price	Warmed by the sight of such a friend to her son , and regulated by the wish of appearing to advantage before him , she was overflowing with gratitude — artless , maternal gratitude — which could not be unpleasing .
William Price	They talked of William , a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire ; and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart could wish .
William Price	But Tom ’s extravagance had , previous to that event , been so great as to render a different disposal of the next presentation necessary , and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder .
William Price	He had said to her , moreover , on the very last morning , that he hoped she might see William again in the course of the ensuing winter , and had charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to be in England . “ This was so thoughtful and kind ! ” and would he only have smiled upon her , and called her “ my dear Fanny , ”
William Price	while he said it , every former frown or cold address might have been forgotten .
William Price	But he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification , by adding , “ If William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . ”
William Price	She cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle was gone ; and her cousins , on seeing her with red eyes , set her down as a hypocrite .
William Price	XXXV Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse whether her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned between them or not ; and that if she did not lead the way , it should never be touched on by him ; but after a day or two of mutual reserve , he was induced by his father to change his mind , and try what his influence might do for his friend .
William Price	Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business ; he wanted to know Fanny ’s feelings .
William Price	She had been used to consult him in every difficulty , and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her confidence now ; he hoped to be of service to her , he thought he must be of service to her ; whom else had she to open her heart to ?
William Price	Fanny estranged from him , silent and reserved , was an unnatural state of things ; a state which he must break through , and which he could easily learn to think she was wanting him to break through .
William Price	But how could you possibly suppose me against you ?
William Price	How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love ?
William Price	Were I even careless in general on such matters , how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake ? ” “ My uncle thought me wrong , and I knew he had been talking to you . ” “ As far as you have gone , Fanny , I think you perfectly right .
William Price	“ My dear Fanny , ” replied Edmund , scarcely hearing her to the end , “ let us not , any of us , be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly .
William Price	The time of the play is a time which I hate to recollect .
William Price	Maria was wrong , Crawford was wrong , we were all wrong together ; but none so wrong as myself
William Price	Compared with me , all the rest were blameless .
William Price	I was playing the fool with my eyes open .
William Price	It proves him , in short , everything that I had been used to wish to believe him , and feared he was not .
William Price	She is hurt , as you would be for William ; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart .
William Price	“ Poor William !
William Price	He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the Antwerp
William Price	which , especially in any competition with William , was a work of some difficulty ; and as for Lady Bertram , he must continue in charge of all her fame and fortune through the whole evening ; and if quick enough to keep her from looking at her cards when the deal began , must direct her in whatever was to be done with them to the end of it
William Price	Thornton Lacey was the name of his impending living , as Miss Crawford well knew ; and her interest in a negotiation for William Price ’s knave increased .
William Price	” Miss Crawford , a little suspicious and resentful of a certain tone of voice , and a certain half - look attending the last expression of his hope , made a hasty finish of her dealings with William Price ; and securing his knave at an exorbitant rate , exclaimed , “ There , I will stake my last like a woman of spirit .
William Price	You have bought her too dearly , and your brother does not offer half her value .
William Price	“ And Fanny had much rather it were William ’s , ” said Edmund , smiling at her .
William Price	William , you are quite out of luck ; but the next time you come , I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at home , and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly
William Price	Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations , and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man .
William Price	They are at Brighton now , you know ; in one of the best houses there , as Mr. Rushworth ’s fine fortune gives them a right to be .
William Price	I do not exactly know the distance , but when you get back to Portsmouth , if it is not very far off , you ought to go over and pay your respects to them ; and I could send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your cousins .
William Price	Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might depend on , when she was stopped by Sir Thomas ’s saying with authority , “ I do not advise your going to Brighton , William , as I trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting ; but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere ; and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own .
William Price	“ I would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than anything else , ” was William ’s only answer , in an undervoice , not meant to reach far , and the subject dropped .
William Price	that , in spite of all Dr. Grant ’s very great kindness , it was impossible for him and his horses to be accommodated where they now were without material inconvenience ; but his attachment to that neighbourhood did not depend upon one amusement or one season of the year : he had set his heart upon having a something there that he could come to at any time , a little homestall at his command , where all the holidays of his year might be spent , and he might find himself continuing , improving , and
William Price	_ perfecting _ that friendship and intimacy with the Mansfield Park family which was increasing in value to him every day .
William Price	There was no want of respect in the young man ’s address ; and Fanny ’s reception of it was so proper and modest , so calm and uninviting , that he had nothing to censure in her .
William Price	She said little , assented only here and there , and betrayed no inclination either of appropriating any part of the compliment to herself , or of strengthening his views in favour of Northamptonshire .
William Price	May I hope for your acquiescence , and for your not influencing your son against such a tenant ? ”
William Price	But , Crawford , though I refuse you as a tenant , come to me as a friend .
William Price	Consider the house as half your own every winter , and we will add to the stables on your own improved plan , and with all the improvements of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring . ”
William Price	“ His going , though only eight miles , will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle ; but I should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile himself to doing less .
William Price	It is perfectly natural that you should not have thought much on the subject , Mr. Crawford .
William Price	We must hope his son may prove that _ he _ knows it too . ”
William Price	One of whom , having never before understood that Thornton was so soon and so completely to be his home , was pondering with downcast eyes on what it would be _ not _ to see Edmund every day ; and the other , startled from the agreeable fancies she had been previously indulging on the strength of her brother ’s description , no longer able , in the picture she had been forming of a future Thornton , to shut out the church , sink the clergyman , and see only the respectable , elegant , modernised , and occasional residence of a man of independent fortune , was considering Sir Thomas , with decided ill - will , as the destroyer of all this , and suffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his character and manner commanded , and from not daring to relieve herself by a single attempt at throwing ridicule on his cause . All the agreeable of _ her _ speculation was over for that hour .
William Price	William and Fanny were the most detached .
William Price	“ This is the assembly night , ” said William .
William Price	“ If I were at Portsmouth I should be at it , perhaps .
William Price	“ But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth , William ? ” “ No , Fanny , that I do not .
William Price	But never mind it , William ” ( her own cheeks in a glow of indignation as she spoke ) .
William Price	It is no reflection on _ you _ ; it is no more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced , more or less , in their time .
William Price	You must think of that , you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which fall to every sailor ’s share , like bad weather and hard living , only with this advantage , that there will be an end to it , that there will come a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure .
William Price	When you are a lieutenant !
William Price	only think , William , when you are a lieutenant , how little you will care for any nonsense of this kind . ”
William Price	“ I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant , Fanny .
William Price	Everybody gets made but me .
William Price	my dear William , do not talk so ; do not be so desponding .
William Price	My uncle says nothing , but I am sure he will do everything in his power to get you made .
William Price	He knows , as well as you do , of what consequence it is . ”
William Price	And turning to his uncle , who was now close to them , “ Is not Fanny a very good dancer , sir ? ”
William Price	He passed , however , for an admirer of her dancing ; and Sir Thomas , by no means displeased , prolonged the conversation on dancing in general , and was so well engaged in describing the balls of Antigua , and listening to what his nephew could relate of the different modes of dancing which had fallen within his observation , that he had not heard his carriage announced , and was first called to the knowledge of it by the bustle of Mrs. Norris .
William Price	My dear Sir Thomas , we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you , and Edmund and William . ” Sir Thomas could not dissent , as it had been his own arrangement , previously communicated to his wife and sister ; but _ that _ seemed forgotten by Mrs. Norris , who must fancy that she settled it all herself .
William Price	He inquired next after her family , especially William : and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little , and thinking his return a misfortune ; and when , on having courage to lift her eyes to his face , she saw that he was grown thinner , and had the burnt , fagged , worn look of fatigue and a hot climate , every tender feeling was increased , and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him .
William Price	You will find the beginning of a note to yourself ; but I can now speak my business , which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle — a chain for William ’s cross .
William Price	“ She must not suppose it not wanted , not acceptable , at least : and its having been originally her brother ’s gift makes no difference ; for as she was not prevented from offering , nor you from taking it on that account , it ought not to prevent you from keeping it .
William Price	The chain will agree with William ’s cross beyond all comparison better than the necklace . ”
William Price	Wear the necklace , as you are engaged to do , to - morrow evening , and let the chain , which was not ordered with any reference to the ball , be kept for commoner occasions .
William Price	Thursday , predestined to hope and enjoyment , came ; and opened with more kindness to Fanny than such self - willed , unmanageable days often volunteer , for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought from Mr. Crawford to William , stating that as he found himself obliged to go to London on the morrow for a few days , he could not help trying to procure a companion ; and therefore hoped that if William could make up his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been proposed , he would accept a place in his carriage .
William Price	Mr. Crawford meant to be in town by his uncle ’s accustomary late dinner - hour , and William was invited to dine with him at the Admiral ’s .
William Price	The proposal was a very pleasant one to William himself , who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses , and such a good - humoured , agreeable friend ; and , in likening it to going up with despatches , was saying at once everything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination could suggest ; and Fanny , from a different motive , was exceedingly pleased ; for the original plan was that William should go up by the mail from Northampton the following night , which would not have allowed him an hour ’s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach ; and though this offer of Mr. Crawford ’s would rob her of many hours of his company , she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of such a journey , to think of anything else .
William Price	His nephew ’s introduction to Admiral Crawford might be of service .
William Price	Fanny ’s spirits lived on it half the morning , deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being himself to go away .
William Price	To dance without much observation or any extraordinary fatigue , to have strength and partners for about half the evening , to dance a little with Edmund , and not a great deal with Mr. Crawford , to see William enjoy himself , and be able to keep away from her aunt Norris , was the height of her ambition , and seemed to comprehend her greatest possibility of happiness .
William Price	William , determined to make this last day a day of thorough enjoyment , was out snipe - shooting ;
William Price	Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford ’s note to William had worn away , she had been in a state absolutely the reverse ; there had been no comfort around , no hope within her .
William Price	William ’s good fortune returned again upon her mind , and seemed of greater value than at first .
William Price	His , therefore , must be worn ; and having , with delightful feelings , joined the chain and the cross — those memorials of the two most beloved of her heart , those dearest tokens so formed for each other by everything real and imaginary — and put them round her neck , and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were , she was able , without an effort , to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford ’s necklace too .
William Price	The ball was over , and the breakfast was soon over too ; the last kiss was given , and William was gone .
William Price	After seeing William to the last moment , Fanny walked back to the breakfast - room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy change ; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace , conceiving , perhaps , that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her tender enthusiasm , and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in William ’s plate might but divide
William Price	William was gone , and she now felt as if she had wasted half his visit in idle cares and selfish solicitudes unconnected with him .
William Price	Fanny ’s disposition was such that she could never even think of her aunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own small house , without reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her when they had been last together ; much less could her feelings acquit her of having done and said and thought everything by William that was due to him for a whole fortnight . It was a heavy , melancholy day .
William Price	Soon after the second breakfast , Edmund bade them good - bye for a week , and mounted his horse for Peterborough , and then all were gone .
William Price	“ She could not recollect what it was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes , or what it was that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny : she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finest young man in the room — somebody had whispered something to her
William Price	did he ?
William Price	She could think of William the next day more cheerfully ; and as the morning afforded her an opportunity of talking over Thursday night with Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford , in a very handsome style , with all the heightenings of imagination , and all the laughs of playfulness which are so essential to the shade of a departed ball , she could afterwards bring her mind without much effort into its everyday state , and easily conform to the tranquillity of the present quiet week . They were indeed a smaller party than she had ever known there for a whole day together , and _ he _ was gone on whom the comfort and cheerfulness of every family meeting and every meal chiefly depended .
William Price	He would soon be always gone ; and
William Price	William was kindly commended and his promotion hoped for .
William Price	“ And there is no reason to suppose , ” added Sir Thomas , “ but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent .
William Price	As to Edmund , we must learn to do without him .
William Price	This will be the last winter of his belonging to us , as he has done .
William Price	“ Yes , ” said Lady Bertram , “ but I wish he was not going away .
William Price	Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her .
William Price	In some points of interest they were exactly opposed to each other . To Fanny ’s mind , Edmund ’s absence was really , in its cause and its tendency , a relief .
William Price	She felt the want of his society every day , almost every hour , and was too much in want of it to derive anything but irritation from considering the object for which he went .
William Price	Angry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions , and acting on them in defiance of her ( and she had been so angry that they had hardly parted friends at the ball ) , she could not help thinking of him continually when absent , dwelling on his merit and affection , and longing again for the almost daily meetings they lately had .
William Price	His absence was unnecessarily long .
William Price	He should not have planned such an absence — he should not have left home for a week , when her own departure from Mansfield was so near .
William Price	All this was bad , but she had still more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund ; when Saturday came and still no Edmund ; and when , through the slight communication with the other family which Sunday produced , she learned that he had actually written home to defer his return , having promised to remain some days longer with his friend . If she had felt impatience and regret before — if she had been sorry for what she said , and feared its too strong effect on him — she now felt and feared it all tenfold more .
William Price	His friend Mr. Owen had sisters ; he might find them attractive .
William Price	But , at any rate , his staying away at a time when , according to all preceding plans , she was to remove to London , meant something that she could not bear .
William Price	You must miss him .
William Price	Does his staying longer surprise you ? ”
William Price	“ Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of .
William Price	“ He did not , the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before .
William Price	“ He finds the house more agreeable _ now _ .
William Price	He is a very — a very pleasing young man himself , and I can not help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London , as will now undoubtedly be the case .
William Price	If she could have believed Mary ’s future fate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother ’s should be , if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant as she was much inclined to think his , she would have been light of heart indeed ; but the more she recollected and observed , the more deeply was she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for Miss Crawford ’s marrying Edmund than it had ever been before .
William Price	On his side the inclination was stronger , on hers less equivocal .
William Price	His objections , the scruples of his integrity , seemed all done away , nobody could tell how ; and the doubts and hesitations of her ambition were equally got over — and equally without apparent reason .
William Price	His good and her bad feelings yielded to love , and such love must unite them .
William Price	He was to go to town as soon as some business relative to Thornton Lacey were completed — perhaps within a fortnight ; he talked of going , he loved to talk of it ; and when once with her again , Fanny could not doubt the rest .
William Price	Her acceptance must be as certain as his offer ; and yet there were bad feelings still remaining which made the prospect of it most sorrowful to her , independently , she believed , independently of self .
William Price	But as such were Fanny ’s persuasions , she suffered very much from them , and could never speak of Miss Crawford without pain . Sir Thomas , meanwhile , went on with his own hopes and his own observations , still feeling a right , by all his knowledge of human nature , to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and consequence on his niece ’s spirits , and the past attentions of the lover producing a craving for their return ; and he was soon afterwards able to account for his not yet completely and indubitably seeing all this , by the prospect of another visitor , whose approach he could allow to be quite enough to support the spirits he was watching .
William Price	William had obtained a ten days ’ leave of absence , to be given to Northamptonshire , and was coming , the happiest of lieutenants , because the latest made , to shew his happiness and describe his uniform .
William Price	He came ; and he would have been delighted to shew his uniform there too , had not cruel custom prohibited its appearance except on duty .
William Price	This scheme was that she should accompany her brother back to Portsmouth , and spend a little time with her own family .
William Price	, she must have had a strong attack of them when she first understood what was intended , when her uncle first made her the offer of visiting the parents , and brothers , and sisters , from whom she had been divided almost half her life ; of returning for a couple of months to the scenes of her infancy , with William for the protector and companion of her journey , and the
William Price	continuing to see William to the last hour of his remaining on land . Had she ever given way to bursts of delight
William Price	Afterwards , when familiarised with the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened , she could speak more largely to William and Edmund of what she felt ; but still there were emotions of tenderness that could not be clothed in words .
William Price	William was almost as happy in the plan as his sister .
William Price	It would be the greatest pleasure to him to have her there to the last moment before he sailed , and perhaps find her there still when he came in from his first cruise .
William Price	And besides , he wanted her so very much to see the Thrush before she went out of harbour — the Thrush was certainly the finest sloop in the service — and there were several improvements in the dockyard , too , which he quite longed to shew her .
William Price	He did not scruple to add that her being at home for a while would be a great advantage to everybody .
William Price	“ I do not know how it is , ” said he ; “ but we seem to want some of your nice ways and orderliness at my father ’s .
William Price	You will set things going in a better way , I am sure .
William Price	You will tell my mother how it all ought to be , and you will be so useful to Susan , and you will teach Betsey , and make the boys love and mind you .
William Price	By the time Mrs. Price ’s answer arrived , there remained but a very few days more to be spent at Mansfield ; and for part of one of those days the young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of their journey , for when the mode of it came to be talked of , and Mrs. Norris found that all her anxiety to save her brother - in - law ’s money was vain , and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less expensive conveyance of Fanny , they were to travel post ; when she saw Sir Thomas actually give William notes for the purpose , she was struck with the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage , and suddenly seized with a strong inclination to go with them , to go and see her poor dear sister Price .
William Price	she could not help thinking her poor dear sister Price would feel it very unkind of her not to come by such an opportunity . William and Fanny were horror - struck at the idea .
William Price	it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving her the affectionate farewell of a brother . All this passed overnight , for the journey was to begin very early in the morning ; and when the small , diminished party met at breakfast , William and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage .
William Price	By the bye , Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out .
William Price	But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him , I should never have done .
William Price	It is you , only you , insensible Fanny , who can think of him with anything like indifference .
William Price	You must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power .
William Price	Was not he devoted to you at the ball ?
William Price	“ Do you mean , then , that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand ?
William Price	It was his own doing entirely , his own thought .
William Price	I am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head , but I was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes . ”
William Price	As to your brother ’s behaviour , certainly I was sensible of a particularity : I had been sensible of it some little time , perhaps two or three weeks ; but then I considered it as meaning nothing : I put it down as simply being his way , and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me .
William Price	I had not , Miss Crawford , been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn .
William Price	“ I do not defend him .
William Price	I leave him entirely to your mercy , and when he has got you at Everingham , I do not care how much you lecture him .
William Price	But this I will say , that his fault , the liking to make girls a little in love with him , is not half so dangerous to a wife ’s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself , which he has never been addicted to .
William Price	And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before ; that he loves you with all his heart , and will love you as nearly for ever as possible .
William Price	If any man ever loved a woman for ever , I think Henry will do as much for you . ”
William Price	“ I can not imagine Henry ever to have been happier , ” continued Mary presently , “ than when he had succeeded in getting your brother ’s commission . ”
William Price	How very , very kind of him .
William Price	“ I know he must have exerted himself very much , for I know the parties he had to move .
William Price	What a happy creature William must be !
William Price	I wish we could see him .
William Price	The recollection of what had been done for William was always the most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr. Crawford ; and she sat thinking deeply of it till Mary , who had been first watching her complacently , and then musing on something else , suddenly called her attention by saying : “ I should like to sit talking with you here all day , but we must not forget the ladies below , and so good - bye , my dear , my amiable , my excellent Fanny , for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast - parlour , I must take leave of you here .
William Price	“ I shall see your cousin in town soon : he talks of being there tolerably soon ; and Sir Thomas , I dare say , in the course of the spring ; and your eldest cousin , and the Rushworths , and Julia , I am sure of meeting again and again , and all but you .
William Price	Henry Crawford came and sat some time with them ; and her spirits not being previously in the strongest state , her heart was softened for a while towards him , because he really seemed to feel .
William Price	Quite unlike his usual self , he scarcely said anything .
William Price	He was evidently oppressed , and Fanny must grieve for him , though hoping she might never see him again till he were the husband of some other woman .
William Price	When it came to the moment of parting , he would take her hand , he would not be denied it ; he said nothing , however , or nothing that she heard ,
William Price	and when he had left the room , she was better pleased that such a token of friendship had passed .
William Price	I am sure William would never have used _ me _ so , under any circumstances .
William Price	XXXIX Could Sir Thomas have seen all his niece ’s feelings , when she wrote her first letter to her aunt , he would not have despaired ; for though a good night ’s rest , a pleasant morning , the hope of soon seeing William again , and the comparatively quiet state of the house , from Tom and Charles being gone to school , Sam on some project of his own , and her father on his usual lounges , enabled her to express herself cheerfully on the subject of home , there were still , to her own perfect consciousness , many drawbacks suppressed .
William Price	In the first place , William was gone .
William Price	Everything in that quarter failed her , except William ’s affection .
William Price	His last thought on leaving home was for her .
William Price	He stepped back again to the door to say , “ Take care of Fanny , mother .
William Price	I charge you , take care of Fanny . ”
William Price	William was gone : and the home he had left her in was , Fanny could not conceal it from herself , in almost every respect the very reverse of what she could have wished .
William Price	She was fond of her sons , especially of William , but Betsey was the
William Price	William was her pride ; Betsey her darling ; and
William Price	Fanny was very anxious to be useful , and not to appear above her home , or in any way disqualified or disinclined , by her foreign education , from contributing her help to its comforts , and therefore set about working for Sam immediately ; and by working early and late , with perseverance and great despatch , did so much that the boy was shipped off at last , with more than half his linen ready .
William Price	Sam , loud and overbearing as he was , she rather regretted when he went , for he was clever and intelligent , and glad to be employed in any errand in the town ; and though spurning the remonstrances of Susan , given as they were , though very reasonable in themselves , with ill - timed and powerless warmth , was beginning to be influenced by
William Price	she found that the best of the three younger ones was gone in him : Tom and Charles being at least as many years as they were his juniors distant from that age of feeling and reason , which might suggest the expediency of making friends , and of endeavouring to be less disagreeable .
William Price	Farther discussion was prevented by various bustles : first , the driver came to be paid ; then there was a squabble between Sam and Rebecca about the manner of carrying up his sister ’s trunk , which he would manage all his own way ; and lastly , in walked Mr. Price himself , his own loud voice preceding him , as with something of the oath kind he kicked away his son ’s portmanteau and his daughter ’s bandbox in the passage , and called out for a candle ; no candle was brought , however , and he walked into the room .
William Price	With a friendly shake of his son ’s hand , and an eager voice , he instantly began—“Ha !
William Price	welcome back , my boy .
William Price	Glad to see you .
William Price	Have you heard the news ?
William Price	Sharp is the word , you see !
William Price	By G — , you are just in time !
William Price	The doctor has been here inquiring for you
William Price	: he has got one of the boats , and is to be off for Spithead by six , so you had better go with him .
William Price	I have been to Turner ’s about your mess ; it is all in a way to be done .
William Price	I should not wonder if you had your orders to - morrow : but you can not sail with this wind ,
William Price	if you are to cruise to the westward ; and Captain Walsh thinks you will certainly have a cruise to the westward , with the Elephant .
William Price	By G — , I wish you may !
William Price	But old Scholey was saying , just now , that he thought you would be sent first to the Texel .
William Price	But by G — , you lost a fine sight by not being here in the morning to see the Thrush go out of harbour !
William Price	” “ Ha ! ” cried William , “ _ that ’s _ just where I should have put her myself .
William Price	But here is my sister , sir ; here is Fanny , ” turning and leading her forward ; “ it is so dark you do not see her .
William Price	Fanny shrunk back to her seat , with feelings sadly pained by his language and his smell of spirits ; and he talked on only to his son , and only of the Thrush , though William , warmly interested as he was in that subject , more than once tried to make his father think of Fanny , and her long absence and long journey . After sitting some time longer , a candle was obtained ; but as there was still no appearance of tea , nor , from Betsey ’s reports from the kitchen , much hope of any under a considerable period , William determined to go and change his dress , and make the necessary preparations for his removal on board directly , that he might have his tea in comfort afterwards .
William Price	As he left the room , two rosy - faced boys , ragged and dirty , about eight and nine years old ,
William Price	William was soon calling out from the landing - place of the second story for his mother and for Rebecca .
William Price	He was in distress for something that he had left there , and did not find again .
William Price	Mrs. Price , Rebecca , and Betsey all went up to defend themselves , all talking together , but Rebecca loudest , and the job was to be done as well as it could in a great hurry ; William trying in vain to send Betsey down again , or keep her from being troublesome where she was ; the whole of which , as almost every door in the house was open , could be plainly distinguished in the parlour , except when drowned at intervals by the superior noise of Sam , Tom , and Charles chasing each other up and down stairs , and tumbling about and hallooing . Fanny was almost stunned .
William Price	William ’s concerns must be dearest , they always had been , and he had every right .
William Price	That boy is fit for a boatswain .
William Price	Susan had an open , sensible countenance ; she was like William , and Fanny hoped to find her like him in disposition and goodwill towards herself .
William Price	In this more placid state of things William reentered , followed not far behind by his mother and Betsey .
William Price	He , complete in his lieutenant ’s uniform , looking and moving all the taller , firmer , and more graceful for it , and with the happiest smile over his face , walked up directly to Fanny , who , rising from her seat , looked at him for a moment in speechless admiration , and then threw her arms round his neck to sob out her various emotions of pain and pleasure .
William Price	Anxious not to appear unhappy , she soon recovered herself ; and wiping away her tears , was able to notice and admire all the striking parts of his dress ; listening with reviving spirits to his cheerful hopes of being on shore some part of every day before they sailed , and even of getting her to Spithead to see the sloop .
William Price	The next bustle brought in Mr. Campbell , the surgeon of the Thrush , a very well - behaved young man , who came to call for his friend , and for whom there was with some contrivance found a chair , and with some hasty washing of the young tea - maker ’s , a cup and saucer ; and after another quarter of an hour of earnest talk between the gentlemen , noise rising upon noise , and bustle upon bustle , men and boys at last all in motion together , the moment came for setting off ; everything was ready , William took leave , and all of them were gone ; for the three boys , in spite of their mother ’s entreaty , determined to see their brother and Mr. Campbell to the sally - port ; and Mr. Price walked off at the same time to carry back his neighbour ’s newspaper .
William Price	XXXI Henry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning , and at an earlier hour than common visiting warrants .
William Price	The two ladies were together in the breakfast - room , and , fortunately for him , Lady Bertram was on the very point of quitting it as he entered .
William Price	Henry , overjoyed to have her go , bowed and watched her off , and without losing another moment , turned instantly to Fanny , and , taking out some letters , said , with a most animated look , “ I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone : I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea . Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are , I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring .
William Price	Your brother is a lieutenant .
William Price	I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother ’s promotion .
William Price	Fanny could not speak , but he did not want her to speak .
William Price	She took the letters as he gave them .
William Price	The first was from the Admiral to inform his nephew , in a few words , of his having succeeded in the object he had undertaken , the promotion of young Price , and enclosing two more , one from the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend , whom the Admiral had set to work in the business , the other from that friend to himself , by which it appeared that his lordship had the very great happiness of attending to the recommendation of Sir Charles ; that Sir Charles was much delighted in having such an opportunity of proving his regard for Admiral Crawford , and that the circumstance of Mr. William Price ’s commission as Second Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made out was spreading general joy through a wide circle of great people .
William Price	While her hand was trembling under these letters , her eye running from one to the other , and her heart swelling with emotion , Crawford thus continued , with unfeigned eagerness , to express his interest in the event — “ I will not talk of my own happiness , ” said he , “ great as it is , for I think only of yours .
William Price	I have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world .
William Price	I have not lost a moment , however .
William Price	How impatient , how anxious , how wild I have been on the subject , I will not attempt to describe ; how severely mortified , how cruelly disappointed , in not having it finished while I was in London !
William Price	I was kept there from day to day in the hope of it , for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from Mansfield .
William Price	But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth I could desire , and exerted himself immediately , there were difficulties from the absence of one friend , and the engagements of another , which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of , and knowing in what good hands I left the cause , I came away on Monday , trusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by such very letters as these .
William Price	My uncle , who is the very best man in the world , has exerted himself , as I knew he would , after seeing your brother .
William Price	He was delighted with him .
William Price	I would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted , or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his praise .
William Price	I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of a friend , as this day _ does _ prove it .
William Price	I may say that even I could not require William Price to excite a greater interest , or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation , than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together .
William Price	” “ Has this been all _ your _ doing , then ? ” cried Fanny .
William Price	I beg your pardon , but I am bewildered .
William Price	Henry was most happy to make it more intelligible , by beginning at an earlier stage , and explaining very particularly what he had done .
William Price	His last journey to London had been undertaken with no other view than that of introducing her brother in Hill Street , and prevailing on the Admiral to exert whatever interest he might have for getting him on .
William Price	This had been his business .
William Price	He had communicated it to no creature : he had not breathed a syllable of it even to Mary ; while uncertain of the issue
William Price	, he could not have borne any participation of his feelings , but this had been his business ; and he spoke with such a glow of what his solicitude had been , and used such strong expressions , was so abounding in the _ deepest _ _ interest _ , in _ twofold _ _ motives _ , in _ views _ _ and _ _ wishes _ _ more _ _ than _ _ could _ _ be _ _ told _ , that Fanny could not have remained insensible of his drift , had she been able to attend ; but her heart was so full and her senses still so astonished , that she could listen but imperfectly even to what he told her of William , and saying only when he paused , “ How kind ! how very kind !
William Price	Oh , Mr. Crawford , we are infinitely obliged to you !
William Price	Dearest , dearest William ! ”
William Price	The opportunity was too fair , and his feelings too impatient .
William Price	He was after her immediately .
William Price	“ She must not go , she must allow him five minutes longer , ” and he took her hand and led her back to her seat , and was in the middle of his farther explanation , before she had suspected for what she was detained .
William Price	When she did understand it , however , and found herself expected to believe that she had created sensations which his heart had never known before , and that everything he had done for William was to be placed to the account of his excessive and unequalled attachment to her , she was exceedingly distressed , and for some moments unable to speak .
William Price	She considered it all as nonsense , as mere trifling and gallantry , which meant only to deceive for the hour ; she could not but feel that it was treating her improperly and unworthily , and in such a way as she had not deserved ; but it was like himself , and entirely of a piece with what she had seen before ; and she would not allow herself to shew half the displeasure she felt , because he had been conferring an obligation , which no want of delicacy on his part could make a trifle to her .
William Price	While her heart was still bounding with joy and gratitude on William ’s behalf , she could not be severely resentful of anything that injured only herself ; and after having twice drawn back her hand , and twice attempted in vain to turn away from him , she got up , and said only , with much agitation , “ Do n’t , Mr. Crawford , pray do n’t !
William Price	I beg you would not .
William Price	But he was still talking on , describing his affection , soliciting a return , and , finally , in words so plain as to bear but one meaning even to her , offering himself , hand , fortune , everything , to her acceptance .
William Price	It was so ; he had said it .
William Price	Her astonishment and confusion increased ; and though still not knowing how to suppose him serious , she could hardly stand .
William Price	He pressed for an answer .
William Price	Your kindness to William makes me more obliged to you than words can express ; but I do not want , I can not bear , I must not listen to such — No , no , do n’t think of me .
William Price	But you are _ not _ thinking of me .
William Price	She had burst away from him , and at that moment Sir Thomas was heard speaking to a servant in his way towards the room they were in .
William Price	She rushed out at an opposite door from the one her uncle was approaching , and was walking up and down the East room in the utmost confusion of contrary feeling , before Sir Thomas ’s politeness or apologies were over , or he had reached the beginning of the joyful intelligence which his visitor came to communicate .
William Price	But William was a lieutenant .
William Price	Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her so again : he must have seen how unwelcome it was to her ; and in that case , how gratefully she could esteem him for his friendship to William !
William Price	She would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the great staircase , till she had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford ’s having left the house ; but when convinced of his being gone , she was eager to go down and be with her uncle , and have all the happiness of his joy as well as her own , and all the benefit of his information or his conjectures as to what would now be William ’s destination .
William Price	Thomas was as joyful as she could desire , and very kind and communicative ; and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William as to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her , till she found , towards the close , that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and dine there that very day .
William Price	This was a most unwelcome hearing , for though he might think nothing of what had passed , it would be quite distressing to her to see him again so soon .
William Price	She tried to get the better of it ; tried very hard , as the dinner hour approached , to feel and appear as usual ; but it was quite impossible for her not to look most shy and uncomfortable when their visitor entered the room .
William Price	She could not have supposed it in the power of any concurrence of circumstances to give her so many painful sensations on the first day of hearing of William ’s promotion .
William Price	Mr. Crawford was not only in the room — he was soon close to her .
William Price	He had a note to deliver from his sister .
William Price	Fanny could not look at him , but there was no consciousness of past folly in his voice .
William Price	“ MY DEAR FANNY,—for so I may now always call you , to the infinite relief of a tongue that has been stumbling at _ Miss _ _ Price _ for at least the last six weeks — I can not let my brother go without sending you a few lines of general congratulation , and giving my most joyful consent and approval .
William Price	Go on , my dear Fanny , and without fear ; there can be no difficulties worth naming .
William Price	I chuse to suppose that the assurance of my consent will be something ; so you may smile upon him with your sweetest smiles this afternoon , and send him back to me even happier than he goes .
William Price	” These were not expressions to do Fanny any good ; for though she read in too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss Crawford ’s meaning , it was evident that she meant to compliment her on her brother ’s attachment , and even to _ appear _ to believe it serious .
William Price	She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her , and he spoke to her much too often ; and she was afraid there was a something in his voice and manner in addressing her very different from what they were when he talked to the others .
William Price	, she was ready to sink with shame , from the dread of Mr. Crawford ’s interpretation ; for though nothing could have tempted her to turn her eyes to the right hand , where he sat , she felt that _ his _ were immediately directed towards her .
William Price	She would hardly join even when William was the subject , for his commission came all from the right hand too , and there was pain in the connexion .
William Price	She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever , and began to be in despair of ever getting away ; but at last they were in the drawing - room , and she was able to think as she would , while her aunts finished the subject of William ’s appointment in their own style .
William Price	“ _ Now _ William would be able to keep himself , which would make a vast difference to his uncle , for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle ; and , indeed , it would make some difference in _ her _ presents too .
William Price	She was very glad that she had given William what she did at parting , very glad , indeed , that it had been in her power , without material inconvenience , just at that time to give him something rather considerable ; that is , for _ her _ , with _ her _ limited means , for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin .
William Price	She knew he must be at some expense , that he would have many things to buy , though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap ; but she was very glad she had contributed her mite towards it .
William Price	” “ I am glad you gave him something considerable , ” said Lady Bertram , with most unsuspicious calmness , “ for _ I _ gave him only £ 10 . ”
William Price	“ Upon my word , he must have gone off with his pockets well lined , and at no expense for his journey to London either ! ”
William Price	Fanny , William must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies ; and I shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having .
William Price	I wish he may go to the East Indies , that I may have my shawl .
William Price	Fanny , meanwhile , speaking only when she could not help it , was very earnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss Crawford were at .
William Price	There was everything in the world _ against _ their being serious but his words and manner .
William Price	How could _ she _ have excited serious attachment in a man who had seen so many , and been admired by so many , and flirted with so many , infinitely her superiors ; who seemed so little open to serious impressions , even where pains had been taken to please him ; who thought so slightly , so carelessly , so unfeelingly on all such points ; who was everything to everybody , and seemed to find no one essential to him ? And farther , how could it be supposed that his sister , with all her high and worldly notions of matrimony , would be forwarding anything of a serious nature in such a quarter ?
William Price	She had quite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas and Mr. Crawford joined them .
William Price	The difficulty was in maintaining the conviction quite so absolutely after Mr. Crawford was in the room
William Price	But she still tried to believe it no more than what he might often have expressed towards her cousins and fifty other women .
William Price	She thought he was wishing to speak to her unheard by the rest .
William Price	She fancied he was trying for it the whole evening at intervals , whenever Sir Thomas was out of the room , or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris , and she carefully refused him every opportunity .
William Price	At last — it seemed an at last to Fanny ’s nervousness , though not remarkably late — he began to talk of going away ; but the comfort of the sound was impaired by his turning to her the next moment , and saying , “ Have you nothing to send to Mary ?
William Price	Quite unpractised in such sort of note - writing , had there been time for scruples and fears as to style she would have felt them in abundance : but something must be instantly written ; and with only one decided feeling , that of wishing not to appear to think anything really intended , she wrote thus , in great trembling both of spirits and hand — “ I am very much obliged to you , my dear Miss Crawford , for your kind congratulations , as far as they relate to my dearest William .
William Price	I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his manners ; if he understood me as well , he would , I dare say , behave differently .
William Price	The conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright , for she found that Mr. Crawford , under pretence of receiving the note , was coming towards her .
William Price	“ You can not think I mean to hurry you , ” said he , in an undervoice , perceiving the amazing trepidation with which she made up the note , “ you can not think I have any such object .
William Price	Do not hurry yourself , I entreat . ”
William Price	I thank you ; I have quite done , just done ; it will be ready in a moment ; I am very much obliged to you ; if you will be so good as to give _ that _ to Miss Crawford
William Price	The note was held out , and must be taken ; and as she instantly and with averted eyes walked towards the fireplace , where sat the others , he had nothing to do but to go in good earnest . Fanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation , both of pain and pleasure ; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to die with the day ; for every day would restore the knowledge of William ’s advancement , whereas the pain , she hoped , would return no more .
William Price	She had no doubt that her note must appear excessively ill - written , that the language would disgrace a child , for her distress had allowed no arrangement ; but at least it would assure them both of her being neither imposed on nor gratified by Mr. Crawford ’s attentions .
Edmund Bertram	She must have a sensation of being honoured , and whether thinking of herself or her brother , she must have a strong feeling of gratitude .
Edmund Bertram	XLI A week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town , and Fanny had heard nothing of him .
Edmund Bertram	were three different conclusions to be drawn from his silence , between which her mind was in fluctuation ;
Edmund Bertram	Either his going had been again delayed , or he had yet procured no opportunity of seeing Miss Crawford alone , or he was too happy for letter - writing !
Edmund Bertram	Fanny was doubly silenced here ; though when the moment was passed , could regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged comprehension of one half of his meaning , and encouraged him to say something more of his sister and Edmund .
Edmund Bertram	By the time he had given all this information , it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to ; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye , and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London ; that she had sent her best and kindest love , but had had no time for writing ; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour , having spent scarcely twenty - four hours in London , after his return from Norfolk , before he set off again ; that her cousin Edmund was in town , had been in town , he understood , a few days ; that he had not seen him himself , but that he was well , had left them all well at Mansfield , and was to dine , as yesterday , with the Frasers .
Edmund Bertram	, removed first to the Park , and afterwards to a small house of Sir Thomas ’s in the village , and consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him ; and for her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy . The living was hereafter for Edmund ; and , had his uncle died a few years sooner , it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders .
Edmund Bertram	But Tom ’s extravagance had , previous to that event , been so great as to render a different disposal of the next presentation necessary , and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder .
Edmund Bertram	There was another family living actually held for Edmund ; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir Thomas ’s conscience , he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice , and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction , in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been able to say or do .
Edmund Bertram	You have robbed Edmund for ten , twenty , thirty years , perhaps for life , of more than half the income which ought to be his .
Edmund Bertram	It may hereafter be in my power , or in yours ( I hope it will ) , to procure him better preferment ; but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us , and that nothing can , in fact , be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts . ”
Edmund Bertram	But “ no , he was a short - necked , apoplectic sort of fellow , and , plied well with good things , would soon pop off .
Edmund Bertram	He had a wife about fifteen years his junior , but no children ; and they entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being
Edmund Bertram	As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress .
Edmund Bertram	He could not but wonder at her refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt ; but , as she took early care to make him , as well as Lady Bertram , understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family , he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which , at the same time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them , would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself . Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal ; and her spontaneous , untaught felicity on the discovery , conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her .
Edmund Bertram	He could not think Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them , or rather , to perform what should have been her own ; but , in Mrs. Norris ’s watchful attention , and in Edmund ’s judgment , he had sufficient confidence to make him go without fears for their conduct .
Edmund Bertram	XXXV Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse whether her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned between them or not ; and that if she did not lead the way , it should never be touched on by him ; but after a day or two of mutual reserve , he was induced by his father to change his mind , and try what his influence might do for his friend .
Edmund Bertram	A day , and a very early day , was actually fixed for the Crawfords ’ departure ; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one more effort for the young man before he left Mansfield , that all his professions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to sustain them as possible .
Edmund Bertram	Sir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of Mr. Crawford ’s character in that point .
Edmund Bertram	He wished him to be a model of constancy ; and fancied the best means of effecting it would be by not trying him too long .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business ; he wanted to know Fanny ’s feelings .
Edmund Bertram	“ I will speak to her , sir : I will take the first opportunity of speaking to her alone , ” was the result of such thoughts as these ; and
Edmund Bertram	upon Sir Thomas ’s information of her being at that very time walking alone in the shrubbery , he instantly joined her . “ I am come to walk with you , Fanny , ” said he .
Edmund Bertram	Drawing her arm within his .
Edmund Bertram	“ But , Fanny , ” he presently added , “ in order to have a comfortable walk , something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together .
Edmund Bertram	You must talk to me .
Edmund Bertram	I know you have something on your mind .
Edmund Bertram	I know what you are thinking of .
Edmund Bertram	You can not suppose me uninformed .
Edmund Bertram	Am I to hear of it from everybody but Fanny herself ?
Edmund Bertram	Fanny , at once agitated and dejected , replied , “ If you hear of it from everybody , cousin , there can be nothing for me to tell . ” “ Not of facts , perhaps ; but of feelings , Fanny . No one but you can tell me them .
Edmund Bertram	I do not mean to press you , however .
Edmund Bertram	If it is not what you wish yourself , I have done .
Edmund Bertram	I had thought it might be a relief . ”
Edmund Bertram	I have no idea of it .
Edmund Bertram	I dare say that , on a comparison of our opinions , they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be : to the point — I consider Crawford ’s proposals as most advantageous and desirable , if you could return his affection .
Edmund Bertram	I consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it ; but that , as you can not , you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him .
Edmund Bertram	Were I even careless in general on such matters , how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake ? ” “ My uncle thought me wrong , and I knew he had been talking to you . ” “ As far as you have gone , Fanny , I think you perfectly right .
Edmund Bertram	I may be sorry , I may be surprised — though hardly _ that _ , for you had not had time to attach yourself — but I think you perfectly right .
Edmund Bertram	You have proved yourself upright and disinterested , prove yourself grateful and tender - hearted ; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always believed you born for . ”
Edmund Bertram	And she spoke with a warmth which quite astonished Edmund , and which she blushed at the recollection of herself , when she saw his look , and heard him reply , “ Never !
Edmund Bertram	“ I must hope better things .
Edmund Bertram	I am aware , more aware than Crawford can be , that the man who means to make you love him ( you having due notice of his intentions ) must have very uphill work , for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array ; and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate , which so many years ’ growth have confirmed , and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation .
Edmund Bertram	I know that the apprehension of being forced to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you against him .
Edmund Bertram	I wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for .
Edmund Bertram	I wish he had known you as well as I do , Fanny .
Edmund Bertram	Between us , I think we should have won you .
Edmund Bertram	My theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not
Edmund Bertram	He should have worked upon my plans .
Edmund Bertram	I must hope , however , that time , proving him ( as I firmly believe it will ) to deserve you by his steady affection , will give him his reward .
Edmund Bertram	I can not suppose that you have not the _ wish _ to love him — the natural wish of gratitude .
Edmund Bertram	You forget yourself : there is a decided difference in your tempers , I allow .
Edmund Bertram	I am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance .
Edmund Bertram	I am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike : I mean unlike in the flow of the spirits , in the manners , in the inclination for much or little company , in the propensity to talk or to be silent , to be grave or to be gay .
Edmund Bertram	Some opposition here is , I am thoroughly convinced , friendly to matrimonial happiness .
Edmund Bertram	” Full well could Fanny guess where his thoughts were now :
Edmund Bertram	He had been speaking of her cheerfully from the hour of his coming home .
Edmund Bertram	His avoiding her was quite at an end .
Edmund Bertram	He had dined at the Parsonage only the preceding day .
Edmund Bertram	After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes , Fanny , feeling it due to herself , returned to Mr. Crawford , and said , “ It is not merely in _ temper _ that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself ; though , in _ that _ respect , I think the difference between us too great , infinitely too great : his spirits often oppress me ; but there is something in him which I object to still more .
Edmund Bertram	I must say , cousin , that I can not approve his character .
Edmund Bertram	“ My dear Fanny , ” replied Edmund , scarcely hearing her to the end , “ let us not , any of us , be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly .
Edmund Bertram	” “ I am persuaded that he does not think , as he ought , on serious subjects . ” “ Say , rather , that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects , which I believe to be a good deal the case .
Edmund Bertram	Crawford ’s _ feelings _ , I am ready to acknowledge , have hitherto been too much his guides .
Edmund Bertram	He will make you happy , Fanny ; I know he will make you happy ; but you will make him everything .
Edmund Bertram	Well , though I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings , you will be persuaded into them , I trust .
Edmund Bertram	I confess myself sincerely anxious that you may .
Edmund Bertram	I have no common interest in Crawford ’s well - doing .
Edmund Bertram	Next to your happiness , Fanny , his has the first claim on me .
Edmund Bertram	You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund first began again — “ I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday , particularly pleased , because I had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light .
Edmund Bertram	I knew she was very fond of you ; but yet I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved , and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune .
Edmund Bertram	I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims , which she has been too much used to hear .
Edmund Bertram	She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself .
Edmund Bertram	I should not have mentioned the subject , though very anxious to know her sentiments ; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart , and sweet peculiarity of manner , that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself .
Edmund Bertram	Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity . ” “ Was Mrs. Grant in the room , then ? ” “ Yes , when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in .
Edmund Bertram	“ I knew she would be very angry with me . ” “ My dearest Fanny , ” cried Edmund , pressing her arm closer to him , “ do not let the idea of her anger distress you .
Edmund Bertram	I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise ; I
Edmund Bertram	And I observed that she always spoke of you as ‘ Fanny , ’ which she was never used to do ; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality .
Edmund Bertram	I said what I could for you ; but in good truth , as they stated the case — you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct ; nothing else will satisfy them .
Edmund Bertram	I have done .
Edmund Bertram	Do not turn away from me . ”
Edmund Bertram	And , and — we think very differently of the nature of women , if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply . ” “ My dear , dear Fanny , now I have the truth .
Edmund Bertram	I know this to be the truth ; and most worthy of you are such feelings .
Edmund Bertram	I had attributed them to you before .
Edmund Bertram	I thought I could understand you .
Edmund Bertram	You have now given exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant , and they were both better satisfied , though your warm - hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry .
Edmund Bertram	I told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least ; and that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford ’s addresses was against him .
Edmund Bertram	She feared she had been doing wrong : saying too much , overacting the caution which she had been fancying necessary ; in guarding against one evil , laying herself open to another ; and to have Miss Crawford ’s liveliness repeated to her at such a moment , and on such a subject , was a bitter aggravation . Edmund saw weariness and distress in her face , and immediately resolved to forbear all farther discussion ; and not even to mention the name of Crawford again , except as it might be connected with what _ must _ be agreeable to her .
Edmund Bertram	On this principle , he soon afterwards observed—“They
Edmund Bertram	They really go on Monday ; and I was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day !
Edmund Bertram	I had almost promised it .
Edmund Bertram	Those five or six days more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life . ” “ You were near staying there ? ” “ Very .
Edmund Bertram	I was most kindly pressed , and had nearly consented .
Edmund Bertram	Had I received any letter from Mansfield , to tell me how you were all going on , I believe I should certainly have staid ; but I knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight , and felt that I had been away long enough . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You spent your time pleasantly there ?
Edmund Bertram	“ Yes ; that is , it was the fault of my own mind if I did not .
Edmund Bertram	I doubt their finding me so .
Edmund Bertram	I took uneasiness with me , and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ The Miss Owens — you liked them , did not you ? ”
Edmund Bertram	But I am spoilt , Fanny , for common female society .
Edmund Bertram	You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice . ” Still , however , Fanny was oppressed and wearied ; he saw it in her looks , it could not be talked away ; and attempting it no more , he led her directly , with the kind authority of a privileged guardian , into the house .
Edmund Bertram	Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well , though affecting to despise it ; and was too much engaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others , or draw any of those conclusions , or feel any of that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for . Thus much was settled before Edmund , who had been out all the morning , knew anything of the matter ; but when he entered the drawing - room before dinner , the buzz of discussion was high between Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates ; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him the agreeable news .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny ’s eyes followed Edmund , and her heart beat for him as she heard this speech , and saw his look , and felt what his sensations must be .
Edmund Bertram	“ Lovers ’ Vows ! ” in a tone of the greatest amazement , was his only reply to Mr. Rushworth , and he turned towards his brother and sisters as if hardly doubting a contradiction .
Edmund Bertram	“ But what do you do for women ? ” said Edmund gravely , and looking at Maria .
Edmund Bertram	Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered , “ I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done , and ” ( with a bolder eye ) “ Miss Crawford is to be Amelia . ” “ I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up , with _ us _ , ” replied Edmund , turning away to the fire , where sat his mother , aunt , and Fanny , and seating himself with a look of great vexation .
Edmund Bertram	Mr. Rushworth followed him to say , “ I come in three times , and have two - and - forty speeches .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund could not answer him .
Edmund Bertram	“ I am perfectly acquainted with the play , I assure you ; and with a very few omissions , and so forth , which will be made , of course , I can see nothing objectionable in it ; and _ I _ am not the _ only _ young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I am sorry for it , ” was his answer ; “ but in this matter it is _ you _ who are to lead .
Edmund Bertram	In all points of decorum _ your _ conduct must be law to the rest of the party . ” This picture of her consequence had some effect , for no one loved better to lead than Maria ; and with far more good - humour she answered , “ I am much obliged to you , Edmund ; you mean very well , I am sure : but I still think you see things too strongly ; and I really can not undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind .
Edmund Bertram	“ I am convinced , madam , ” said Edmund , preventing Fanny , “ that Sir Thomas would not like it . ” “ There , my dear , do you hear what Edmund says ? ” “ If I were to decline the part , ” said Maria , with renewed zeal , “ Julia would certainly take it . ” “ What ! ” cried Edmund , “ if she knew your reasons ! ”
Edmund Bertram	No ; you must excuse me ; I can not retract my consent ; it is too far settled , everybody would be so disappointed , Tom would be quite angry ; and if we are so very nice , we shall never act anything . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ If every play is to be objected to , you will act nothing , and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away , and I am sure _ that _ would be a discredit to us all .
Edmund Bertram	We must not be over - precise , Edmund .
Edmund Bertram	I only wish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began , for there was the loss of half a day ’s work about those side - doors .
Edmund Bertram	Nobody was at the trouble of an answer ; the others soon returned ; and Edmund found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his only satisfaction .
Edmund Bertram	Mrs. Norris related again her triumph over Dick Jackson , but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked of , for Edmund ’s disapprobation was felt even by his brother , though he would not have owned it .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund
Edmund Bertram	She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram , but Edmund said nothing .
Edmund Bertram	His being only a bystander was not disclaimed .
Edmund Bertram	Such a forward young lady may well frighten the men . ” “ I should be but too happy in taking the part , if it were possible , ” cried Tom ; “ but , unluckily , the Butler and Anhalt are in together .
Edmund Bertram	I will not entirely give it up , however ; I will try what can be done — I will look it over again . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ _ I _ should have no objection , ” she replied ; “ for though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported , that is , if everything went well , I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience ; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _ that _ _ table _ ” ( looking round ) , “ it certainly will not be taken . ” Edmund said no more .
Edmund Bertram	“ If _ any _ part could tempt _ you _ to act , I suppose it would be Anhalt , ” observed the lady archly , after a short pause ; “ for he is a clergyman , you know .
Edmund Bertram	“ _ That _ circumstance would by no means tempt me , ” he replied , “ for I should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny was up in a moment , expecting some errand ; for the habit of employing her in that way was not yet overcome , in spite of all that Edmund could do .
Edmund Bertram	” “ You must excuse me , indeed you must excuse me , ” cried Fanny , growing more and more red from excessive agitation , and looking distressfully at Edmund , who was kindly observing her ; but unwilling to exasperate his brother by interference , gave her only an encouraging smile .
Edmund Bertram	“ Do not urge her , madam , ” said Edmund .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund was too angry to speak ; but Miss Crawford , looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris , and then at Fanny , whose tears were beginning to shew themselves , immediately said , with some keenness , “ I do not like my situation : this _ place _ is too hot for me , ” and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table , close to Fanny , saying to her , in a kind , low whisper , as she placed herself , “ Never mind , my dear Miss Price , this is a cross evening : everybody is cross and teasing , but do not let us mind them ” ;
Edmund Bertram	By a look at her brother she prevented any farther entreaty from the theatrical board , and the really good feelings by which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to all the little she had lost in Edmund ’s favour .
Edmund Bertram	and when , from taking notice of her work , and wishing _ she _ could work as well , and begging for the pattern , and supposing Fanny was now preparing for her _ appearance _ , as of course she would come out when her cousin was married , Miss Crawford proceeded to inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea , and said that she had quite a curiosity to see him , and imagined him a very fine young man , and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea again — she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery , or help listening , and answering with more animation than she had intended .
Edmund Bertram	While he spoke , Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in full expectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as this : so contrary to all their first protestations ; but Edmund said nothing .
Edmund Bertram	Yes , Mr. Charles Maddox dined at my sister ’s one day , did not he , Henry ?
Edmund Bertram	Let _ him _ be applied to , if you please , for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger . ”
Edmund Bertram	Tom repeated his resolution of going to him early on the morrow ; and though Julia , who had scarcely opened her lips before , observed , in a sarcastic manner , and with a glance first at Maria and then at Edmund , that “ the Mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly , ” Edmund still held his peace , and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity .
Edmund Bertram	“ If you put such a question to her , ” cried Edmund , preventing his cousin ’s speaking , “ Fanny will immediately say No ; but I am sure ,
Edmund Bertram	So I will , Edmund .
Edmund Bertram	“ Well , ” said Sir Thomas , as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise . “ Edmund wants her to go .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund found himself obliged to speak and fill up the blanks in his mother ’s story .
Edmund Bertram	He told the whole ; and she had only to add , “ So strange ! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her . ” “ But is it not very natural , ” observed Edmund , “ that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? ” “ Nothing can be more natural , ” said Sir Thomas , after a short deliberation ; “ nor , were there no sister in the case , could anything , in my opinion , be more natural .
Edmund Bertram	“ Very well , then , Fanny may go , Edmund . ”
Edmund Bertram	Edmund knocked at her door in his way to his own .
Edmund Bertram	“ Thank you , I am _ so _ glad , ” was Fanny ’s instinctive reply ; though when she had turned from him and shut the door , she could not help feeling , “ And yet why should I be glad ?
Edmund Bertram	And as to coming away at night , you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses .
Edmund Bertram	Leave him to settle _ that _ .
Edmund Bertram	But Edmund goes ; true , it is upon Edmund ’s account .
Edmund Bertram	I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night .
Edmund Bertram	“ Now I must look at you , Fanny , ” said Edmund , with the kind smile of an affectionate brother , “ and tell you how I like you ; and as well as I can judge by this light , you look very nicely indeed .
Edmund Bertram	I hope you do not think me too fine . ” “ A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white .
Edmund Bertram	“ Heyday ! ” said Edmund , “ here ’s company , here ’s a carriage !
Edmund Bertram	A very cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund ; and with the exception of Fanny , the pleasure was general ; and even to _ her _ there might be some advantage in his presence , since every addition to the party must rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered to sit silent and unattended to .
Edmund Bertram	She could not compliment the newly arrived gentleman , however , with any appearance of interest , in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield , and sending for his hunters from Norfolk , which , suggested by Dr. Grant , advised by Edmund , and warmly urged by the two sisters , was soon in possession of his mind , and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her
Edmund Bertram	She could not compliment the newly arrived gentleman , however , with any appearance of interest , in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield , and sending for his hunters from Norfolk , which , suggested by Dr. Grant , advised by Edmund , and warmly urged by the two sisters , was soon in possession of his mind , and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her
Edmund Bertram	She could not wish him to stay , and would much rather not have him speak to her .
Edmund Bertram	Her two absent cousins , especially Maria , were much in her thoughts on seeing him ; but no embarrassing remembrance affected _ his _ spirits .
Edmund Bertram	Here he was again on the same ground where all had passed before , and apparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams , as if he had never known Mansfield in any other state . She heard them spoken of by him only in a general way , till they were all re - assembled in the drawing - room , when Edmund , being engaged apart in some matter of business with Dr. Grant , which seemed entirely to engross them , and Mrs. Grant occupied at the tea - table , he began talking of them with more particularity to his other sister .

Edmund Bertram	With a significant smile , which made Fanny quite hate him , he said , “ So !
Edmund Bertram	Rushworth and his fair bride are at Brighton , I understand ; happy man ! ”
Edmund Bertram	Your kindness and patience can never be forgotten , your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part — in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied — to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own !
Edmund Bertram	_ He _ might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness , but I may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ We were unlucky , Miss Price , ” he continued , in a lower tone , to avoid the possibility of being heard by Edmund , and not at all aware of her feelings , “ we certainly were very unlucky .
Edmund Bertram	Not that we would have endangered his safety by any tremendous weather — but only by a steady contrary wind , or a calm .
Edmund Bertram	I think , Miss Price , we would have indulged ourselves with a week ’s calm in the Atlantic at that season . ” He seemed determined to be answered ; and Fanny , averting her face , said , with a firmer tone than usual , “ As far as _ I _ am concerned , sir , I would not have delayed his return for a day .
Edmund Bertram	My uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive , that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough .
Edmund Bertram	Miss Crawford , who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund , now observed , “ Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss . ”
Edmund Bertram	His sister tried to laugh off her feelings by saying , “ Nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves .
Edmund Bertram	You would look rather blank , Henry , if your _ menus _ _ plaisirs _ were to be limited to seven hundred a year . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Perhaps I might ; but all _ that _ you know is entirely comparative . Birthright and habit must settle the business .
Edmund Bertram	Miss Price , will not you join me in encouraging your cousin ?
Edmund Bertram	Will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time — as I shall do — not to lose a word ; or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful ?
Edmund Bertram	Will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time — as I shall do — not to lose a word ; or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful ?
Edmund Bertram	” “ I shall keep clear of you , Crawford , as long as I can , ” said Edmund ; “ for you would be more likely to disconcert me , and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Will he not feel this ? ” thought Fanny .
Edmund Bertram	“ No , he can feel nothing as he ought . ”
Edmund Bertram	The assurance of Edmund ’s being so soon to take orders , coming upon her like a blow that had been suspended , and still hoped uncertain and at a distance , was felt with resentment and mortification .
Edmund Bertram	She was very angry with him .
Edmund Bertram	She _ had _ begun to think of him ; she felt that she had , with great regard , with almost decided intentions ; but she would now meet him with his own cool feelings .
Edmund Bertram	It was plain that he could have no serious views , no true attachment , by fixing himself in a situation which he must know she would never stoop to .
Edmund Bertram	She would learn to match him in his indifference .
Edmund Bertram	She would henceforth admit his attentions without any idea beyond immediate amusement .
Edmund Bertram	If _ he _ could so command his affections , _ hers _ should do her no harm .
Edmund Bertram	“ Now , Edmund , do not be disagreeable , ” said Julia .
Edmund Bertram	“ Nobody loves a play better than you do , or can have gone much farther to see one . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ True , to see real acting , good hardened real acting ; but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade : a set of gentlemen and ladies , who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through . ” After a short pause , however , the subject still continued , and was discussed with unabated eagerness , every one ’s inclination increasing by the discussion , and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest ; and though nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy , and his sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy , and that nothing in the world could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all , the resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as to make Edmund quite uncomfortable .
Edmund Bertram	He was determined to prevent it , if possible , though his mother , who equally heard the conversation which passed at table , did not evince the least disapprobation .
Edmund Bertram	The same evening afforded him an opportunity of trying his strength .
Edmund Bertram	Tom , returning from them into the drawing - room , where Edmund was standing thoughtfully by the fire , while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at a little distance , and Fanny close beside her arranging her work , thus began as he entered—“Such a horribly vile billiard - table as ours is not to be met with , I believe , above ground .
Edmund Bertram	I can stand it no longer , and I think , I may say , that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again ; but one good thing I have just ascertained : it is the very room for a theatre , precisely the shape and length for it ; and the doors at the farther end , communicating with each other , as they may be made to do in five minutes , by merely moving the bookcase in my father ’s room , is the very thing we could have desired , if we had sat down to wish for it ; and my father ’s room will be an excellent greenroom .
Edmund Bertram	” “ You are not serious , Tom , in meaning to act ? ” said Edmund , in a low voice , as his brother approached the fire .
Edmund Bertram	never more so , I assure you .
Edmund Bertram	“ I think it would be very wrong .
Edmund Bertram	, I must think it would be highly injudicious , and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind .
Edmund Bertram	It would shew great want of feeling on my father ’s account , absent as he is , and in some degree of constant danger ; and it would be imprudent , I think , with regard to Maria , whose situation is a very delicate one , considering everything , extremely delicate .
Edmund Bertram	“ You take up a thing so seriously ! as if we were going to act three times a week till my father ’s return , and invite all the country .
Edmund Bertram	And as to my father ’s being absent , it is so far from an objection , that I consider it rather as a motive ; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother ; and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety , and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks , I shall think our time very well spent , and so , I am sure , will he .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund smiled and shook his head .
Edmund Bertram	Well , Edmund , ” he continued , returning to the former subject , posture , and voice , as soon as Lady Bertram began to nod again , “ but _ this _ I _ will _ maintain , that we shall be doing no harm . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I can not agree with you ; I am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it . ”
Edmund Bertram	Nobody is fonder of the exercise of talent in young people , or promotes it more , than my father , and for anything of the acting , spouting , reciting kind , I think he has always a decided taste .
Edmund Bertram	I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys .
Edmund Bertram	And I am sure , _ my _ _ name _ _ was _ _ Norval _ , every evening of my life through one Christmas holidays . ” “ It was a very different thing .
Edmund Bertram	My father wished us , as schoolboys , to speak well , but he would never wish his grown - up daughters to be acting plays .
Edmund Bertram	“ I know my father as well as you do ; and I ’ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him .
Edmund Bertram	Manage your own concerns , Edmund , and I ’ll take care of the rest of the family .
Edmund Bertram	“ If you are resolved on acting , ” replied the persevering Edmund , “ I must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way ; and I think a theatre ought not to be attempted .
Edmund Bertram	It would be taking liberties with my father ’s house in his absence which could not be justified .
Edmund Bertram	I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have ; and as to such alterations as I was suggesting just now , such as moving a bookcase , or unlocking a door , or even as using the billiard - room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it , you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room , and less in the breakfast - room , than we did before he went away , or to my sister ’s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other .
Edmund Bertram	Do n’t imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge but yourself .
Edmund Bertram	Do n’t act yourself , if you do not like it , but do n’t expect to govern everybody else . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ No , as to acting myself , ” said Edmund , “ _ that _ I absolutely protest against . ”
Edmund Bertram	Tom walked out of the room as he said it , and Edmund was left to sit down and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny , who had heard it all , and borne Edmund company in every feeling throughout the whole
Edmund Bertram	Your brother ’s taste and your sisters ’ seem very different . ”
Edmund Bertram	Edmund had little to hope , but he was still urging the subject when Henry Crawford entered the room , fresh from the Parsonage , calling out , “ No want of hands in our theatre , Miss Bertram .
Edmund Bertram	Maria gave Edmund a glance , which meant , “ What say you now ?
Edmund Bertram	And Edmund , silenced , was obliged to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carry fascination to the mind of genius ; and with the ingenuity of love , to dwell more on the obliging , accommodating purport of the message than on anything else
Edmund Bertram	Opposition was vain ; and as to Mrs. Norris , he was mistaken in supposing she would wish to make any .
Edmund Bertram	She started no difficulties that were not talked down in five minutes by her eldest nephew and niece , who were all - powerful with her ; and
Edmund Bertram	after tea , as Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight scene , while the Miss Bertrams , Mr. Rushworth , and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte , she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group , and saying , “ How happy Mr. Rushworth looks !
Edmund Bertram	Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too , but had nothing to say .
Edmund Bertram	“ There is no sacrifice in the case , ” replied Edmund , with a serious smile , and glancing at the pianoforte again ; “ it is entirely her own doing . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected , you think ? ” said Edmund .
Edmund Bertram	“ I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny , ” said Edmund affectionately , “ must be beyond the reach of any sermons . ”
Edmund Bertram	Fanny turned farther into the window ; and Miss Crawford had only time to say , in a pleasant manner , “ I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it ” ; when , being earnestly invited by the Miss Bertrams to join in a glee , she tripped off to the instrument , leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many virtues , from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread .
Edmund Bertram	“ There goes good - humour , I am sure , ” said he presently .
Edmund Bertram	What a pity , ” he added , after an instant ’s reflection , “ that she should have been in such hands ! ”
Edmund Bertram	Fanny agreed to it , and had the pleasure of seeing him continue at the window with her , in spite of the expected glee ; and of having his eyes soon turned , like hers , towards the scene without , where all that was solemn , and soothing , and lovely , appeared in the brilliancy of an unclouded night , and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny ’s best consolation was in being assured that Edmund had wished for her very much , and that he should certainly have come back for her , had she not been tired already ; but this was not quite sufficient to do away with the pain of having been left a whole hour , when he had talked of only a few minutes , nor to banish the sort of curiosity she felt to know what they had been conversing about all that time ; and the result of the whole was to her disappointment and depression , as they prepared by general agreement to return to the house .
Edmund Bertram	She was returned to Mansfield Park , she was useful , she was beloved ; she was safe from Mr. Crawford ; and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits , of his perfect approbation and increased regard ; and happy as all this must make her , she would still have been happy without any of it , for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford .
Edmund Bertram	It is true that Edmund was very far from happy himself .
Edmund Bertram	He was suffering from disappointment and regret , grieving over what was , and wishing for what could never be .
Edmund Bertram	He became what he ought to be : useful to his father , steady and quiet , and not living merely for himself .
Edmund Bertram	and quite as soon as Sir Thomas could place dependence on such sources of good , Edmund was contributing to his father ’s ease by improvement in the only point in which he had given him pain before — improvement in his spirits .
Edmund Bertram	Would he have persevered , and uprightly , Fanny must have been his reward , and a reward very voluntarily bestowed , within a reasonable period from Edmund ’s marrying Mary .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund had greatly the advantage of her in this respect .
Edmund Bertram	He had not to wait and wish with vacant affections for an object worthy to succeed her in them .
Edmund Bertram	Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford , and observing to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such another woman , before it began to strike him whether a very different kind of woman might not do just as well , or a great deal better : whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear , as important to him in all her smiles and all her ways , as Mary Crawford had ever been ; and whether it might not be a possible , a hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love . I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion , that every one may be at liberty to fix their own , aware that the cure of unconquerable passions , and the transfer of unchanging attachments , must vary much as to time in different people .
Edmund Bertram	I only entreat everybody to believe that exactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so , and not a week earlier , Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford , and became as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire .
Edmund Bertram	Sick of ambitious and mercenary connexions , prizing more and more the sterling good of principle and temper , and chiefly anxious to bind by the strongest securities all that remained to him of domestic felicity , he had pondered with genuine satisfaction on the more than possibility of the two young friends finding their natural consolation in each other for all that had occurred of disappointment to either ; and the joyful consent which met Edmund ’s application , the high sense of having realised a great acquisition in the promise of Fanny for a daughter , formed just such a contrast with his early opinion on the subject when the poor little girl ’s coming had been first agitated , as time is for ever producing between the plans and decisions of mortals , for their own instruction , and their neighbours ’ entertainment .
Edmund Bertram	In _ her _ usefulness , in Fanny ’s excellence , in William ’s continued good conduct and rising fame , and in the general well - doing and success of the other members of the family , all assisting to advance each other , and doing credit to his countenance and aid , Sir Thomas saw repeated , and for ever repeated , reason to rejoice in what he had done for them all , and acknowledge the advantages of early hardship and discipline , and the consciousness of being born to struggle and endure .
Edmund Bertram	“ It sounds like it , ” said Edmund ; “ but which way did you turn after passing Sewell ’s farm ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions ; though were I to answer all that you could put in the course of an hour , you would never be able to prove that it was _ not _ Thornton Lacey — for such it certainly was . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Well , ” continued Edmund , “ and how did you like what you saw ? ” “ Very much indeed .
Edmund Bertram	The farmyard must be moved , I grant you ; but I am not aware of anything else .
Edmund Bertram	“ And I have two or three ideas also , ” said Edmund , “ and one of them is , that very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in practice .
Edmund Bertram	I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty .
Edmund Bertram	Miss Crawford listened , and Edmund agreed to this .
Edmund Bertram	“ And Fanny had much rather it were William ’s , ” said Edmund , smiling at her .
Edmund Bertram	As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford ’s behaviour ; but when the whist - table broke up at the end of the second rubber , and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their last play , he became a looker - on at the other , he found his niece the object of attentions , or rather of professions , of a somewhat pointed character . Henry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about Thornton Lacey ; and not being able to catch Edmund ’s ear , was detailing it to his fair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness .
Edmund Bertram	Sir Thomas , politely bowing , replied , “ It is the only way , sir , in which I could _ not _ wish you established as a permanent neighbour ; but I hope , and believe , that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund , am I saying too much ? ”
Edmund Bertram	Edmund , on this appeal , had first to hear what was going on ; but , on understanding the question , was at no loss for an answer .
Edmund Bertram	“ Certainly , sir , I have no idea but of residence .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund might , in the common phrase , do the duty of Thornton , that is , he might read prayers and preach , without giving up Mansfield Park : he might ride over every Sunday , to a house nominally inhabited , and go through divine service ; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day , for three or four hours , if that would content him .
Edmund Bertram	He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey ; and that if he does not live among his parishioners , and prove himself , by constant attention , their well - wisher and friend , he does very little either for their good or his own . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Sir Thomas , ” said Edmund , “ undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish priest .
Edmund Bertram	One of whom , having never before understood that Thornton was so soon and so completely to be his home , was pondering with downcast eyes on what it would be _ not _ to see Edmund every day ; and the other , startled from the agreeable fancies she had been previously indulging on the strength of her brother ’s description , no longer able , in the picture she had been forming of a future Thornton , to shut out the church , sink the clergyman , and see only the respectable , elegant , modernised , and occasional residence of a man of independent fortune , was considering Sir Thomas , with decided ill - will , as the destroyer of all this , and suffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his character and manner commanded , and from not daring to relieve herself by a single attempt at throwing ridicule on his cause . All the agreeable of _ her _ speculation was over for that hour .
Edmund Bertram	My dear Sir Thomas , we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you , and Edmund and William . ” Sir Thomas could not dissent , as it had been his own arrangement , previously communicated to his wife and sister ; but _ that _ seemed forgotten by Mrs. Norris , who must fancy that she settled it all herself .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny ’s last feeling in the visit was disappointment : for the shawl which Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round her shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford ’s quicker hand , and she was obliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention .
Edmund Bertram	Such a victory over Edmund ’s discretion had been beyond their hopes , and was most delightful .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund might still look grave , and say he did not like the scheme in general , and must disapprove the play in particular ; their point was gained : he was to act , and he was driven to it by the force of selfish inclinations only .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund had descended from that moral elevation which he had maintained before , and they were both as much the better as the happier for the descent .
Edmund Bertram	They behaved very well , however , to _ him _ on the occasion , betraying no exultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth , and seemed to think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of Charles Maddox , as if they had been forced into admitting him against their inclination .
Edmund Bertram	A stranger among them would have been the destruction of all their comfort ” ; and when Edmund , pursuing that idea , gave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience , they were ready , in the complaisance of the moment , to promise anything .
Edmund Bertram	Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his dress , Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt ’s last scene with the Baron admitted a good deal of action and emphasis , and Mr. Rushworth undertook to count his speeches .
Edmund Bertram	There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this change in Edmund ; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers , and entered with such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole affair as could have but one effect on him .
Edmund Bertram	“ He was certainly right in respecting such feelings ; he was glad he had determined on it . ”
Edmund Bertram	One advantage resulted from it to Fanny : at the earnest request of Miss Crawford , Mrs. Grant had , with her usual good - humour , agreed to undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted ; and this was all that occurred to gladden _ her _ heart during the day ; and even this , when imparted by Edmund , brought a pang with it , for it was Miss
Edmund Bertram	Her heart and her judgment were equally against Edmund ’s decision
Edmund Bertram	: she could not acquit his unsteadiness , and his happiness under it made her wretched .
Edmund Bertram	I often think of Mr. Rushworth ’s property and independence , and wish them in other hands ; but I never think of him .
Edmund Bertram	I am sure _ Julia _ does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends
Edmund Bertram	, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . ” “ I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth ’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . ” “ If you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . ”
Edmund Bertram	Edmund , between his theatrical and his real part , between Miss Crawford ’s claims and his own conduct , between love and consistency , was equally unobservant ; and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company , superintending their various dresses with economical expedient , for which nobody thanked her , and saving , with delighted integrity , half a crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas , to have leisure for watching the behaviour , or guarding the happiness of his daughters .
Edmund Bertram	I am not comfortable without it . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Oh , cousin ! ” “ If you are against me , I ought to distrust myself , and yet — But it is absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way , riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act — no matter whom : the look of a gentleman is to be enough .
Edmund Bertram	I thought _ you _ would have entered more into Miss Crawford ’s feelings . ” “ No doubt she will be very glad .
Edmund Bertram	It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ She _ was _ very kind , indeed , and I am glad to have her spared ” ...
Edmund Bertram	Edmund was satisfied . “ I shall walk down immediately after breakfast , ” said he , “ and am sure of giving pleasure there .
Edmund Bertram	And now , dear Fanny , I will not interrupt you any longer .
Edmund Bertram	But I could not be easy till I had spoken to you , and come to a decision .
Edmund Bertram	Sleeping or waking , my head has been full of this matter all night .
Edmund Bertram	It is an evil , but I am certainly making it less than it might be .
Edmund Bertram	If Tom is up , I shall go to him directly and get it over , and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good - humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity .
Edmund Bertram	_ You _ , in the meanwhile , will be taking a trip into China , I suppose .
Edmund Bertram	After all his objections — objections so just and so public !
Edmund Bertram	After all that she had heard him say , and seen him look , and known him to be feeling .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund so inconsistent !
Edmund Bertram	Was he not deceiving himself ?
Edmund Bertram	Was he not wrong ?
Edmund Bertram	The doubts and alarms as to her own conduct , which had previously distressed her , and which had all slept while she listened to him , were become of little consequence now .
Edmund Bertram	“ Fanny , ” said he directly , leaving his seat and his pen , and meeting her with something in his hand , “ I beg your pardon for being here .
Edmund Bertram	I came to look for you , and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in , was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand .
Edmund Bertram	You will find the beginning of a note to yourself ; but I can now speak my business , which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle — a chain for William ’s cross .
Edmund Bertram	You ought to have had it a week ago , but there has been a delay from my brother ’s not being in town by several days so soon as I expected ; and I have only just now received it at Northampton .
Edmund Bertram	I hope you will like the chain itself , Fanny .
Edmund Bertram	I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste ; but , at any rate , I know you will be kind to my intentions , and consider it , as it really is , a token of the love of one of your oldest friends .
Edmund Bertram	And so saying , he was hurrying away , before Fanny , overpowered by a thousand feelings of pain and pleasure , could attempt to speak ; but quickened by one sovereign wish , she then called out , “ Oh !
Edmund Bertram	cousin
Edmund Bertram	He turned back .
Edmund Bertram	“ I can not attempt to thank you , ” she continued , in a very agitated manner ; “ thanks are out of the question .
Edmund Bertram	Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond — ” “ If that is all you have to say , Fanny ” smiling and turning away again .
Edmund Bertram	I want to consult you . ”
Edmund Bertram	Almost unconsciously she had now undone the parcel he had just put into her hand , and seeing before her , in all the niceness of jewellers ’ packing , a plain gold chain , perfectly simple and neat , she could not help bursting forth again , “ Oh , this is beautiful indeed !
Edmund Bertram	Oh , cousin , you do not know how acceptable it is . ”
Edmund Bertram	Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour without saying another word ; but Edmund , after waiting a moment , obliged her to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying , “ But what is it that you want to consult me about ?
Edmund Bertram	It was about the necklace , which she was now most earnestly longing to return , and hoped to obtain his approbation of her doing .
Edmund Bertram	for Edmund was so struck with the circumstance , so delighted with what Miss Crawford had done , so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct between them , that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one pleasure over his own mind , though it might have its drawback .
Edmund Bertram	It was some time before she could get his attention to her plan , or any answer to her demand of his opinion : he was in a reverie of fond reflection , uttering only now and then a few half - sentences of praise ; but when he did awake and understand , he was very decided in opposing what she wished .
Edmund Bertram	I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise , ” he repeated , his voice sinking a little , “ between the two dearest objects I have on earth .
Edmund Bertram	He was gone as he spoke ; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself as she could .
Edmund Bertram	She was one of his two dearest — that must support her .
Edmund Bertram	She had never heard him speak so openly before , and though it told her no more than what she had long perceived , it was a stab , for it told of his own convictions and views .
Edmund Bertram	He would marry Miss Crawford .
Edmund Bertram	It was a stab , in spite of every long - standing expectation ; and she was obliged to repeat again and again , that she was one of his two dearest , before the words gave her any sensation .
Edmund Bertram	Could she believe Miss Crawford to deserve him , it would be — oh , how different would it be — how far more tolerable !
Edmund Bertram	But he was deceived in her : he gave her merits which she had not ; her faults were what they had ever been , but he saw them no longer .
Edmund Bertram	Till she had shed many tears over this deception , Fanny could not subdue her agitation ; and the dejection which followed could only be relieved by the influence of fervent prayers for his happiness .
Edmund Bertram	It was her intention , as she felt it to be her duty , to try to overcome all that was excessive , all that bordered on selfishness , in her affection for Edmund .
Edmund Bertram	To think of him as Miss Crawford might be justified in thinking , would in her be insanity .
Edmund Bertram	To her he could be nothing under any circumstances ; nothing dearer than a friend .
Edmund Bertram	She would endeavour to be rational , and to deserve the right of judging of Miss Crawford ’s character , and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound intellect and an honest heart . She had all the heroism of principle , and was determined to do her duty ; but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature , let her not be much wondered at , if , after making all these good resolutions on the side of self - government , she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund had begun writing to her , as a treasure beyond all her hopes , and reading with the tenderest emotion these words , “ My very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept ” locked it up with the chain , as the dearest part of the gift .
Edmund Bertram	It was the only thing approaching to a letter which she had ever received from him ; she might
Edmund Bertram	Never were such characters cut by any other human being as Edmund ’s commonest handwriting gave !
Edmund Bertram	To dance without much observation or any extraordinary fatigue , to have strength and partners for about half the evening , to dance a little with Edmund , and not a great deal with Mr. Crawford , to see William enjoy himself , and be able to keep away from her aunt Norris , was the height of her ambition , and seemed to comprehend her greatest possibility of happiness .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund , she had too much reason to suppose , was at the Parsonage ; and left alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris , who was cross because the housekeeper would have her own way with the supper , and whom _ she _ could not avoid though the housekeeper might , Fanny was worn down at last to think everything an evil belonging to the ball , and when sent off with a parting worry to dress , moved as languidly towards her own room , and felt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no share in it .
Edmund Bertram	As she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday ; it had been about the same hour that she had returned from the Parsonage , and found Edmund in the East room .
Edmund Bertram	“ Suppose I were to find him there again to - day ! ” said she to herself , in a fond indulgence of fancy .
Edmund Bertram	Starting and looking up , she saw , across the lobby she had just reached , Edmund himself , standing at the head of a different staircase .
Edmund Bertram	He came towards her .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny , not liking to complain , found it easiest to make no answer ; and though he looked at her with his usual kindness , she believed he had soon ceased to think of her countenance .
Edmund Bertram	He did not appear in spirits : something unconnected with her was probably amiss .
Edmund Bertram	“ I come from Dr. Grant ’s , ” said Edmund presently .
Edmund Bertram	“ You may guess my errand there , Fanny . ”
Edmund Bertram	And he looked so conscious , that Fanny could think but of one errand , which turned her too sick for speech .
Edmund Bertram	“ I wished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances , ” was the explanation that followed , and brought Fanny to life again , enabling her , as she found she was expected to speak , to utter something like an inquiry as to the result .
Edmund Bertram	“ Yes , ” he answered , “ she is engaged to me ; but ” ( with a smile that did not sit easy ) “ she says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me .
Edmund Bertram	I think , I hope , I am sure she is not serious ; but I would rather not hear it .
Edmund Bertram	For my own sake , I could wish there had been no ball just at — I mean not this very week , this very day ; to - morrow I leave home . ”
Edmund Bertram	Fanny struggled for speech , and said , “ I am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you .
Edmund Bertram	I know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own , but the influence of her former companions makes her seem — gives to her conversation , to her professed opinions , sometimes a tinge of wrong .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund could not but agree to it .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment , and therefore , after a moment ’s consideration , said , “ If you only want me as a listener , cousin , I will be as useful as I can ; but I am not qualified for an adviser .
Edmund Bertram	“ Dearest Fanny ! ” cried Edmund , pressing her hand to his lips with almost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford ’s , “ you are all considerate thought !
Edmund Bertram	“ Dearest Fanny ! ” cried Edmund , pressing her hand to his lips with almost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford ’s , “ you are all considerate thought !
Edmund Bertram	I begin to think it most improbable : the chances grow less and less ; and even if it should , there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of , for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples ; and if they are removed , it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had .
Edmund Bertram	You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said ; but you have always known my opinion of her ; you can bear me witness , Fanny , that I have never been blinded .
Edmund Bertram	You need not fear me ; I have almost given up
Edmund Bertram	every serious idea of her ; but I must be a blockhead indeed , if , whatever befell me , I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude . ” He had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen .
Edmund Bertram	He had said enough to give Fanny some happier feelings than she had lately known , and with a brighter look , she answered , “ Yes , cousin , I am convinced that _ you _ would be incapable of anything else , though perhaps some might not .
Edmund Bertram	I can not be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say .
Edmund Bertram	Do not check yourself .
Edmund Bertram	Tell me whatever you like .
Edmund Bertram	For Fanny ’s present comfort it was concluded , perhaps , at the happiest moment : had he been able to talk another five minutes , there is no saying that he might not have talked away all Miss Crawford ’s faults and his own despondence .
Edmund Bertram	But as it was , they parted with looks on his side of grateful affection , and with some very precious sensations on hers .
Edmund Bertram	She had , to oblige Edmund , resolved to wear it ; but it was too large for the purpose .
Edmund Bertram	His , therefore , must be worn ; and having , with delightful feelings , joined the chain and the cross — those memorials of the two most beloved of her heart , those dearest tokens so formed for each other by everything real and imaginary — and put them round her neck , and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were , she was able , without an effort , to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford ’s necklace too .
Edmund Bertram	The situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect from any of the rooms ; and while Fanny and some of the others were attending Mrs. Rushworth , Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking his head at the windows .
Edmund Bertram	“ I am disappointed , ” said she , in a low voice , to Edmund .
Edmund Bertram	No banners , cousin , to be ‘ blown by the night wind of heaven . ’
Edmund Bertram	” “ Every generation has its improvements , ” said Miss Crawford , with a smile , to Edmund .
Edmund Bertram	Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford ; and Edmund , Fanny , and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together .
Edmund Bertram	“ _ That _ is hardly Fanny ’s idea of a family assembling , ” said Edmund .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny coloured and looked at Edmund , but felt too angry for speech ; and he needed a little recollection before he could say , “ Your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects .
Edmund Bertram	And she talked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the comprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his mother , and expose her sister to the whispered gallantries of her lover , while Mrs. Rushworth spoke with proper smiles and dignity of its being a most happy event to her whenever it took place .
Edmund Bertram	“ If Edmund were but in orders ! ” cried Julia , and running to where he stood with Miss Crawford and Fanny : “ My dear Edmund , if you were but in orders now , you might perform the ceremony directly .
Edmund Bertram	How unlucky that you are not ordained ; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ James , ” said Mrs. Rushworth to her son , “ I believe the wilderness will be new to all the party .
Edmund Bertram	Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth ; and when , after a little time , the others began to form into parties , these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund , Miss Crawford , and Fanny , who seemed as naturally to unite , and who , after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties , left them and walked on .
Edmund Bertram	“ A very praiseworthy practice , ” said Edmund , “ but not quite universal .
Edmund Bertram	I am one of the exceptions , and _ being _ one , must do something for myself . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ But why are you to be a clergyman ?
Edmund Bertram	I thought _ that _ was always the lot of the youngest , where there were many to chuse before him . ” “ Do you think the church itself never chosen , then ? ” “ _ Never _ is a black word .
Edmund Bertram	“ Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two , but I forestall you ; remember , I have forestalled you . ” “ You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a _ bon _ _ mot _ , for there is not the least wit in my nature .
Edmund Bertram	I am a very matter - of - fact , plain - spoken being , and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ My dear Fanny , ” cried Edmund , immediately drawing her arm within his , “ how thoughtless I have been !
Edmund Bertram	I hope you are not very tired .
Edmund Bertram	Perhaps , ” turning to Miss Crawford , “ my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm . ”
Edmund Bertram	She took it , however , as she spoke , and the gratification of having her do so , of feeling such a connexion for the first time , made him a little forgetful of Fanny .
Edmund Bertram	“ You scarcely touch me , ” said he .
Edmund Bertram	“ You do not make me of any use .
Edmund Bertram	At Oxford I have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street , and you are only a fly in the comparison . ”
Edmund Bertram	Do not you think we have ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Not half a mile , ” was his sturdy answer ; for he was not yet so much in love as to measure distance , or reckon time , with feminine lawlessness .
Edmund Bertram	I know nothing of your furlongs , but I am sure it is a very long wood , and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it ; and therefore , when I say that we have walked a mile in it , I must speak within compass .
Edmund Bertram	“ We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here , ” said Edmund , taking out his watch .
Edmund Bertram	“ Do you think we are walking four miles an hour ? ”
Edmund Bertram	do not attack me with your watch .
Edmund Bertram	I can not be dictated to by a watch . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I am afraid you are very tired , Fanny , ” said Edmund , observing her ; “ why would not you speak sooner ?
Edmund Bertram	Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon , Miss Crawford , except riding . ” “ How abominable in you , then , to let me engross her horse as I did all last week !
Edmund Bertram	I am ashamed of you and of myself , but it shall never happen again . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ _ Your _ attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny ’s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ That she should be tired now , however , gives me no surprise ; for there is nothing in the course of one ’s duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning : seeing a great house , dawdling from one room to another , straining one ’s eyes and one ’s attention , hearing what one does not understand , admiring what one does not care for .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund left the seat likewise .
Edmund Bertram	He still reasoned with her , but in vain .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an earnestness which she could not resist , and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin ’s care , but with great regret that she was not stronger .
Edmund Bertram	He did not understand her : he felt that he did not ; and therefore applied to Edmund to tell him how she stood affected on the present occasion , and whether she were more or less happy than she had been .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund did not discern any symptoms of regret , and thought his father a little unreasonable in supposing the first three or four days could produce any .
Edmund Bertram	What chiefly surprised Edmund was , that Crawford ’s sister , the friend and companion who had been so much to her , should not be more visibly regretted .
Edmund Bertram	He wondered that Fanny spoke so seldom of _ her _ , and had so little voluntarily to say of her concern at this separation .
Edmund Bertram	If she could have believed Mary ’s future fate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother ’s should be , if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant as she was much inclined to think his , she would have been light of heart indeed ; but the more she recollected and observed , the more deeply was she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for Miss Crawford ’s marrying Edmund than it had ever been before .
Edmund Bertram	love , but she did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny believed there was scarcely a second feeling in common between them ; and she may be forgiven by older sages for looking on the chance of Miss Crawford ’s future improvement as nearly desperate , for thinking that if Edmund ’s influence in this season of love had already done so little in clearing her judgment , and regulating her notions , his worth would be finally wasted on her even in years of matrimony . Experience might have hoped more for any young people so circumstanced , and impartiality would not have denied to Miss Crawford ’s nature that participation of the general nature of women which would lead her to adopt the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own .
Edmund Bertram	So the uniform remained at Portsmouth , and Edmund conjectured that before Fanny had any chance of seeing it , all its own freshness and all the freshness of its wearer ’s feelings must be worn away .
Edmund Bertram	So reasoned Edmund , till his father made him the confidant of a scheme which placed Fanny ’s chance of seeing the second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush in all his glory in another light .
Edmund Bertram	It had occurred to Sir Thomas , in one of his dignified musings , as a right and desirable measure ; but before he absolutely made up his mind , he consulted his son .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund considered it every way , and saw nothing but what was right .
Edmund Bertram	The thing was good in itself , and could not be done at a better time ; and he had no doubt of it being highly agreeable to Fanny .
Edmund Bertram	from it with some feelings of satisfaction , and views of good over and above what he had communicated to his son
Edmund Bertram	Afterwards , when familiarised with the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened , she could speak more largely to William and Edmund of what she felt ; but still there were emotions of tenderness that could not be clothed in words .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund , too — to be two months from _ him _ ( and perhaps she might be allowed to make her absence three ) must do her good .
Edmund Bertram	At a distance , unassailed by his looks or his kindness , and safe from the perpetual irritation of knowing his heart , and striving to avoid his confidence , she should be able to reason herself into a properer state ; she should be able to think of him as in London , and arranging everything there , without wretchedness .
Edmund Bertram	Mrs. Norris was left to settle the matter by herself ; and it ended , to the infinite joy of her nephew and niece , in the recollection
Edmund Bertram	So her poor dear sister Price was left to all the disappointment of her missing such an opportunity , and another twenty years ’ absence , perhaps , begun . Edmund ’s plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey , this absence of Fanny ’s .
Edmund Bertram	He too had a sacrifice to make to Mansfield Park as well as his aunt .
Edmund Bertram	He had intended , about this time , to be going to London ; but he could not leave his father and mother just when everybody else of most importance to their comfort was leaving them ; and with an effort , felt but not boasted of , he delayed for a week or two longer a journey which he was looking forward to with the hope of its fixing his happiness for ever .
Edmund Bertram	He told Fanny of it .
Edmund Bertram	Once afterwards she was alluded to by him .
Edmund Bertram	Lady Bertram had been telling her niece in the evening to write to her soon and often , and promising to be a good correspondent herself ; and Edmund , at a convenient moment , then added in a whisper , “ And _ I _ shall write to you , Fanny , when I have anything worth writing about , anything to say that I think you will like to hear , and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter . ”
Edmund Bertram	Had she doubted his meaning while she listened , the glow in his face , when she looked up at him , would have been decisive .
Edmund Bertram	That a letter from Edmund should be a subject of terror !
Edmund Bertram	She clung to her aunt , because she would miss her ; she kissed the hand of her uncle with struggling sobs , because she had displeased him ; and as for Edmund , she could neither speak , nor look , nor think , when the last moment came with
Edmund Bertram	_ him _
Edmund Bertram	it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving her the affectionate farewell of a brother . All this passed overnight , for the journey was to begin very early in the morning ; and when the small , diminished party met at breakfast , William and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage .
Edmund Bertram	” said Edmund
Edmund Bertram	the next day , after thinking some time on the subject himself
Edmund Bertram	” Having formed her mind and gained her affections , he had a good chance of her thinking like him ; though at this period , and on this subject , there began now to be some danger of dissimilarity , for he was in a line of admiration of Miss Crawford , which might lead him where Fanny could not follow .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund was at the Parsonage every day , to be indulged with his favourite instrument : one morning secured an invitation for the next ; for the lady could not be unwilling to have a listener , and every thing was soon in a fair train .
Edmund Bertram	Without studying the business , however , or knowing what he was about , Edmund was beginning , at the end of a week of such intercourse , to be a good deal in love ; and to the credit of the lady it may be added that , without his being a man of the world or an elder brother , without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk , he began to be agreeable to her .
Edmund Bertram	She felt it to be so , though she had not foreseen , and could hardly understand it ; for he was not pleasant by any common rule : he talked no nonsense ; he paid no compliments ; his opinions were unbending , his attentions tranquil and simple .
Edmund Bertram	There was a charm , perhaps , in his sincerity , his steadiness , his integrity , which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel , though not equal to discuss with herself .
Edmund Bertram	She did not think very much about it , however : he pleased her for the present ; she liked to have him near her ; it was enough .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning ; she would gladly have been there too , might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed , to hear the harp ; neither could she wonder that , when the evening stroll was over , and the two families parted again , he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home , while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park ; but she thought it a very bad exchange ; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and water for her , would rather go without it than not .
Edmund Bertram	She was a little surprised that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford , and not see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed , and of which _ she _ was almost always reminded by a something of the same nature whenever she was in her company ; but so it was .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund was fond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford , but he seemed to think it enough that the Admiral had since been spared ; and she scrupled to point out her own remarks to him , lest it should appear like ill - nature .
Edmund Bertram	The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride , which the former caught , soon after her being settled at Mansfield , from the example of the young ladies at the Park , and which , when Edmund ’s acquaintance with her increased , led to his encouraging the wish , and the offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts , as the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish .
Edmund Bertram	No pain , no injury , however , was designed by him to his cousin in this offer : _ she _ was not to lose a day ’s exercise by it .
Edmund Bertram	The mare was only to be taken down to the Parsonage half an hour before her ride were to begin ; and Fanny , on its being first proposed , so far from feeling slighted , was almost over - powered with gratitude that he should be asking her leave for it .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund , who had taken down the mare and presided at the whole ,
Edmund Bertram	Active and fearless , and though rather small , strongly made , she seemed formed for a horsewoman ; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise , something was probably added in Edmund ’s attendance and instructions , and something more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in general by her early progress , to make her unwilling to dismount .
Edmund Bertram	To avoid her aunt , and look for him , she went out .
Edmund Bertram	The houses , though scarcely half a mile apart , were not within sight of each other ; but , by walking fifty yards from the hall door , she could look down the park , and command a view of the Parsonage and all its demesnes , gently rising beyond the village road ; and in Dr. Grant ’s meadow she immediately saw the group — Edmund and Miss Crawford both on horse - back , riding side by side , Dr. and Mrs. Grant , and Mr. Crawford , with two or three grooms , standing about and looking on .
Edmund Bertram	It was a sound which did not make _ her _ cheerful ; she wondered that Edmund should forget her , and felt a pang .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund was close to her ; he was speaking to her ; he was evidently directing her management of the bridle ; he had hold of her hand ; she saw it , or the imagination supplied what the eye could not reach .
Edmund Bertram	She must not wonder at all this ; what could be more natural than that Edmund should be making himself useful , and proving his good - nature by any one ?
Edmund Bertram	She could not but think , indeed , that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved him the trouble ; that it would have been particularly proper and becoming in a brother to have done it himself ; but Mr. Crawford , with all his boasted good - nature , and all his coachmanship , probably knew nothing of the matter , and had no active kindness in comparison of Edmund .
Edmund Bertram	Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by seeing the party in the meadow disperse , and Miss Crawford still on horseback , but attended by Edmund on foot , pass through a gate into the lane , and so into the park , and make towards the spot where she stood .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny ’s answer was extremely civil , and Edmund added his conviction that she could be in no hurry .
Edmund Bertram	“ For there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes , ” said he , “ and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner : clouds are now coming up , and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then .
Edmund Bertram	I wish _ you _ may not be fatigued by so much exercise .
Edmund Bertram	I wish you had saved yourself this walk home .
Edmund Bertram	” “ No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse , I assure you , ” said she , as she sprang down with his help
Edmund Bertram	When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ride the next day .
Edmund Bertram	“ No , I do not know — not if you want the mare , ” was her answer .
Edmund Bertram	“ I do not want her at all for myself , ” said he ; “ but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home , I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time — for a whole morning , in short .
Edmund Bertram	She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common : Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views , and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it .
Edmund Bertram	You know I am strong enough now to walk very well . ”
Edmund Bertram	Edmund looked pleased , which must be Fanny ’s comfort , and the ride to Mansfield Common took place the next morning : the party included all the young people but herself , and was much enjoyed at the time , and doubly enjoyed again in the evening discussion .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund and Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage , and _ she _ was excluded .
Edmund Bertram	Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing - room , fresh with the evening air , glowing and cheerful , the very reverse of what they found in the three ladies sitting there , for Maria would scarcely raise her eyes from her book , and Lady Bertram was half - asleep ; and even Mrs. Norris , discomposed by her niece ’s ill - humour , and having asked one or two questions about the dinner , which were not immediately attended to , seemed almost determined to say no more .
Edmund Bertram	For a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in their praise of the night and their remarks on the stars , to think beyond themselves ; but when the first pause came , Edmund , looking around , said , “ But where is Fanny ?
Edmund Bertram	You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa . ” Before half this was said , Fanny was returned to her seat at the table , and had taken up her work again ; and Julia , who was in high good - humour , from the pleasures of the day , did her the justice of exclaiming , “ I must say , ma’am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . ” “ Fanny , ” said Edmund , after looking at her attentively , “ I am sure you have the headache . ” She could not deny it , but said it was not very bad . “ I can hardly believe you , ” he replied ; “ I know your looks too well .
Edmund Bertram	“ Yes , indeed , Edmund , ” added her ladyship , who had been thoroughly awakened by Mrs. Norris ’s sharp reprimand to Fanny ; “ I was out above an hour .
Edmund Bertram	“ She has got it , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time . ” “ What ! ” cried Edmund ; “ has she been walking as well as cutting roses ; walking across the hot park to your house , and doing it twice , ma’am ?
Edmund Bertram	Edmund got up and walked about the room , saying , “ And could nobody be employed on such an errand but Fanny ?
Edmund Bertram	Upon my word , ma’am , it has been a very ill - managed business . ”
Edmund Bertram	” “ I wish Fanny had half your strength , ma’am . ” “ If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise , she would not be knocked up so soon .
Edmund Bertram	Between ourselves , Edmund , ” nodding significantly at his mother , “ it was cutting the roses , and dawdling about in the flower - garden , that did the mischief . ” “ I am afraid it was , indeed , ” said the more candid Lady Bertram ,
Edmund Bertram	Edmund said no more to either lady ; but going quietly to another table , on which the supper - tray yet remained , brought a glass of Madeira to Fanny , and obliged her to drink the greater part
Edmund Bertram	Vexed as Edmund was with his mother and aunt , he was still more angry with himself .
Edmund Bertram	His own forgetfulness of her was worse than anything which they had done .
Edmund Bertram	He was ashamed to think that for four days together she had not had the power of riding , and very seriously resolved , however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of Miss Crawford ’s , that it should never happen again .
Edmund Bertram	As she leant on the sofa , to which she had retreated that she might not be seen , the pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head ; and the sudden change which Edmund ’s kindness had then occasioned , made her hardly know how to support herself .
Edmund Bertram	I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche , and Edmund can go on horseback , you know , sister , and Fanny will stay at home with you .
Edmund Bertram	Lady Bertram made no objection ; and every one concerned in the going was forward in expressing their ready concurrence , excepting Edmund , who heard it all and said nothing .
Edmund Bertram	Lady Bertram could think nothing less , and Fanny shared her aunt ’s security , till she received a few lines from Edmund , written purposely to give her a clearer idea of his brother ’s situation , and acquaint her with the apprehensions which he and his father had imbibed from the physician with respect to some strong hectic symptoms , which seemed to seize the frame on the departure of the fever .
Edmund Bertram	They were apprehensive for his lungs .
Edmund Bertram	A very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient and the sickroom in a juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram ’s sheets of paper could do .
Edmund Bertram	There was hardly any one in the house who might not have described , from personal observation , better than herself ; not one who was not more useful at times to her son .
Edmund Bertram	She could do nothing but glide in quietly and look at him ; but when able to talk or be talked to , or read to , Edmund was the companion he preferred .
Edmund Bertram	His aunt worried him by her cares , and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down his conversation or his voice to the level of irritation and feebleness .
Edmund Bertram	His aunt worried him by her cares , and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down his conversation or his voice to the level of irritation and feebleness .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund was all in all .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny would certainly believe him so at least , and must find that her estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared as the attendant , supporter , cheerer of a suffering brother .
Edmund Bertram	There was not only the debility of recent illness to assist : there was also , as she now learnt , nerves much affected , spirits much depressed to calm and raise , and her own imagination added that there must be a mind to be properly guided . The family were not consumptive , and she was more inclined to hope than fear for her cousin , except when she thought of Miss Crawford ; but Miss Crawford gave her the idea of being the child of good luck , and to her selfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only son . Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund ’s letter had this postscript .
Edmund Bertram	“ On the subject of my last , I had actually begun a letter when called away by Tom ’s illness , but I have now changed my mind , and fear to trust the influence of friends .
Edmund Bertram	When Tom is better , I shall go . ”
Edmund Bertram	A line occasionally added by Edmund to his mother ’s letter was enough for Fanny ’s information .

Edmund Bertram	; _ her _ attachment to Edmund had been respectable , the most respectable part of her character ; her friendship for herself had at least been blameless .
Edmund Bertram	Poor Sir Thomas will feel it dreadfully .

Edmund Bertram	The Aylmers are pleasant people ; and her husband away , she can have nothing but enjoyment .
Edmund Bertram	I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down to Bath , to fetch his mother ; but how will she and the dowager agree in one house ?
Edmund Bertram	Henry is not at hand
Edmund Bertram	, so I have nothing to say from him .
Edmund Bertram	Do not you think Edmund would have been in town again long ago , but for this illness?—Yours ever , Mary . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in , but he brings no intelligence to prevent my sending it .
Edmund Bertram	Mrs. R. knows a decline is apprehended ; he saw her this morning : she returns to Wimpole Street
Edmund Bertram	Now do not make yourself uneasy with any queer fancies because he has been spending a few days at Richmond .
Edmund Bertram	He does it every spring .
Edmund Bertram	Be assured he cares for nobody but you .
Edmund Bertram	At this very moment he is wild to see you , and occupied only in contriving the means for doing so , and for making his pleasure conduce to yours .
Edmund Bertram	In proof , he repeats , and more eagerly , what he said at Portsmouth about our conveying you home , and I join him in it with all my soul .
Edmund Bertram	He and I can go to the Parsonage , you know , and be no trouble to our friends at Mansfield Park .
Edmund Bertram	To be finding herself , perhaps within three days , transported to Mansfield , was an image of the greatest felicity , but it would have been a material drawback to be owing such felicity to persons in whose feelings and conduct , at the present moment , she saw so much to condemn : the sister ’s feelings , the brother ’s conduct , _ her _ cold - hearted ambition , _ his _ thoughtless vanity .
Edmund Bertram	To have him still the acquaintance , the flirt perhaps , of Mrs. Rushworth !
Edmund Bertram	She had thought better of him .
Edmund Bertram	Happily , however , she was not left to weigh and decide between opposite inclinations and doubtful notions of right ; there was no occasion to determine whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not .
Edmund Bertram	as her cousin ’s illness had continued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary , she must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present , and that she should be felt an encumbrance . ” Her representation of her cousin ’s state at this time was exactly according to her own belief of it , and such as she supposed would convey to the sanguine mind of her correspondent the hope of everything she was wishing for .

Edmund Bertram	Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman , it seemed , under certain conditions of wealth ; and this , she suspected , was all the conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate himself upon .
Edmund Bertram	His warm regard , his kind expressions , his confidential treatment , touched her strongly .
Edmund Bertram	He was only too good to everybody .
Edmund Bertram	Lady Bertram rather shone in the epistolary line , having early in her marriage , from the want of other employment , and the circumstance of Sir Thomas ’s being in Parliament , got into the way of making and keeping correspondents , and formed for herself a very creditable , common - place , amplifying style , so that a very little matter was enough for her : she could not do entirely without any ; she must have something to write about , even to her niece ; and being so soon to lose all the benefit of Dr. Grant ’s gouty symptoms and Mrs. Grant ’s morning calls , it was very hard upon her to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she could put them to .
Edmund Bertram	Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund ’s letter , Fanny had one from her aunt , beginning thus — “ My Dear Fanny,—I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming intelligence , which I make no doubt will give you much concern ” . This was a great deal better than to have to take up the pen to acquaint her with all the particulars of the Grants ’ intended journey , for the present intelligence was of a nature to promise occupation for the pen for many days to come , being no less than the dangerous illness of her eldest son , of which they had received notice by express a few hours before .
Edmund Bertram	Instead of being soon well enough to follow his friends , as he had then hoped , his disorder increased considerably , and it was not long before he thought so ill of himself as to be as ready as his physician to have a letter despatched to Mansfield . “ This distressing intelligence , as you may suppose , ” observed her ladyship , after giving the substance of it , “ has agitated us exceedingly , and we can not prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive for the poor invalid , whose state Sir Thomas fears may be very critical ; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother immediately , but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on this distressing occasion , as it would be too trying for me .
Edmund Bertram	We shall greatly miss Edmund in our small circle , but I trust and hope he will
Edmund Bertram	find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be apprehended , and that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield shortly , which Sir Thomas proposes should be done , and thinks best on
Edmund Bertram	Tom dangerously ill , Edmund gone to attend him , and the sadly small party remaining at Mansfield , were cares to shut out every other care , or almost every other .
Edmund Bertram	She could just find selfishness enough to wonder whether Edmund _ had _ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came , but no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate and disinterestedly anxious .
Edmund Bertram	Her aunt did not neglect her : she wrote again and again ; they were receiving frequent accounts from Edmund , and these accounts were as regularly transmitted to Fanny , in the same diffuse style , and the same medley of trusts , hopes , and fears , all following and producing each other at haphazard .
Edmund Bertram	I am quite grieved for him , and very much frightened , and so is Sir Thomas ; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me .
Edmund Bertram	But Sir Thomas hopes he will be better to - morrow , and says we must consider his journey . ” The real solicitude now awakened in the maternal bosom was not soon over .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund was almost as welcome to his brother as Fanny to her aunt ; but Mrs. Norris , instead of having comfort from either , was but the more irritated by the sight of the person whom , in the blindness of her anger , she could have charged as the daemon of the piece .
Edmund Bertram	Lady Bertram could not give her much time , or many words , but she felt her , as Fanny ’s sister , to have a claim at Mansfield , and was ready to kiss and like her ; and Susan was more than satisfied , for she came perfectly aware that nothing but ill - humour was to be expected from aunt Norris ; and was so provided with happiness , so strong in that best of blessings , an escape from many certain evils , that she could have stood against a great deal more indifference than she met with from the others . She was now left a good deal to herself , to get acquainted with the house and grounds as she could , and spent her days very happily in so doing , while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut up , or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them , at this time , for everything like comfort ; Edmund trying to bury his own feelings in exertions for the relief of his brother ’s , and Fanny
Edmund Bertram	Sir Thomas set off , Edmund would go with him , and the others had been left in a state of wretchedness , inferior only to what followed the receipt of the next letters from London .
Edmund Bertram	He could have no comfort but in Edmund .
Edmund Bertram	Every other child must be racking his heart .
Edmund Bertram	His displeasure against herself she trusted , reasoning differently from Mrs. Norris , would now be done away .
Edmund Bertram	Mr. Crawford would have fully acquitted her conduct in refusing him ; but this , though most material to herself , would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas .
Edmund Bertram	Her uncle ’s displeasure was terrible to her ; but what could her justification or her gratitude and attachment do for him ?
Edmund Bertram	His stay must be on Edmund alone .
Edmund Bertram	She was mistaken , however , in supposing that Edmund gave his father no present pain .
Edmund Bertram	It was of a much less poignant nature than what the others excited ; but Sir Thomas was considering his happiness as very deeply involved in the offence of his sister and friend ; cut off by it , as he must be , from the woman whom he had been pursuing with undoubted attachment and strong probability of success ; and who , in everything but this despicable brother , would have been so eligible a connexion
Edmund Bertram	He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf , in addition to all the rest , when they were in town : he had seen or conjectured his feelings ; and , having reason to think that one interview with Miss Crawford had taken place , from which Edmund derived only increased distress , had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him out of town , and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt , with a view to his relief and benefit , no less than theirs .
Edmund Bertram	That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit of a doubt with Fanny ; and yet , till she knew that he felt the same , her own conviction was insufficient .
Edmund Bertram	She thought he did , but she wanted to be assured of it .
Edmund Bertram	If he would now speak to her with the unreserve which had sometimes been too much for her before , it would be most consoling ; but _ that _ she found was not to be .
Edmund Bertram	She seldom saw him : never alone .
Edmund Bertram	He probably avoided being alone with her .
Edmund Bertram	That his judgment submitted to all his own peculiar and bitter share of this family affliction , but that it was too keenly felt to be a subject of the slightest communication .
Edmund Bertram	This must be his state .
Edmund Bertram	He yielded , but it was with agonies which did not admit of speech .
Edmund Bertram	Long , long would it be ere Miss Crawford ’s name passed his lips again , or she could hope for a renewal of such confidential intercourse as had been .
Edmund Bertram	They reached Mansfield on Thursday , and it was not till Sunday evening that Edmund began to talk to her on the subject .
Edmund Bertram	Sitting with her on Sunday evening — a wet Sunday evening — the very time of all others when , if a friend is at hand , the heart must be opened , and everything told ; no one else in the room , except his mother , who , after hearing an affecting sermon , had cried herself to sleep , it was impossible not to speak ; and so , with the usual beginnings , hardly to be traced as to what came first , and the usual declaration that if she would listen to him for a few minutes , he should be very brief , and certainly never tax her kindness in the same way again ; she need not fear a repetition ; it would be a subject prohibited entirely : he entered upon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the first interest to himself , to one of whose affectionate sympathy he was quite convinced .
Edmund Bertram	How Fanny listened , with what curiosity and concern , what pain and what delight , how the agitation of his voice was watched , and how carefully her own eyes were fixed on any object but himself , may be imagined .
Edmund Bertram	He had seen Miss Crawford .
Edmund Bertram	He had been invited to see her .
Edmund Bertram	He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call ; and regarding it as what was meant to be the last , last interview of friendship , and investing her with all the feelings of shame and wretchedness which Crawford ’s sister ought to have known , he had gone to her in such a state of mind , so softened , so devoted , as made it for a few moments impossible to Fanny ’s fears that it should be the last .
Edmund Bertram	But as he proceeded in his story , these fears were over .
Edmund Bertram	She had met him , he said , with a serious — certainly a serious — even an agitated air ; but before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence , she had introduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him .
Edmund Bertram	After a little reflection , he went on with a sort of desperate calmness .
Edmund Bertram	“ I will tell you everything , and then have done for ever .
Edmund Bertram	” He stopt .
Edmund Bertram	“ And what , ” said Fanny ( believing herself required to speak ) , “ what could you say ? ”
Edmund Bertram	I was like a man stunned .
Edmund Bertram	My dearest Fanny , I am giving you , I hope , more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been — but what never can be now .
Edmund Bertram	You do not wish me to be silent ?
Edmund Bertram	If you do , give me but a look , a word , and I
Edmund Bertram	“ Thank God , ” said he .
Edmund Bertram	My eyes are opened . ”
Edmund Bertram	I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings .
Edmund Bertram	She would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one , and though I may deceive myself , I can not but think that for me , for my feelings , she would—.
Edmund Bertram	Perhaps it is best for me , since it leaves me so little to regret .
Edmund Bertram	Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing her , rather than have to think of her as I do .
Edmund Bertram	I told her so . ” “ Did you ? ” “ Yes ; when I left her I told her so . ”
Edmund Bertram	She spoke of it , Fanny , with a steadier voice than I can . ”
Edmund Bertram	He was obliged to pause more than once as he continued .
Edmund Bertram	If by any officious exertions of his , she is induced to leave Henry ’s protection , there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him .
Edmund Bertram	After repeating this , Edmund was so much affected that Fanny , watching him with silent , but most tender concern , was almost sorry that the subject had been entered on at all .
Edmund Bertram	It was long before he could speak again .
Edmund Bertram	At last , “ Now , Fanny , ” said he , “ I shall soon have done .
Edmund Bertram	I have told you the substance of all that she said .
Edmund Bertram	And what an acquaintance has it been ! How have I been deceived !
Edmund Bertram	I thank you for your patience , Fanny .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny , now at liberty to speak openly , felt more than justified in adding to his knowledge of her real character , by some hint of what share his brother ’s state of health might be supposed to have in her wish for a complete reconciliation .
Edmund Bertram	It would have been a vast deal pleasanter to have had her more disinterested in her attachment ; but his vanity was not of a strength to fight long against reason .
Edmund Bertram	He
Edmund Bertram	submitted to believe that Tom ’s illness had influenced her , only reserving for himself this consoling thought , that considering the many counteractions of opposing habits , she had certainly been _ more _ attached to him than could have been expected , and for his sake been more near doing right .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny thought exactly the same ; and they were also quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect , the indelible impression , which such a disappointment must make on his mind .
Edmund Bertram	Time would undoubtedly abate somewhat of his sufferings , but still it was a sort of thing which he never could get entirely the better of ; and as to his ever meeting with any other woman who could — it was too impossible to be named but with indignation .
Edmund Bertram	Fanny ’s friendship was all that he had to cling to .
Edmund Bertram	acknowledged , however , that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men , that two such young men were not often seen together even in London , and that their manners , particularly those of the eldest , were very good . _ He _ had been much in London , and had more liveliness and gallantry than Edmund , and must , therefore , be preferred ; and , indeed , his being the eldest was another strong claim .
Edmund Bertram	Tom Bertram must have been thought pleasant , indeed , at any rate ; he was the sort of young man to be generally liked , his agreeableness was of the kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a higher stamp , for he had easy manners , excellent spirits , a large acquaintance , and a great deal to say ; and the reversion of Mansfield Park , and a baronetcy , did no harm to all this .
Edmund Bertram	Miss Crawford soon felt that he and his situation might do .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund , to whom this was chiefly addressed , replied , “ I believe I know what you mean , but I will not undertake to answer the question .
Edmund Bertram	My
Edmund Bertram	She has the age and sense of a woman , but the outs and not outs are beyond me .
Edmund Bertram	You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson . ”
Edmund Bertram	But I _ will _ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure , if you will tell me what about .
Edmund Bertram	Edmund , you have heard me mention Charles Anderson .
Edmund Bertram	“ The error is plain enough , ” said the less courteous Edmund ; “ such girls are ill brought up .
Edmund Bertram	— you have heard me speak of Sneyd , Edmund — his father , and mother , and sisters , were there , all new to me .
Edmund Bertram	Does she dine out every where , as well as at my sister ’s ? ” “ No , ” replied Edmund ; “ I do not think she has ever been to a ball .
Edmund Bertram	My mother seldom goes into company herself , and dines nowhere but with Mrs. Grant , and Fanny stays at home with _ her _ . ”
Maria Bertram	Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who , as the clandestine , insidious , treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram , had been her abhorrence , whom she had hated to see or to speak to , in whom she could believe no good quality to exist , and whose power , even of being agreeable , she had barely acknowledged .
Maria Bertram	And still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts , she soon afterwards added , “ And I will tell you what , Fanny , which is more than I did for Maria : the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy . ”
Maria Bertram	I then saw him behaving , as it appeared to me , so very improperly and unfeelingly — I may speak of it now because it is all over — so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth , not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him , and paying attentions to my cousin Maria , which — in short , at the time of the play , I received an impression which will never be got over .
Maria Bertram	Maria was wrong , Crawford was wrong , we were all wrong together ; but none so wrong as myself
Maria Bertram	I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of it ; but , if she could undertake the part , we must not be surprised at the rest .
Maria Bertram	“ Before the play , I am much mistaken if _ Julia _ did not think he was paying her attentions . ”
Maria Bertram	“ Julia !
Maria Bertram	I have heard before from some one of his being in love with Julia ; but I could never see anything of it .
Maria Bertram	Miss Crawford accepted the part very readily ; and soon after Miss Bertram ’s return from the Parsonage , Mr. Rushworth arrived , and another character was consequently cast .
Maria Bertram	He had the offer of Count Cassel and Anhalt , and at first did not know which to chuse , and wanted Miss Bertram to direct him ; but upon being made to understand the different style of the characters , and which was which , and recollecting that he had once seen the play in London , and had thought Anhalt a very stupid fellow , he soon decided for the Count .
Maria Bertram	Miss Bertram approved the decision , for the less he had to learn the better ; and though she could not sympathise in his wish that the Count and Agatha might be to act together , nor wait very patiently while he was slowly turning over the
Maria Bertram	, she very kindly took his part in hand , and curtailed every speech that admitted being shortened ; besides pointing out the necessity of his being very much dressed , and chusing his colours .
Maria Bertram	“ Do not act anything improper , my dear , ” said Lady Bertram .
Maria Bertram	“ Sir Thomas would not like it.—Fanny , ring the bell ; I must have my dinner.—To be sure , Julia is dressed by this time .
Maria Bertram	“ I am convinced , madam , ” said Edmund , preventing Fanny , “ that Sir Thomas would not like it . ” “ There , my dear , do you hear what Edmund says ? ” “ If I were to decline the part , ” said Maria , with renewed zeal , “ Julia would certainly take it . ” “ What ! ” cried Edmund , “ if she knew your reasons ! ”
Maria Bertram	Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well , though affecting to despise it ; and was too much engaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others , or draw any of those conclusions , or feel any of that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for . Thus much was settled before Edmund , who had been out all the morning , knew anything of the matter ; but when he entered the drawing - room before dinner , the buzz of discussion was high between Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates ; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him the agreeable news .
Maria Bertram	“ But what do you do for women ? ” said Edmund gravely , and looking at Maria .
Maria Bertram	Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered , “ I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done , and ” ( with a bolder eye ) “ Miss Crawford is to be Amelia . ” “ I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up , with _ us _ , ” replied Edmund , turning away to the fire , where sat his mother , aunt , and Fanny , and seating himself with a look of great vexation .
Maria Bertram	In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter ; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates , and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth , Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying , “ I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up .
Maria Bertram	I can not but suppose you _ will _ when you have read it carefully over .
Maria Bertram	Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt , and see how you can approve it .
Maria Bertram	It will not be necessary to send you to your _ father ’s _ judgment , I am convinced . ”
Maria Bertram	“ We see things very differently , ” cried Maria .
Maria Bertram	“ I am perfectly acquainted with the play , I assure you ; and with a very few omissions , and so forth , which will be made , of course , I can see nothing objectionable in it ; and _ I _ am not the _ only _ young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation . ”
Maria Bertram	“ I am sorry for it , ” was his answer ; “ but in this matter it is _ you _ who are to lead .
Maria Bertram	_ You _ must set the example .
Maria Bertram	If others have blundered , it is your place to put them right , and shew them what true delicacy is .
Maria Bertram	In all points of decorum _ your _ conduct must be law to the rest of the party . ” This picture of her consequence had some effect , for no one loved better to lead than Maria ; and with far more good - humour she answered , “ I am much obliged to you , Edmund ; you mean very well , I am sure : but I still think you see things too strongly ; and I really can not undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind .
Maria Bertram	_ There _ would be the greatest indecorum , I think . ”
Maria Bertram	“ Do you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head ?
Maria Bertram	No ; let your conduct be the only harangue .
Maria Bertram	Say that , on examining the part , you feel yourself unequal to it ; that you find it requiring more exertion and confidence than you can be supposed to have .
Maria Bertram	All who can distinguish will understand your motive .
Maria Bertram	The play will be given up , and your delicacy honoured as it ought .
Maria Bertram	“ I am convinced , madam , ” said Edmund , preventing Fanny , “ that Sir Thomas would not like it . ” “ There , my dear , do you hear what Edmund says ? ” “ If I were to decline the part , ” said Maria , with renewed zeal , “ Julia would certainly take it . ” “ What ! ” cried Edmund , “ if she knew your reasons ! ”
Maria Bertram	she might think the difference between us — the difference in our situations — that _ she _ need not be so scrupulous as _ I _ might feel necessary .
Maria Bertram	I am sure she would argue so .
Maria Bertram	No ; you must excuse me ; I can not retract my consent ; it is too far settled , everybody would be so disappointed , Tom would be quite angry ; and if we are so very nice , we shall never act anything . ”
Maria Bertram	I do not know the play ; but , as Maria says , if there is anything a little too warm ( and it is so with most of them ) it can be easily left out .
Maria Bertram	Maria , wanting Henry Crawford ’s animating support , thought the subject better avoided .
Maria Bertram	, found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company ; and Mr. Rushworth , having only his own part and his own dress in his head , had soon talked away all that could be said of either . But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two : there was still a great deal to be settled ; and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage , Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates , soon after their being reassembled in the drawing - room , seated themselves in committee at a separate table , with the play open before them , and were just getting deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford , who , late and dark and dirty as it was , could not help coming , and were received with the most grateful joy . “ Well , how do you go on ? ” and “ What have you settled ? ” and “ Oh ! we can do nothing without you , ” followed the first salutations ; and Henry Crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table , while his sister made her way to Lady Bertram , and with pleasant attention was complimenting _ her _ .
Maria Bertram	“ Do not you think he would ? ” “ _ I _ shall not ask him , ” replied Tom , in a cold , determined manner .
Maria Bertram	Her entreaty had no effect on Tom : he only said again what he had said before ; and it was not merely Tom , for the requisition was now backed by Maria , and Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Yates , with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious , and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny ; and before she could breathe after it , Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you !
Maria Bertram	While he spoke , Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in full expectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as this : so contrary to all their first protestations ; but Edmund said nothing .
Maria Bertram	Tom repeated his resolution of going to him early on the morrow ; and though Julia , who had scarcely opened her lips before , observed , in a sarcastic manner , and with a glance first at Maria and then at Edmund , that “ the Mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly , ” Edmund still held his peace , and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity .
Maria Bertram	Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us , and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father .
Maria Bertram	“ And I longed to do it — but there was such a dead silence !
Maria Bertram	And while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word , or seeming at all interested in the subject , I did not like — I thought it would appear as if I wanted to set myself off at their expense , by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel . ”
Maria Bertram	She certainly understands _ you _ better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long ; and with regard to some others , I can perceive , from occasional lively hints , the unguarded expressions of the moment , that she could define _ many _ as accurately , did not delicacy forbid it .
Maria Bertram	I wonder what she thinks of my father !
Maria Bertram	Could they be much together , I feel sure of their liking each other .
Maria Bertram	I wish they met more frequently !
Maria Bertram	I hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side . ”
Maria Bertram	I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country ; and November is a still more serious month , and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on . ” Fanny could have said a great deal , but it was safer to say nothing , and leave untouched all Miss Crawford ’s resources — her accomplishments , her spirits , her importance , her friends , lest it should betray her into any observations seemingly unhandsome .
Maria Bertram	I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . ” In this quarter , indeed , disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas .
Maria Bertram	He had expected a very different son - in - law ; and beginning to feel grave on Maria ’s account , tried to understand _ her _ feelings .
Maria Bertram	Her behaviour to Mr. Rushworth was careless and cold .
Maria Bertram	She could not , did not like him .
Maria Bertram	resolved to speak seriously to her .
Maria Bertram	Advantageous as would be the alliance , and long standing and public as was the engagement , her happiness must not be sacrificed to it .
Maria Bertram	Mr. Rushworth had , perhaps , been accepted on too short an acquaintance , and , on knowing him better , she was repenting .
Maria Bertram	With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her : told her his fears , inquired into her wishes , entreated her to be open and sincere , and assured her that every inconvenience should be braved , and the connexion entirely given up , if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it .
Maria Bertram	He would act for her and release her .
Maria Bertram	Maria had a moment ’s struggle as she listened , and only a moment ’s : when her father ceased , she was able to give her answer immediately , decidedly , and with no apparent agitation .
Maria Bertram	She thanked him for his great attention , his paternal kindness , but he was quite mistaken in supposing she had the smallest desire of breaking through her engagement , or was sensible of any change of opinion or inclination since her forming it .
Maria Bertram	She had the highest esteem for Mr. Rushworth ’s character and disposition , and could not have a doubt of her happiness with him .
Maria Bertram	Mr. Rushworth must and would improve in good society ; and if Maria could now speak so securely of her happiness with him , speaking certainly without the prejudice , the blindness of love , she ought to be believed .
Maria Bertram	Her feelings , probably , were not acute ; he had never supposed them to be so ; but her comforts might not be less on that account ; and if she could dispense with seeing her husband a leading , shining character
Maria Bertram	, there would certainly be everything else in her favour .
Maria Bertram	Such and such - like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas , happy to escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture , the wonder , the reflections , the reproach that must attend it ; happy to secure a marriage which would bring him such an addition of respectability and influence , and very happy to think anything of his daughter ’s disposition that was most favourable for the purpose .
Maria Bertram	To her the conference closed as satisfactorily as to him .
Maria Bertram	She was in a state of mind to be glad that she had secured her fate beyond recall : that she had pledged herself anew to Sotherton ; that she was safe from the possibility of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her actions , and destroying her prospects ; and retired in proud resolve , determined only to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth in future , that her father might not be again suspecting her .
Maria Bertram	Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four days after Henry Crawford ’s leaving Mansfield , before her feelings were at all tranquillised , before she had given up every hope of him , or absolutely resolved on enduring his rival , her answer might have been different ; but after another three or four days , when there was no return , no letter , no message , no symptom of a softened heart , no hope of advantage from separation , her mind became cool enough to seek all the comfort that pride and self revenge could give .
Maria Bertram	Henry Crawford had destroyed her happiness , but he should not know that he had done it ; he should not destroy her credit , her appearance , her prosperity , too .
Maria Bertram	He should not have to think of her as pining in the retirement of Mansfield for _ him _ , rejecting Sotherton and London , independence and splendour , for _ his _ sake .
Maria Bertram	She was less and less able to endure the restraint which her father imposed .
Maria Bertram	She must escape from him and Mansfield as soon as possible , and find consolation in fortune and consequence , bustle and the world , for a wounded spirit .
Maria Bertram	Her mind was quite determined , and varied not .
Maria Bertram	To such feelings delay , even the delay of much preparation , would have been an evil , and Mr. Rushworth could hardly be more impatient for the marriage than herself .
Maria Bertram	In all the important preparations of the mind she was complete : being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home , restraint , and tranquillity ; by the misery of disappointed affection , and contempt of the man she was to marry .
Maria Bertram	The preparations of new carriages and furniture might wait for London and spring , when her own taste could have fairer play . The principals being all agreed in this respect , it soon appeared that a very few weeks would be sufficient for such arrangements as must precede the wedding .
Maria Bertram	Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire , and make way for the fortunate young woman whom her dear son had selected ; and very early in November removed herself , her maid , her footman , and her chariot , with true dowager propriety , to Bath , there to parade over the wonders of Sotherton in her evening parties ; enjoying them as thoroughly , perhaps , in the animation of a card - table , as she had ever done on the spot ; and before the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which gave Sotherton another mistress .
Maria Bertram	The bride was elegantly dressed ; the two bridesmaids were duly inferior ; her father gave her away ; her mother stood with salts in her hand , expecting to be agitated ; her aunt tried to cry ; and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant .
Maria Bertram	Sir Thomas felt as an anxious father must feel , and was indeed experiencing much of the agitation which his wife had been apprehensive of for herself , but had fortunately escaped .
Maria Bertram	Mrs. Norris , most happy to assist in the duties of the day , by spending it at the Park to support her sister ’s spirits , and drinking the health of Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth in a supernumerary glass or two , was all joyous delight ; for she had made the match ; she had done everything ; and no one would have supposed , from her confident triumph , that she had ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her life , or could have the
Maria Bertram	up under her eye
Maria Bertram	Every public place was new to Maria , and Brighton is almost as gay in winter as in summer .
Maria Bertram	Some other companion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first consequence to his lady ; and Julia was quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as Maria , though she might not have struggled through so much to obtain them , and could better bear a subordinate situation .
Maria Bertram	Her two absent cousins , especially Maria , were much in her thoughts on seeing him ; but no embarrassing remembrance affected _ his _ spirits .
Maria Bertram	Well , I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two - and - forty speeches to her ” ; adding , with a momentary seriousness , “ She is too good for him — much too good . ”
Maria Bertram	Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more gay , and she thought that he was taking particular pains , during dinner , to do away any little resentment of the other two , and restore general good - humour .
Maria Bertram	Miss Bertram had made up her mind to something different , and was a little disappointed ; but her conviction of being really the one preferred comforted her under it , and enabled her to receive Mr.
Maria Bertram	Rushworth ’s parting attentions as she ought
Maria Bertram	He was certainly better pleased to hand her into the barouche than to assist her in ascending the box , and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement .
Maria Bertram	I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go .
Maria Bertram	Maria joined them with the same intent , just then the stoutest of the three ; for the very circumstance which had driven Julia away was to her the sweetest support .
Maria Bertram	Henry Crawford ’s retaining her hand at such a moment , a moment of such peculiar proof and importance , was worth ages of doubt and anxiety .
Maria Bertram	She hailed it as an earnest of the most serious determination , and was equal even to encounter her father .
Maria Bertram	We have just been trying , by way of doing something , and amusing my mother , just within the last week , to get up a few scenes , a mere trifle .
Maria Bertram	“ It is time to think of our visitors , ” said Maria , still feeling her hand pressed to Henry Crawford ’s heart , and caring little for anything else .
Maria Bertram	XVII It was , indeed , a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria .
Maria Bertram	so reasonable as ought to have been their cure ; and now that the conviction of his preference for Maria had been forced on her
Maria Bertram	, she submitted to it without any alarm for Maria ’s situation , or any endeavour at rational tranquillity for herself .
Maria Bertram	“ You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth .
Maria Bertram	It may do _ her _ some good .
Maria Bertram	But , Mary , do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry .
Maria Bertram	I am sure _ Julia _ does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends
Maria Bertram	The sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become her greatest enemy : they were alienated from each other ; and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the attentions which were still carrying on there , some punishment to Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr. Rushworth .
Maria Bertram	Maria felt her triumph , and pursued her purpose , careless of Julia ; and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry Crawford without trusting that it would create jealousy , and bring a public disturbance at last .
Julia Bertram	It was an injury and affront to Julia , who ought to have been Mr. Crawford ’s choice ; and , independently of that , she disliked Fanny , because she had neglected her ; and she would have grudged such an elevation to one whom she had been always trying to depress .
Julia Bertram	Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered , “ I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done , and ” ( with a bolder eye ) “ Miss Crawford is to be Amelia . ” “ I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up , with _ us _ , ” replied Edmund , turning away to the fire , where sat his mother , aunt , and Fanny , and seating himself with a look of great vexation .
Julia Bertram	In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter ; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates , and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth , Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying , “ I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up .
Julia Bertram	Say that , on examining the part , you feel yourself unequal to it ; that you find it requiring more exertion and confidence than you can be supposed to have .
Julia Bertram	“ Sir Thomas would not like it.—Fanny , ring the bell ; I must have my dinner.—To be sure , Julia is dressed by this time .
Julia Bertram	“ I am convinced , madam , ” said Edmund , preventing Fanny , “ that Sir Thomas would not like it . ” “ There , my dear , do you hear what Edmund says ? ” “ If I were to decline the part , ” said Maria , with renewed zeal , “ Julia would certainly take it . ” “ What ! ” cried Edmund , “ if she knew your reasons ! ”
Julia Bertram	she might think the difference between us — the difference in our situations — that _ she _ need not be so scrupulous as _ I _ might feel necessary .
Julia Bertram	I am sure she would argue so .
Julia Bertram	Mr. Yates , who was trying to make himself agreeable to Julia
Julia Bertram	, found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company ; and Mr. Rushworth , having only his own part and his own dress in his head , had soon talked away all that could be said of either . But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two : there was still a great deal to be settled ; and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage , Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates , soon after their being reassembled in the drawing - room , seated themselves in committee at a separate table , with the play open before them , and were just getting deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford , who , late and dark and dirty as it was , could not help coming , and were received with the most grateful joy . “ Well , how do you go on ? ” and “ What have you settled ? ” and “ Oh ! we can do nothing without you , ” followed the first salutations ; and Henry Crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table , while his sister made her way to Lady Bertram , and with pleasant attention was complimenting _ her _ .
Julia Bertram	“ I must really congratulate your ladyship , ” said she , “ on the play being chosen ; for though you have borne it with exemplary patience , I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties .
Julia Bertram	Amelia deserves no better .
Julia Bertram	“ _ I _ should have no objection , ” she replied ; “ for though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported , that is , if everything went well , I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience ; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _ that _ _ table _ ” ( looking round ) , “ it certainly will not be taken . ” Edmund said no more .
Julia Bertram	Yes , Mr. Charles Maddox dined at my sister ’s one day , did not he , Henry ?
Julia Bertram	Tom repeated his resolution of going to him early on the morrow ; and though Julia , who had scarcely opened her lips before , observed , in a sarcastic manner , and with a glance first at Maria and then at Edmund , that “ the Mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly , ” Edmund still held his peace , and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity .
Julia Bertram	Nothing could be objected to when it came under the discussion of the neighbourhood , except that the carriage which conveyed the bride and bridegroom and Julia from the church - door to Sotherton was the same chaise which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelvemonth before .
Julia Bertram	When the novelty of amusement there was over , it would be time for the wider range of London . Julia was to go with them to Brighton .
Julia Bertram	Some other companion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first consequence to his lady ; and Julia was quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as Maria , though she might not have struggled through so much to obtain them , and could better bear a subordinate situation .
Julia Bertram	“ Now , Edmund , do not be disagreeable , ” said Julia .
Julia Bertram	Maria , Julia , Henry Crawford , and Mr. Yates were in the billiard - room .
Julia Bertram	You must see the difference yourself .
Julia Bertram	I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have ; and as to such alterations as I was suggesting just now , such as moving a bookcase , or unlocking a door , or even as using the billiard - room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it , you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room , and less in the breakfast - room , than we did before he went away , or to my sister ’s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other .
Julia Bertram	Julia _ did _ seem inclined to admit that Maria ’s situation might require particular caution and delicacy — but that could not extend to _ her_—she was at liberty ; and Maria evidently considered her engagement as only raising her so much more above restraint , and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult either father or mother .
Julia Bertram	No want of understrappers : my sister desires her love , and hopes to be admitted into the company , and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante , that you may not like to do yourselves .
Julia Bertram	Maria was more to be pitied than Julia ; for to her the father brought a husband , and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness would unite her to the lover , on whom she had chosen that happiness should depend .
Julia Bertram	It was a gloomy prospect , and all she could do was to throw a mist over it , and hope when the mist cleared away she should see something else .
Julia Bertram	“ It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events : your sister ’s marriage , and your taking orders . ” “ Yes . ”
Julia Bertram	My other sacrifice , of course , you do not understand . ”
Julia Bertram	“ My taking orders , I assure you , is quite as voluntary as Maria ’s marrying . ”
Julia Bertram	There is a very good living kept for you , I understand , hereabouts . ”
Julia Bertram	“ Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled , if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without ?
Julia Bertram	No ; for you certainly would not know what to say .
Julia Bertram	But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument .
Julia Bertram	clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish — read the newspaper , watch the weather , and quarrel with his wife . His curate does all the work , and the business of his own life is to dine . ” “ There are such clergymen , no doubt , but I think they are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character .
Julia Bertram	I
Julia Bertram	suspect that in this comprehensive and ( may I say ) commonplace censure , you are not judging from yourself , but from prejudiced persons , whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing .
Julia Bertram	My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it . ”
Julia Bertram	“ I do not wonder at your disapprobation , upon my word .
Julia Bertram	It is a great defect of temper , made worse by a very faulty habit of self - indulgence ; and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours .
Julia Bertram	“ We can not prove to the contrary , to be sure ; but I wish you a better fate , Miss Price , than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons ; for though he may preach himself into a good - humour every Sunday , it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night . ”
Julia Bertram	“ I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny , ” said Edmund affectionately , “ must be beyond the reach of any sermons . ”
Julia Bertram	Fanny turned farther into the window ; and Miss Crawford had only time to say , in a pleasant manner , “ I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it ” ; when , being earnestly invited by the Miss Bertrams to join in a glee , she tripped off to the instrument , leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many virtues , from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread .
Julia Bertram	“ _ You _ taught me to think and feel on the subject , cousin . ” “ I had a very apt scholar .
Julia Bertram	Whatever cross - accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces , she had found a morning of complete enjoyment ; for the housekeeper , after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants , had taken her to the dairy , told her all about their cows , and given her the receipt for a famous cream cheese ; and since Julia ’s leaving them they had been met by the gardener , with whom she had made a most satisfactory acquaintance , for she had set him right as to his grandson ’s illness , convinced him that it was an ague , and promised him a charm for it ; and he , in return , had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants , and actually presented her with a very curious specimen of heath .
Julia Bertram	She felt , as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth , that hers was not the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them : there was gloom on the face of each .
Julia Bertram	At the same moment Mr. Crawford , approaching Julia , said , “ I hope I am not to lose my companion , unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat . ” The request had not been foreseen , but was very graciously received , and Julia ’s day was likely to end almost as well as it began .
Julia Bertram	Maria was just discontented enough to say directly , “ I think _ you _ have done pretty well yourself , ma’am .
Julia Bertram	Your lap seems full of good things , and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully . ”
Julia Bertram	“ My dear , it is only a beautiful little heath , which that nice old gardener would make me take ; but if it is in your way , I will have it in my lap directly .
Julia Bertram	There , Fanny , you shall carry that parcel for me ; take great care of it : do not let it fall ; it is a cream cheese , just like the excellent one we had at dinner .
Julia Bertram	Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs. Whitaker , but my taking one of the cheeses .
Julia Bertram	I stood out as long as I could , till the tears almost came into her eyes , and I knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with .
Julia Bertram	She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table , and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns .
Julia Bertram	Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well .
Julia Bertram	“ What else have you been spunging ? ” said Maria , half - pleased that Sotherton should be so complimented .
Julia Bertram	“ Spunging , my dear !
Julia Bertram	It is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants ’ eggs , which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me : she would not take a denial .
Julia Bertram	She said it must be such an amusement to me , as she understood I lived quite alone , to have a few living creatures of that sort ; and so to be sure it will .
Julia Bertram	I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first spare hen , and if they come to good I can have them moved to my own house and borrow a coop ; and it will be a great delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them .
Julia Bertram	And if I have good luck , your mother shall have some .
Julia Bertram	He felt that he ought not to have allowed the marriage ; that his daughter ’s sentiments had been sufficiently known to him to render him culpable in authorising it ; that in so doing he had sacrificed the right to the expedient , and been governed by motives of selfishness and worldly wisdom .
Julia Bertram	Julia ’s match became a less desperate business than he had considered it at first .
Julia Bertram	She was humble , and wishing to be forgiven ; and Mr. Yates , desirous of being really received into the family , was disposed to look up to him and be guided .
Julia Bertram	Too late he became aware how unfavourable to the character of any young people must be the totally opposite treatment which Maria and Julia had been always experiencing at home , where the excessive indulgence and flattery of their aunt had been continually contrasted with his own severity .
Julia Bertram	That Julia escaped better than Maria was owing , in some measure , to a favourable difference of disposition and circumstance , but in a greater to her having been less the darling of that very aunt , less flattered and less spoilt .
Julia Bertram	Her beauty and acquirements had held but a second place .
Julia Bertram	She had been always used to think herself a little inferior to Maria .
Julia Bertram	Her temper was naturally the easiest of the two ; her feelings , though quick , were more controllable , and education had not given her so very hurtful a degree of self - consequence .
Julia Bertram	She had submitted the best to the disappointment in Henry Crawford .
Julia Bertram	After the first bitterness of the conviction of being slighted was over , she had been tolerably soon in a fair way of not thinking of him again ; and when the acquaintance was renewed in town , and Mr. Rushworth ’s house became Crawford ’s object , she had had the merit of withdrawing herself from it , and of chusing that time to pay a visit to her other friends , in order to secure herself from being again too much attracted .
Julia Bertram	This had been her motive in going to her cousin ’s .
Julia Bertram	Maria ’s guilt had induced Julia ’s folly .
Julia Bertram	But it was possible to part with her , because Susan remained to supply her place .
Julia Bertram	Susan became the stationary niece , delighted to be so ; and equally well adapted for it by a readiness of mind , and an inclination for usefulness , as Fanny had been by sweetness of temper , and strong feelings of gratitude .
Julia Bertram	Susan could never be spared .
Julia Bertram	First as a comfort to Fanny , then as an auxiliary , and last as her substitute , she was established at Mansfield , with every appearance of equal permanency .
Julia Bertram	Her more fearless disposition and happier nerves made everything easy to her there .
Julia Bertram	With quickness in understanding the tempers of those she had to deal with , and no natural timidity to restrain any consequent wishes , she was soon welcome and useful to all ; and after Fanny ’s removal succeeded so naturally to her influence over the hourly comfort of her aunt , as gradually to become , perhaps , the most beloved of the two .
Julia Bertram	Julia ’s looks were an evidence of the fact that made it indisputable ; and after the first starts and exclamations , not a word was spoken for half a minute : each with an altered countenance was looking at some other , and almost each was feeling it a stroke the most unwelcome , most ill - timed , most appalling !
Julia Bertram	Julia was the first to move and speak again .
Julia Bertram	Maria joined them with the same intent , just then the stoutest of the three ; for the very circumstance which had driven Julia away was to her the sweetest support .
Julia Bertram	“ The _ all _ will soon be told , ” cried Tom hastily , and with affected unconcern ; “ but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now .
Julia Bertram	We have just been trying , by way of doing something , and amusing my mother , just within the last week , to get up a few scenes , a mere trifle .
Julia Bertram	“ This was , in fact , the origin of _ our _ acting , ” said Tom , after a moment ’s thought .
Julia Bertram	“ My friend Yates brought the infection from Ecclesford , and it spread — as those things always spread , you know , sir — the faster , probably , from _ your _ having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly .
Julia Bertram	Tom was the only one at all ready with an answer , but he being entirely without particular regard for either , without jealousy either in love or acting , could speak very handsomely of both .
Julia Bertram	Julia was a sufferer too , though not quite so blamelessly .
Julia Bertram	Henry Crawford had trifled with her feelings ; but she had very long allowed and even sought his attentions , with a jealousy of her sister
Julia Bertram	so reasonable as ought to have been their cure ; and now that the conviction of his preference for Maria had been forced on her
Julia Bertram	, she submitted to it without any alarm for Maria ’s situation , or any endeavour at rational tranquillity for herself .
Julia Bertram	She was not pleased to see Julia excluded from the play , and sitting by disregarded ; but as it was not a matter which really involved her happiness , as Henry must be the best judge of his own , and
Julia Bertram	as he did assure her , with a most persuasive smile , that neither he nor Julia had ever had a serious thought of each other , she could only renew her former caution as to the elder sister , entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there , and then gladly take her share in anything that brought cheerfulness to the young people in general , and that did so particularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her . “ I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry , ” was her observation to Mary .
Julia Bertram	“ I dare say she is , ” replied Mary coldly .
Julia Bertram	I am sure _ Julia _ does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends
Julia Bertram	, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . ” “ I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth ’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . ” “ If you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . ”
Julia Bertram	Julia _ did _ suffer , however , though Mrs. Grant discerned it not , and though it escaped the notice of many of her own family likewise .
Julia Bertram	The sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become her greatest enemy : they were alienated from each other ; and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the attentions which were still carrying on there , some punishment to Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr. Rushworth .
Julia Bertram	Maria felt her triumph , and pursued her purpose , careless of Julia ; and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry Crawford without trusting that it would create jealousy , and bring a public disturbance at last .
Julia Bertram	Fanny saw and pitied much of this in Julia ; but there was no outward fellowship between them .
Julia Bertram	Julia made no communication , and Fanny took no liberties .
Julia Bertram	The inattention of the two brothers and the aunt to Julia ’s discomposure , and their blindness to its true cause , must be imputed to the fullness of their own minds .
Julia Bertram	While this was passing , the rest of the party being scattered about the chapel , Julia called Mr. Crawford ’s attention to her sister , by saying , “ Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria , standing side by side , exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed . Have not they completely the air of it ? ”
Julia Bertram	Mr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence , and stepping forward to Maria , said , in a voice which she only could hear , “ I do not like to see Miss Bertram so near the altar .
Julia Bertram	Julia , joining them at the moment , carried on the joke .
Julia Bertram	“ Upon my word , it is really a pity that it should not take place directly , if we had but a proper licence , for here we are altogether , and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant . ”
Julia Bertram	“ If Edmund were but in orders ! ” cried Julia , and running to where he stood with Miss Crawford and Fanny : “ My dear Edmund , if you were but in orders now , you might perform the ceremony directly .
Julia Bertram	How unlucky that you are not ordained ; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready . ”
Julia Bertram	Miss Crawford ’s countenance , as Julia spoke , might have amused a disinterested observer .
Julia Bertram	The remaining three , Mrs. Rushworth , Mrs. Norris , and Julia , were still far behind ; for Julia , whose happy star no longer prevailed , was obliged to keep by the side of Mrs. Rushworth , and restrain her impatient feet to that lady ’s slow pace , while her aunt , having fallen in with the housekeeper , who was come out to feed the pheasants , was lingering behind in gossip with her .
Julia Bertram	Poor Julia , the only one out of the nine not tolerably satisfied with their lot , was now in a state of complete penance , and as different from the Julia of the barouche - box as could well be imagined .
Julia Bertram	This wish was levelled principally at Julia , who had just applied for permission to go to town with Maria ; and as Sir Thomas thought it best for each daughter that the permission should be granted , Lady Bertram , though in her own good - nature she would not have prevented it , was lamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia ’s return , which would otherwise have taken place about this time .
Julia Bertram	Mrs. Norris , however , as most attached to Maria , was really the greatest sufferer .
Julia Bertram	Maria was her first favourite , the dearest of all ; the match had been her own contriving , as she had been wo nt with such pride of heart to feel and say , and this conclusion of it almost overpowered her . She was an altered creature , quieted , stupefied , indifferent to everything that passed .
Julia Bertram	Mr. Rushworth had been gone at this time to Bath , to pass a few days with his mother , and bring her back to town , and Maria was with these friends without any restraint , without even Julia ; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Street two or three weeks before , on a visit to some relations of Sir Thomas ; a removal which her father and mother were now disposed to attribute to some view of convenience on Mr. Yates ’s account . Very soon after the Rushworths ’ return to Wimpole Street , Sir Thomas had received a letter from an old and most particular friend in London , who hearing and witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter , wrote to recommend Sir Thomas ’s coming to London himself , and using his influence with his daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already exposing her to unpleasant remarks , and evidently making Mr. Rushworth uneasy . Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter , without communicating its contents to any creature at Mansfield , when it was followed by another , sent express from the same friend , to break to him the almost desperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people .
Julia Bertram	Tom ’s complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his sister ’s conduct , and his recovery so much thrown back by it , that even Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference , and all her alarms were regularly sent off to her husband ; and Julia ’s elopement , the additional blow which had met him on his arrival in London , though its force had been deadened at the moment , must , she knew , be sorely felt . She saw that it was .
Julia Bertram	Under any circumstances it would have been an unwelcome alliance ; but to have it so clandestinely formed , and such a period chosen for its completion , placed Julia ’s feelings in a most unfavourable light , and severely aggravated the folly of her choice .
Julia Bertram	He called it a bad thing , done in the worst manner , and at the worst time ; and though Julia was yet as more pardonable than Maria as folly than vice , he could not but regard the step she had taken as opening the worst probabilities of a conclusion hereafter like her sister ’s .
Julia Bertram	Such was his opinion of the set into which she had thrown herself .
Mary Crawford	By the time he had given all this information , it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to ; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye , and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London ; that she had sent her best and kindest love , but had had no time for writing ; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour , having spent scarcely twenty - four hours in London , after his return from Norfolk , before he set off again ; that her cousin Edmund was in town , had been in town , he understood , a few days ; that he had not seen him himself , but that he was well , had left them all well at Mansfield , and was to dine , as yesterday , with the Frasers .
Mary Crawford	He must soon give her up , and cease to have the smallest inclination for the match ; and yet , though she had been so much wanting his affection to be cured , this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as the complaint ; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever , agreeable man , than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations .
Mary Crawford	How Miss Crawford really felt , how she meant to act , or might act without or against her meaning ; whether his importance to her were quite what it had been before the last separation ; whether , if lessened , it were likely to lessen more , or to recover itself , were subjects for endless conjecture , and to be thought of on that day and many days to come , without producing any conclusion .
Mary Crawford	The idea that returned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford , after proving herself cooled and staggered by a return to London habits , would yet prove herself in the end too much attached to him to give him up .
Mary Crawford	She would try to be more ambitious than her heart would allow .
Mary Crawford	She would hesitate , she would tease , she would condition , she would require a great deal , but she would finally accept .
Mary Crawford	Yet there was no saying what Miss Crawford might not ask .
Mary Crawford	Fanny was ashamed of her .
Mary Crawford	That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a meeting between him and Mrs. Rushworth , was all in her worst line of conduct , and grossly unkind and ill - judged ; but she hoped _ he _ would not be actuated by any such degrading curiosity .
Mary Crawford	He acknowledged no such inducement , and his sister ought to have given him credit for better feelings than her own .
Mary Crawford	Miss Crawford accepted the part very readily ; and soon after Miss Bertram ’s return from the Parsonage , Mr. Rushworth arrived , and another character was consequently cast .
Mary Crawford	Maria , wanting Henry Crawford ’s animating support , thought the subject better avoided .
Mary Crawford	, found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company ; and Mr. Rushworth , having only his own part and his own dress in his head , had soon talked away all that could be said of either . But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two : there was still a great deal to be settled ; and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage , Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates , soon after their being reassembled in the drawing - room , seated themselves in committee at a separate table , with the play open before them , and were just getting deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford , who , late and dark and dirty as it was , could not help coming , and were received with the most grateful joy . “ Well , how do you go on ? ” and “ What have you settled ? ” and “ Oh ! we can do nothing without you , ” followed the first salutations ; and Henry Crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table , while his sister made her way to Lady Bertram , and with pleasant attention was complimenting _ her _ .

Mary Crawford	The actors may be glad , but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision ; and I do sincerely give you joy , madam , as well as Mrs. Norris , and everybody else who is in the same predicament , ” glancing half fearfully , half slyly , beyond Fanny to
Mary Crawford	The actors may be glad , but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision ; and I do sincerely give you joy , madam , as well as Mrs. Norris , and everybody else who is in the same predicament , ” glancing half fearfully , half slyly , beyond Fanny to
Mary Crawford	She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram , but Edmund said nothing .
Mary Crawford	After continuing in chat with the party round the fire a few minutes , Miss Crawford returned to the party round the table ; and standing by them , seemed to interest herself in their arrangements till , as if struck by a sudden recollection , she exclaimed , “ My good friends , you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses , inside and out ; but pray let me know my fate in the meanwhile .
Mary Crawford	What gentleman among you am I to have the pleasure of making love to ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ You chose very wisely , I am sure , ” replied Miss Crawford , with a brightened look ; “ Anhalt is a heavy part . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I am not at all surprised , ” said Miss Crawford , after a short pause , “ at this want of an Anhalt .
Mary Crawford	Miss Crawford talked of something else , and soon afterwards rejoined the party at the fire .
Mary Crawford	“ They do not want me at all , ” said she , seating herself .
Mary Crawford	“ I only puzzle them , and oblige them to make civil speeches .
Mary Crawford	Mr. Edmund Bertram , as you do not act yourself , you will be a disinterested adviser ; and , therefore , I apply to _ you _ .
Mary Crawford	“ My advice , ” said he calmly , “ is that you change the play . ”
Mary Crawford	“ _ I _ should have no objection , ” she replied ; “ for though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported , that is , if everything went well , I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience ; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _ that _ _ table _ ” ( looking round ) , “ it certainly will not be taken . ” Edmund said no more .
Mary Crawford	“ If _ any _ part could tempt _ you _ to act , I suppose it would be Anhalt , ” observed the lady archly , after a short pause ; “ for he is a clergyman , you know .
Mary Crawford	Miss Crawford was silenced , and with some feelings of resentment and mortification , moved her chair considerably nearer the tea - table , and gave all her attention to Mrs. Norris , who was presiding there .
Mary Crawford	Her entreaty had no effect on Tom : he only said again what he had said before ; and it was not merely Tom , for the requisition was now backed by Maria , and Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Yates , with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious , and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny ; and before she could breathe after it , Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you !
Mary Crawford	Edmund was too angry to speak ; but Miss Crawford , looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris , and then at Fanny , whose tears were beginning to shew themselves , immediately said , with some keenness , “ I do not like my situation : this _ place _ is too hot for me , ” and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table , close to Fanny , saying to her , in a kind , low whisper , as she placed herself , “ Never mind , my dear Miss Price , this is a cross evening : everybody is cross and teasing , but do not let us mind them ” ;
Mary Crawford	and with pointed attention continued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits , in spite of being out of spirits herself .
Mary Crawford	By a look at her brother she prevented any farther entreaty from the theatrical board , and the really good feelings by which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to all the little she had lost in Edmund ’s favour .
Mary Crawford	Fanny did not love Miss Crawford ; but she felt very much obliged to her for her present kindness ;
Mary Crawford	and when , from taking notice of her work , and wishing _ she _ could work as well , and begging for the pattern , and supposing Fanny was now preparing for her _ appearance _ , as of course she would come out when her cousin was married , Miss Crawford proceeded to inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea , and said that she had quite a curiosity to see him , and imagined him a very fine young man , and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea again — she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery , or help listening , and answering with more animation than she had intended .
Mary Crawford	The consultation upon the play still went on , and Miss Crawford ’s attention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram ’s telling her , with infinite regret , that he found it absolutely impossible for him to undertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler : he had been most anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible , but it would not do ; he must give it up .
Mary Crawford	After a moment ’s thought , Miss Crawford calmly replied , “ As far as I am concerned , I can have no objection to anything that you all think eligible .
Mary Crawford	Have I ever seen either of the gentlemen ?
Mary Crawford	Yes , Mr. Charles Maddox dined at my sister ’s one day , did not he , Henry ?
Mary Crawford	I remember him .
Mary Crawford	Let _ him _ be applied to , if you please , for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I am not very sanguine as to our play , ” said Miss Crawford , in an undervoice to Fanny , after some consideration ; “ and I can tell Mr. Maddox that I shall shorten some of _ his _ speeches , and a great many of _ my _ _ own _ , before we rehearse together .
Mary Crawford	It will be very disagreeable , and by no means what I expected . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Miss Crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day : that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect .
Mary Crawford	We were talking of you at the Parsonage , and those were her words .
Mary Crawford	She has great discernment .
Mary Crawford	She certainly understands _ you _ better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long ; and with regard to some others , I can perceive , from occasional lively hints , the unguarded expressions of the moment , that she could define _ many _ as accurately , did not delicacy forbid it .
Mary Crawford	I wonder what she thinks of my father !
Mary Crawford	She must admire him as a fine - looking man , with most gentlemanlike , dignified , consistent manners ; but perhaps , having seen him so seldom , his reserve may be a little repulsive .
Mary Crawford	He would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers .
Mary Crawford	I hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side . ”
Mary Crawford	“ She must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you , ” said Fanny , with half a sigh , “ to have any such apprehension .
Mary Crawford	And Sir Thomas ’s wishing just at first to be only with his family , is so very natural , that she can argue nothing from that .
Mary Crawford	“ This is the first October that she has passed in the country since her infancy .
Mary Crawford	I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country ; and November is a still more serious month , and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on . ” Fanny could have said a great deal , but it was safer to say nothing , and leave untouched all Miss Crawford ’s resources — her accomplishments , her spirits , her importance , her friends , lest it should betray her into any observations seemingly unhandsome .
Mary Crawford	Miss Crawford ’s kind opinion of herself deserved at least a grateful forbearance , and she began to talk of something else .
Mary Crawford	“ To - morrow , I think , my uncle dines at Sotherton , and you and Mr. Bertram too .
Mary Crawford	I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr. Rushworth . ”
Mary Crawford	I should dread the stupidity of the day , if there were not a much greater evil to follow — the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas .
Mary Crawford	I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . ” In this quarter , indeed , disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas .
Mary Crawford	Fanny never dines there , you know , in this sort of way .
Mary Crawford	She used to ask your sisters now and then , but she never asked Fanny .
Mary Crawford	“ She will be late , ” said Sir Thomas , taking out his watch ; “ but what is your difficulty ? ”
Mary Crawford	Here he was again on the same ground where all had passed before , and apparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams , as if he had never known Mansfield in any other state . She heard them spoken of by him only in a general way , till they were all re - assembled in the drawing - room , when Edmund , being engaged apart in some matter of business with Dr. Grant , which seemed entirely to engross them , and Mrs. Grant occupied at the tea - table , he began talking of them with more particularity to his other sister .
Mary Crawford	You must preach at Mansfield , you know , that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you .
Mary Crawford	I can not spare her , and I am sure she does not want to go .
Mary Crawford	“ If you put such a question to her , ” cried Edmund , preventing his cousin ’s speaking , “ Fanny will immediately say No ; but I am sure ,
Mary Crawford	“ I can not imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her ?
Mary Crawford	“ If you can not do without me , ma’am — ” said Fanny , in a self - denying tone .
Mary Crawford	“ But my mother will have my father with her all the evening . ” “ To be sure , so I shall . ” “ Suppose you take my father ’s opinion , ma’am . ” “ That ’s well thought of .
Mary Crawford	So I will , Edmund .
Mary Crawford	I will ask Sir Thomas , as soon as he comes in , whether I can do without her . ”
Mary Crawford	“ As you please , ma’am , on that head ; but I meant my father ’s opinion as to the _ propriety _ of the invitation ’s being accepted or not ; and I think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant , as well as by Fanny , that being the _ first _ invitation it should be accepted . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I do not know .
Mary Crawford	There was nothing more to be said , or that could be said to any purpose , till Sir Thomas were present ; but the subject involving , as it did , her own evening ’s comfort for the morrow , was so much uppermost in Lady Bertram ’s mind , that half an hour afterwards , on his looking in for a minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing - room , she called him back again , when he had almost closed the door , with “ Sir Thomas , stop a moment — I have something to say to you .
Mary Crawford	Her tone of calm languor , for she never took the trouble of raising her voice , was always heard and attended to ; and Sir Thomas came back .
Mary Crawford	Her story began ; and Fanny immediately slipped out of the room ; for to hear herself the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than her nerves could bear .
Mary Crawford	It began , on Lady Bertram ’s part , with—“I have something to tell you
Mary Crawford	Edmund found himself obliged to speak and fill up the blanks in his mother ’s story .
Mary Crawford	Price , to Lady Bertram ’s niece , could never want explanation .
Mary Crawford	” “ Indeed I think you may . ” “ She always makes tea , you know , when my sister is not here . ” “ Your sister , perhaps , may be prevailed on to spend the day with us , and I shall certainly be at home . ”
Mary Crawford	In spite of this conviction , however , she was glad .
Mary Crawford	Simple as such an engagement might appear in other eyes , it had novelty and importance in hers , for excepting the day at Sotherton , she had scarcely ever dined out before ; and though now going only half a mile , and only to three people , still it was dining out , and all the little interests of preparation were enjoyments in themselves .
Mary Crawford	She had neither sympathy nor assistance from those who ought to have entered into her feelings and directed her taste
Mary Crawford	; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to anybody , and Mrs. Norris , when she came on the morrow , in consequence of an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas , was in a very ill humour , and seemed intent only on lessening her niece ’s pleasure , both present and future , as much as possible
Mary Crawford	“ Upon my word , Fanny , you are in high luck to meet with such attention and indulgence !
Mary Crawford	You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking of you , and to your aunt for letting you go , and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary ; for I hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way , or ever dining out at all ; and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated .
Mary Crawford	Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to _ you _ ; the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me .
Mary Crawford	Had the doctor been contented to take my dining - table when I came away , as anybody in their senses would have done , instead of having that absurd new one of his own , which is wider , literally wider than the dinner - table here ,
Mary Crawford	Remember , wherever you are , you must be the lowest and last ; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage
Mary Crawford	, you are not to be taking place of her .
Mary Crawford	Her niece thought it perfectly reasonable .
Mary Crawford	She rated her own claims to comfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could ; and when Sir Thomas soon afterwards , just opening the door , said , “ Fanny , at what time would you have the carriage come round ? ” she felt a degree of astonishment which made it impossible for her to speak .
Mary Crawford	“ My dear Sir Thomas ! ” cried Mrs. Norris , red with anger , “ Fanny can walk . ”
Mary Crawford	No , I see no finery about you ; nothing but what is perfectly proper .
Mary Crawford	I like these glossy spots .
Mary Crawford	Has not Miss Crawford a gown something the same ?
Mary Crawford	And letting down the side - glass to distinguish , “ ’ Tis Crawford ’s , Crawford ’s barouche , I protest !
Mary Crawford	There are his own two men pushing it back into its old quarters .
Mary Crawford	He is here , of course .
Mary Crawford	I shall be very glad to see him .
Mary Crawford	In the drawing - room Mr. Crawford certainly was , having been just long enough arrived to be ready for dinner ; and the smiles and pleased looks of the three others standing round him , shewed how welcome was his sudden resolution of coming to them for a few days on leaving Bath .
Mary Crawford	A very cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund ; and with the exception of Fanny , the pleasure was general ; and even to _ her _ there might be some advantage in his presence , since every addition to the party must rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered to sit silent and unattended to .
Mary Crawford	She was soon aware of this herself ; for though she must submit , as her own propriety of mind directed , in spite of her aunt Norris ’s opinion , to being the principal lady in company , and to all the little distinctions consequent thereon , she found ,
Mary Crawford	while they were at table , such a happy flow of conversation prevailing , in which she was not required to take any part — there was so much to be said between the brother and sister about Bath , so much between the two young men about hunting , so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and Dr. Grant , and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawford and Mrs. Grant , as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to listen in quiet , and of passing a very agreeable day .
Mary Crawford	She could not compliment the newly arrived gentleman , however , with any appearance of interest , in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield , and sending for his hunters from Norfolk , which , suggested by Dr. Grant , advised by Edmund , and warmly urged by the two sisters , was soon in possession of his mind , and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her
Mary Crawford	Her opinion was sought as to the probable continuance of the open weather , but her answers were as short and indifferent as civility allowed .
Mary Crawford	She could not wish him to stay , and would much rather not have him speak to her .
Mary Crawford	Her two absent cousins , especially Maria , were much in her thoughts on seeing him ; but no embarrassing remembrance affected _ his _ spirits .
Mary Crawford	I do not imagine he figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park ; do you , Miss Price ?
Mary Crawford	I think my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her father with Mr. Yates . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Poor Rushworth and his two - and - forty speeches ! ” continued Crawford .
Mary Crawford	I see him now — his toil and his despair .
Mary Crawford	Well , I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two - and - forty speeches to her ” ; adding , with a momentary seriousness , “ She is too good for him — much too good . ”
Mary Crawford	And then changing his tone again to one of gentle gallantry , and addressing Fanny , he said , “ You were Mr. Rushworth ’s best friend .
Mary Crawford	_ He _ might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness , but I may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party . ”
Mary Crawford	“ It is as a dream , a pleasant dream ! ” he exclaimed , breaking forth again , after a few minutes ’ musing .
Mary Crawford	“ I shall always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure .
Mary Crawford	I never was happier .
Mary Crawford	With silent indignation Fanny repeated to herself , “ Never happier!—never happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable!—never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly !
Mary Crawford	“ We were unlucky , Miss Price , ” he continued , in a lower tone , to avoid the possibility of being heard by Edmund , and not at all aware of her feelings , “ we certainly were very unlucky .
Mary Crawford	I think if we had had the disposal of events — if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds just for a week or two , about the equinox , there would have been a difference .
Mary Crawford	I think , Miss Price , we would have indulged ourselves with a week ’s calm in the Atlantic at that season . ” He seemed determined to be answered ; and Fanny , averting her face , said , with a firmer tone than usual , “ As far as _ I _ am concerned , sir , I would not have delayed his return for a day .
Mary Crawford	She had never spoken so much at once to him in her life before , and never so angrily to any one ; and when her speech was over , she trembled and blushed at her own daring .
Mary Crawford	He was surprised ; but after a few moments ’ silent consideration of her , replied in a calmer , graver tone , and as if the candid result of conviction , “ I believe you are right .
Mary Crawford	And then turning the conversation , he would have engaged her on some other subject , but her answers were so shy and reluctant that he could not advance in any .
Mary Crawford	“ The most interesting in the world , ” replied her brother—“how to make money ; how to turn a good income into a better .
Mary Crawford	I
Mary Crawford	I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off .
Mary Crawford	I apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year .
Mary Crawford	Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother ; and as of course he will still live at home , it will be all for his _ menus _ _ plaisirs _ ; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter , I suppose , will be the sum total of sacrifice .
Mary Crawford	” Miss Crawford _ could _ have said that there would be a something to do and to suffer for it , which she could not think lightly of ; but she checked herself and let it pass ; and tried to look calm and unconcerned
Mary Crawford	“ Bertram , ” said Henry Crawford , “ I shall make a point of coming to Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon .
Mary Crawford	I shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner .
Mary Crawford	Miss Price , will not you join me in encouraging your cousin ?
Mary Crawford	” “ I shall keep clear of you , Crawford , as long as I can , ” said Edmund ; “ for you would be more likely to disconcert me , and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man . ”
Mary Crawford	The party being now all united , and the chief talkers attracting each other , she remained in tranquillity ; and as a whist - table was formed after tea — formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant , by his attentive wife , though it was not to be supposed so — and Miss Crawford took her harp , she had nothing to do but to listen ; and
Mary Crawford	her tranquillity remained undisturbed the rest of the evening , except when Mr. Crawford now and then addressed to her a question or observation , which she could not avoid answering .
Mary Crawford	Miss Crawford was too much vexed by what had passed to be in a humour for anything but music .
Mary Crawford	With that she soothed herself and amused her friend .
Mary Crawford	The assurance of Edmund ’s being so soon to take orders , coming upon her like a blow that had been suspended , and still hoped uncertain and at a distance , was felt with resentment and mortification .
Mary Crawford	She was very angry with him .
Mary Crawford	She had thought her influence more .
Mary Crawford	She _ had _ begun to think of him ; she felt that she had , with great regard , with almost decided intentions ; but she would now meet him with his own cool feelings .
Mary Crawford	It was plain that he could have no serious views , no true attachment , by fixing himself in a situation which he must know she would never stoop to .
Mary Crawford	She would learn to match him in his indifference .
Mary Crawford	She would henceforth admit his attentions without any idea beyond immediate amusement .
Mary Crawford	If _ he _ could so command his affections , _ hers _ should do her no harm .
Mary Crawford	Can we be wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same ? ”
Mary Crawford	She followed their steps along the bottom walk , and had just turned up into another , when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford once more caught her ear ; the sound approached , and a few more windings brought them before her .
Mary Crawford	“ I told you I lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew - trees , because I can never bear to ask ; but I have not told you that , with my usual luck — for I never do wrong without gaining by it — I found myself in due time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see .
Mary Crawford	“ My plan may not be the best possible : I had not many minutes to form it in ; but you must do a good deal .
Mary Crawford	The place deserves it , and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of .
Mary Crawford	( Excuse me , your ladyship must not see your cards .
Mary Crawford	There , let them lie just before you . )
Mary Crawford	The place deserves it , Bertram .
Mary Crawford	You talk of giving it the air of a gentleman ’s residence .
Mary Crawford	( Let me see , Mary ; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for that queen ; no , no , a dozen is more than it is worth .
Mary Crawford	By some such improvements as I have suggested ( I do not really require you to proceed upon my plan , though , by the bye , I doubt anybody ’s striking out a better ) you may give it a higher character .
Mary Crawford	All this may be stamped on it ; and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road ; especially as there is no real squire ’s house to dispute the point — a circumstance , between ourselves , to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation . _ You _ think with me , I hope ” ( turning with a softened voice to Fanny ) .
Mary Crawford	“ Have you ever seen the place ? ”
Mary Crawford	His scheme was to rent the house himself the following winter , that he might have a home of his own in that neighbourhood ; and it was not merely for the use of it in the hunting - season ( as he was then telling her ) , though _ that _ consideration had certainly some weight , feeling as he did
Mary Crawford	There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this change in Edmund ; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers , and entered with such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole affair as could have but one effect on him .
Mary Crawford	One advantage resulted from it to Fanny : at the earnest request of Miss Crawford , Mrs. Grant had , with her usual good - humour , agreed to undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted ; and this was all that occurred to gladden _ her _ heart during the day ; and even this , when imparted by Edmund , brought a pang with it , for it was Miss
Mary Crawford	Crawford to whom she was obliged — it was Miss Crawford whose kind exertions were to excite her gratitude , and whose merit in making them was spoken of with a glow of admiration .
Mary Crawford	Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which seemed an insult , with friendly expressions towards herself which she could hardly answer calmly .
Mary Crawford	Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home ; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order .
Mary Crawford	Edmund , between his theatrical and his real part , between Miss Crawford ’s claims and his own conduct , between love and consistency , was equally unobservant ; and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company , superintending their various dresses with economical expedient , for which nobody thanked her , and saving , with delighted integrity , half a crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas , to have leisure for watching the behaviour , or guarding the happiness of his daughters .
Mary Crawford	I thought _ you _ would have entered more into Miss Crawford ’s feelings . ” “ No doubt she will be very glad .
Mary Crawford	It must be a great relief to her , ” said Fanny , trying for greater warmth of manner .
Mary Crawford	“ She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night .
Mary Crawford	It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill . ”
Mary Crawford	“ She _ was _ very kind , indeed , and I am glad to have her spared ” ...
Mary Crawford	it was all Miss Crawford ’s doing .
Mary Crawford	She had seen her influence in every speech , and was miserable .
Mary Crawford	The doubts and alarms as to her own conduct , which had previously distressed her , and which had all slept while she listened to him , were become of little consequence now .
Mary Crawford	Things should take their course ; she cared not how it ended .
Mary Crawford	Her cousins might attack , but could hardly tease her .
Mary Crawford	She was beyond their reach ; and if at last obliged to yield — no matter — it was all misery now .
Mary Crawford	as he did assure her , with a most persuasive smile , that neither he nor Julia had ever had a serious thought of each other , she could only renew her former caution as to the elder sister , entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there , and then gladly take her share in anything that brought cheerfulness to the young people in general , and that did so particularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her . “ I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry , ” was her observation to Mary .
Mary Crawford	“ I dare say she is , ” replied Mary coldly .
Mary Crawford	“ I imagine both sisters are . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home , ” said Mary , after a pause .
Mary Crawford	“ Do you remember Hawkins Browne ’s ‘ Address to Tobacco , ’ in imitation of Pope ? — Blest leaf ! whose aromatic gales dispense To Templars modesty , to Parsons sense . I will parody them — Blest Knight ! whose dictatorial looks dispense To Children affluence , to Rushworth sense .
Mary Crawford	“ You will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family , I assure you .
Mary Crawford	I do not think we do so well without him .
Mary Crawford	But , Mary , do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry .
Mary Crawford	for Edmund was so struck with the circumstance , so delighted with what Miss Crawford had done , so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct between them , that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one pleasure over his own mind , though it might have its drawback .
Mary Crawford	mortifying her severely .
Mary Crawford	Why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ If it had been given to me in the first instance , ” said Fanny , “ I should not have thought of returning it ; but being her brother ’s present , is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it , when it is not wanted ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ She must not suppose it not wanted , not acceptable , at least : and its having been originally her brother ’s gift makes no difference ; for as she was not prevented from offering , nor you from taking it on that account , it ought not to prevent you from keeping it .
Mary Crawford	Miss Crawford ’s attentions to you have been — not more than you were justly entitled to — I am the last person to think that _ could _ _ be _ , but they have been invariable ; and to be returning them with what must have something the _ air _ of ingratitude , though I know it could never have the _ meaning _ , is not in your nature , I am sure .
Mary Crawford	He would marry Miss Crawford .
Mary Crawford	Could she believe Miss Crawford to deserve him , it would be — oh , how different would it be — how far more tolerable !
Mary Crawford	But he was deceived in her : he gave her merits which she had not ; her faults were what they had ever been , but he saw them no longer .
Mary Crawford	To think of him as Miss Crawford might be justified in thinking , would in her be insanity .
Mary Crawford	She would endeavour to be rational , and to deserve the right of judging of Miss Crawford ’s character , and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound intellect and an honest heart . She had all the heroism of principle , and was determined to do her duty ; but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature , let her not be much wondered at , if , after making all these good resolutions on the side of self - government , she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund had begun writing to her , as a treasure beyond all her hopes , and reading with the tenderest emotion these words , “ My very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept ” locked it up with the chain , as the dearest part of the gift .
Mary Crawford	Edmund , she had too much reason to suppose , was at the Parsonage ; and left alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris , who was cross because the housekeeper would have her own way with the supper , and whom _ she _ could not avoid though the housekeeper might , Fanny was worn down at last to think everything an evil belonging to the ball , and when sent off with a parting worry to dress , moved as languidly towards her own room , and felt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no share in it .
Mary Crawford	“ I wished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances , ” was the explanation that followed , and brought Fanny to life again , enabling her , as she found she was expected to speak , to utter something like an inquiry as to the result .
Mary Crawford	“ Yes , ” he answered , “ she is engaged to me ; but ” ( with a smile that did not sit easy ) “ she says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me .
Mary Crawford	She is not serious .
Mary Crawford	I think , I hope , I am sure she is not serious ; but I would rather not hear it .
Mary Crawford	She never has danced with a clergyman , she says , and she never _ will _ .
Mary Crawford	I have been pained by her manner this morning , and can not get the better of it .
Mary Crawford	I know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own , but the influence of her former companions makes her seem — gives to her conversation , to her professed opinions , sometimes a tinge of wrong .
Mary Crawford	She does not _ think _ evil , but she speaks it , speaks it in playfulness ; and though I know it to be playfulness , it grieves me to the soul .
Mary Crawford	“ Dearest Fanny ! ” cried Edmund , pressing her hand to his lips with almost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford ’s , “ you are all considerate thought !
Mary Crawford	I begin to think it most improbable : the chances grow less and less ; and even if it should , there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of , for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples ; and if they are removed , it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had .
Mary Crawford	You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said ; but you have always known my opinion of her ; you can bear me witness , Fanny , that I have never been blinded .
Mary Crawford	How many a time have we talked over her little errors !
Mary Crawford	every serious idea of her ; but I must be a blockhead indeed , if , whatever befell me , I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude . ” He had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen .
Mary Crawford	For Fanny ’s present comfort it was concluded , perhaps , at the happiest moment : had he been able to talk another five minutes , there is no saying that he might not have talked away all Miss Crawford ’s faults and his own despondence .
Mary Crawford	All went well : she did not dislike her own looks ; and when she came to the necklaces again , her good fortune seemed complete , for upon trial the one given her by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the cross .
Mary Crawford	His , therefore , must be worn ; and having , with delightful feelings , joined the chain and the cross — those memorials of the two most beloved of her heart , those dearest tokens so formed for each other by everything real and imaginary — and put them round her neck , and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were , she was able , without an effort , to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford ’s necklace too .
Mary Crawford	Miss Crawford had a claim ; and when it was no longer to encroach on , to interfere with the stronger claims , the truer kindness of another
Mary Crawford	, she could do her justice even with pleasure to herself .
Mary Crawford	Mrs. Chapman had just reached the attic floor , when Miss Price came out of her room completely dressed , and only civilities were necessary ; but Fanny felt her aunt ’s attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman could do themselves .
Mary Crawford	IX Mr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady ; and the whole party were welcomed by him with due attention .
Mary Crawford	In the drawing - room they were met with equal cordiality by the mother , and Miss Bertram had all the distinction with each that she could wish .
Mary Crawford	How would Mr. Crawford like , in what manner would he chuse , to take a survey of the grounds ?
Mary Crawford	Mr. Rushworth mentioned his curricle .
Mary Crawford	Mr. Crawford suggested the greater desirableness of some carriage which might convey more than two .
Mary Crawford	Mrs. Rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also ; but this was scarcely received as an amendment : the young ladies neither smiled nor spoke .
Mary Crawford	Her next proposition , of shewing the house to such of them as had not been there before , was more acceptable , for Miss Bertram was pleased to have its size displayed , and all were glad to be doing something .
Mary Crawford	The whole party rose accordingly , and under Mrs. Rushworth ’s guidance were shewn through a number of rooms , all lofty , and many large , and amply furnished in the taste of fifty years back , with shining floors , solid mahogany , rich damask , marble , gilding , and carving , each handsome in its way .
Mary Crawford	Of pictures there were abundance , and some few good , but the larger part were family portraits , no longer anything to anybody but Mrs. Rushworth , who had been at great pains to learn all that the housekeeper could teach , and was now almost equally well qualified to shew the house . On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to Miss Crawford and Fanny , but there was no comparison in the willingness of their attention ; for Miss Crawford , who had seen scores of great houses , and cared for none of them , had only the appearance of civilly listening , while Fanny , to whom everything was almost as interesting as it was new , attended with unaffected earnestness to all that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in former times , its rise and grandeur , regal visits and loyal efforts , delighted to connect anything with history already known , or warm her imagination with scenes of the past .
Mary Crawford	The situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect from any of the rooms ; and while Fanny and some of the others were attending Mrs. Rushworth , Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking his head at the windows .
Mary Crawford	Having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of any other use than to contribute to the window - tax , and find employment for housemaids , “ Now , ” said Mrs. Rushworth , “ we are coming to the chapel , which properly we ought to enter from above , and look down upon ; but as we are quite among friends , I will take you in this way , if you will excuse me .
Mary Crawford	Mrs. Rushworth began her relation .
Mary Crawford	Before that period , as I understand , the pews were only wainscot ; and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth ; but this is not quite certain .
Mary Crawford	Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain , within the memory of many ; but the late Mr. Rushworth left it off .
Mary Crawford	” “ Every generation has its improvements , ” said Miss Crawford , with a smile , to Edmund .
Mary Crawford	Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford ; and Edmund , Fanny , and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together .
Mary Crawford	“ Very fine indeed , ” said Miss Crawford , laughing .
Mary Crawford	however , I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind .
Mary Crawford	One wishes it were not so ; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are .
Mary Crawford	While this was passing , the rest of the party being scattered about the chapel , Julia called Mr. Crawford ’s attention to her sister , by saying , “ Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria , standing side by side , exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed . Have not they completely the air of it ? ”
Mary Crawford	Mr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence , and stepping forward to Maria , said , in a voice which she only could hear , “ I do not like to see Miss Bertram so near the altar .
Mary Crawford	Starting , the lady instinctively moved a step or two , but recovering herself in a moment , affected to laugh , and asked him , in a tone not much louder , “ If he would give her away ?
Mary Crawford	“ I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly , ” was his reply , with a look of meaning .
Mary Crawford	And she talked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the comprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his mother , and expose her sister to the whispered gallantries of her lover , while Mrs. Rushworth spoke with proper smiles and dignity of its being a most happy event to her whenever it took place .
Mary Crawford	“ If Edmund were but in orders ! ” cried Julia , and running to where he stood with Miss Crawford and Fanny : “ My dear Edmund , if you were but in orders now , you might perform the ceremony directly .
Mary Crawford	How unlucky that you are not ordained ; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready . ”
Mary Crawford	Miss Crawford ’s countenance , as Julia spoke , might have amused a disinterested observer .
Mary Crawford	She looked almost aghast under the new idea she was receiving .
Mary Crawford	Fanny pitied her .
Mary Crawford	“ How distressed she will be at what she said just now
Mary Crawford	, ” passed across her mind .
Mary Crawford	“ Ordained ! ” said Miss Crawford ; “ what , are you to be a clergyman ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Yes ; I shall take orders soon after my father ’s return — probably at Christmas . ”
Mary Crawford	Miss Crawford , rallying her spirits , and recovering her complexion , replied only , “ If I had known this before , I would have spoken of the cloth with more respect , ” and turned the subject .
Mary Crawford	Miss Bertram , displeased with her sister , led the way , and all seemed to feel that they had been there long enough .
Mary Crawford	The lower part of the house had been now entirely shewn , and Mrs. Rushworth , never weary in the cause , would have proceeded towards the principal staircase , and taken them through all the rooms above , if her son had not interposed with a doubt of there being time enough .
Mary Crawford	“ For if , ” said he , with the sort of self - evident proposition which many a clearer head does not always avoid , “ we are _ too _ long going over the house , we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors .
Mary Crawford	Mrs. Rushworth submitted ; and the question of surveying the grounds , with the who and the how , was likely to be more fully agitated , and Mrs. Norris was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and horses most could be done , when the young people , meeting with an outward door , temptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately to turf and shrubs , and all the sweets of pleasure - grounds , as by one impulse , one wish for air and liberty , all walked out .
Mary Crawford	“ Suppose we turn down here for the present , ” said Mrs. Rushworth , civilly taking the hint and following them .
Mary Crawford	“ Query , ” said Mr. Crawford , looking round him , “ whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther ?
Mary Crawford	I see walls of great promise .
Mary Crawford	Mr. Rushworth , shall we summon a council on this lawn ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ James , ” said Mrs. Rushworth to her son , “ I believe the wilderness will be new to all the party .
Mary Crawford	Mr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine the capabilities of that end of the house .
Mary Crawford	Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth ; and when , after a little time , the others began to form into parties , these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund , Miss Crawford , and Fanny , who seemed as naturally to unite , and who , after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties , left them and walked on .
Mary Crawford	The remaining three , Mrs. Rushworth , Mrs. Norris , and Julia , were still far behind ; for Julia , whose happy star no longer prevailed , was obliged to keep by the side of Mrs. Rushworth , and restrain her impatient feet to that lady ’s slow pace , while her aunt , having fallen in with the housekeeper , who was come out to feed the pheasants , was lingering behind in gossip with her .
Mary Crawford	The politeness which she had been brought up to practise as a duty made it impossible for her to escape ; while the want of that higher species of self - command , that just consideration of others , that knowledge of her own heart , that principle of right , which had not formed any essential part of her education , made her miserable under it .
Mary Crawford	“ This is insufferably hot , ” said Miss Crawford , when they had taken one turn on the terrace , and were drawing a second time to the door in the middle which opened to the wilderness .
Mary Crawford	At length , after a short pause , Miss Crawford began with , “ So you are to be a clergyman , Mr. Bertram .
Mary Crawford	This is rather a surprise to me . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Why should it surprise you ?
Mary Crawford	You must suppose me designed for some profession , and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer , nor a soldier , nor a sailor . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Very true ; but , in short , it had not occurred to me .
Mary Crawford	If the man who holds it is so , it is by the neglect of his duty , by foregoing its just importance , and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear . ” “ _ You _ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given , or than I can quite comprehend .
Mary Crawford	How can two sermons a week , even supposing them worth hearing , supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer Blair ’s to his own , do all that you speak of ?
Mary Crawford	“ _ You _ are speaking of London , _ I _ am speaking of the nation at large . ”
Mary Crawford	And with regard to their influencing public manners , Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me , or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of good - breeding , the regulators of refinement and courtesy , the masters of the ceremonies of life .
Mary Crawford	The _ manners _ I speak of might rather be called _ conduct _ , perhaps , the result of good principles ; the effect , in short , of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend ; and it will , I believe , be everywhere found , that as the clergy are , or are not what they ought to be , so are the rest of the nation . ” “ Certainly , ” said Fanny , with gentle earnestness .
Mary Crawford	“ There , ” cried Miss Crawford , “ you have quite convinced Miss Price already . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too . ” “ I do not think you ever will , ” said she , with an arch smile ; “ I am just as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to take orders .
Mary Crawford	“ Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two , but I forestall you ; remember , I have forestalled you . ” “ You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a _ bon _ _ mot _ , for there is not the least wit in my nature .
Mary Crawford	Fanny made the first interruption by saying , “ I wonder that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood ; but the next time we come to a seat , if it is not disagreeable to you , I should be glad to sit down for a little while . ”
Mary Crawford	Perhaps , ” turning to Miss Crawford , “ my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Thank you , but I am not at all tired . ”
Mary Crawford	She took it , however , as she spoke , and the gratification of having her do so , of feeling such a connexion for the first time , made him a little forgetful of Fanny .
Mary Crawford	“ You scarcely touch me , ” said he .
Mary Crawford	“ I am really not tired , which I almost wonder at ; for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood .
Mary Crawford	you do not consider how much we have wound about .
Mary Crawford	I know nothing of your furlongs , but I am sure it is a very long wood , and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it ; and therefore , when I say that we have walked a mile in it , I must speak within compass .
Mary Crawford	After sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again .
Mary Crawford	“ I must move , ” said she ; “ resting fatigues me .
Mary Crawford	I have looked across the ha - ha till I am weary .
Mary Crawford	I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view , without being able to see it so well . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Now , Miss Crawford , if you will look up the walk , you will convince yourself that it can not be half a mile long , or half half a mile . ”
Mary Crawford	“ It is an immense distance , ” said she ; “ I see _ that _ with a glance . ”
Mary Crawford	He still reasoned with her , but in vain .
Mary Crawford	She would not calculate , she would not compare .
Mary Crawford	She would only smile and assert .
Mary Crawford	“ I can not imagine Henry ever to have been happier , ” continued Mary presently , “ than when he had succeeded in getting your brother ’s commission . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I know he must have exerted himself very much , for I know the parties he had to move .
Mary Crawford	I wish we could see him .
Mary Crawford	The recollection of what had been done for William was always the most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr. Crawford ; and she sat thinking deeply of it till Mary , who had been first watching her complacently , and then musing on something else , suddenly called her attention by saying : “ I should like to sit talking with you here all day , but we must not forget the ladies below , and so good - bye , my dear , my amiable , my excellent Fanny , for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast - parlour , I must take leave of you here .
Mary Crawford	And I do take leave , longing for a happy reunion , and trusting that when we meet again , it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve . ” A very , very kind embrace , and some agitation of manner , accompanied these words .
Mary Crawford	Mrs. Norris , however , as most attached to Maria , was really the greatest sufferer .
Mary Crawford	When really touched by affliction , her active powers had been all benumbed ; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom had received from her the smallest support or attempt at support .
Mary Crawford	Edmund was almost as welcome to his brother as Fanny to her aunt ; but Mrs. Norris , instead of having comfort from either , was but the more irritated by the sight of the person whom , in the blindness of her anger , she could have charged as the daemon of the piece .
Mary Crawford	Lady Bertram could not give her much time , or many words , but she felt her , as Fanny ’s sister , to have a claim at Mansfield , and was ready to kiss and like her ; and Susan was more than satisfied , for she came perfectly aware that nothing but ill - humour was to be expected from aunt Norris ; and was so provided with happiness , so strong in that best of blessings , an escape from many certain evils , that she could have stood against a great deal more indifference than she met with from the others . She was now left a good deal to herself , to get acquainted with the house and grounds as she could , and spent her days very happily in so doing , while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut up , or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them , at this time , for everything like comfort ; Edmund trying to bury his own feelings in exertions for the relief of his brother ’s , and Fanny
Mary Crawford	devoted to her aunt Bertram , returning to every former office with more than former zeal , and thinking she could never do enough for one who seemed so much to want her .
Mary Crawford	To talk over the dreadful business with Fanny , talk and lament , was all Lady Bertram ’s consolation .
Mary Crawford	Lady Bertram did not think deeply , but , guided by Sir Thomas , she thought justly on all important points ; and she saw , therefore , in all its enormity , what had happened , and neither endeavoured herself , nor required Fanny to advise her , to think little of guilt and infamy .
Mary Crawford	After a time , Fanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other subjects , and revive some interest in the usual occupations ; but whenever Lady Bertram _ was _ fixed on the event , she could see it only in one light , as comprehending the loss of a daughter , and a disgrace never to be wiped off .
Mary Crawford	Mrs. Rushworth had gone , for the Easter holidays , to Twickenham , with a family whom she had just grown intimate with : a family of lively , agreeable manners , and probably of morals and discretion to suit , for to _ their _ house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times .
Mary Crawford	Mr. Rushworth had been gone at this time to Bath , to pass a few days with his mother , and bring her back to town , and Maria was with these friends without any restraint , without even Julia ; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Street two or three weeks before , on a visit to some relations of Sir Thomas ; a removal which her father and mother were now disposed to attribute to some view of convenience on Mr. Yates ’s account . Very soon after the Rushworths ’ return to Wimpole Street , Sir Thomas had received a letter from an old and most particular friend in London , who hearing and witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter , wrote to recommend Sir Thomas ’s coming to London himself , and using his influence with his daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already exposing her to unpleasant remarks , and evidently making Mr. Rushworth uneasy . Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter , without communicating its contents to any creature at Mansfield , when it was followed by another , sent express from the same friend , to break to him the almost desperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people .
Mary Crawford	Mrs. Rushworth had left her husband ’s house : Mr. Rushworth had been in great anger and distress to _ him _ ( Mr. Harding ) for his advice ; Mr. Harding feared there had been _ at _ _ least _ very flagrant indiscretion .
Mary Crawford	The maidservant of Mrs. Rushworth , senior , threatened alarmingly .
Mary Crawford	He was doing all in his power to quiet everything , with the hope of Mrs. Rushworth ’s return , but was so much counteracted in Wimpole Street by the influence of Mr. Rushworth ’s mother , that the worst consequences might be apprehended .
Mary Crawford	The servant of Mrs. Rushworth , the mother , had exposure in her power , and supported by her mistress , was not to be silenced .
Mary Crawford	The two ladies , even in the short time they had been together , had disagreed ; and the bitterness of the elder against her daughter - in - law
Mary Crawford	But had she been less obstinate , or of less weight with her son , who was always guided by the last speaker , by the person who could get hold of and shut him up , the case would still have been hopeless , for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear again , and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealed somewhere with Mr. Crawford , who had quitted his uncle ’s house , as for a journey , on the very day of her absenting herself .
Mary Crawford	Sir Thomas , however , remained yet a little longer in town , in the hope of discovering and snatching her from farther vice , though all was lost on the side of character . _ His _ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of .
Mary Crawford	Tom ’s complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his sister ’s conduct , and his recovery so much thrown back by it , that even Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference , and all her alarms were regularly sent off to her husband ; and Julia ’s elopement , the additional blow which had met him on his arrival in London , though its force had been deadened at the moment , must , she knew , be sorely felt . She saw that it was .
Mary Crawford	His displeasure against herself she trusted , reasoning differently from Mrs. Norris , would now be done away .
Mary Crawford	It was of a much less poignant nature than what the others excited ; but Sir Thomas was considering his happiness as very deeply involved in the offence of his sister and friend ; cut off by it , as he must be , from the woman whom he had been pursuing with undoubted attachment and strong probability of success ; and who , in everything but this despicable brother , would have been so eligible a connexion
Mary Crawford	He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf , in addition to all the rest , when they were in town : he had seen or conjectured his feelings ; and , having reason to think that one interview with Miss Crawford had taken place , from which Edmund derived only increased distress , had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him out of town , and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt , with a view to his relief and benefit , no less than theirs .
Mary Crawford	Fanny was not in the secret of her uncle ’s feelings , Sir Thomas not in the secret of Miss Crawford ’s character . Had he been privy to her conversation with his son , he would not have wished her to belong to him , though her twenty thousand pounds had been forty .
Mary Crawford	That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit of a doubt with Fanny ; and yet , till she knew that he felt the same , her own conviction was insufficient .
Mary Crawford	Long , long would it be ere Miss Crawford ’s name passed his lips again , or she could hope for a renewal of such confidential intercourse as had been .
Mary Crawford	He had seen Miss Crawford .
Mary Crawford	He had been invited to see her .
Mary Crawford	He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call ; and regarding it as what was meant to be the last , last interview of friendship , and investing her with all the feelings of shame and wretchedness which Crawford ’s sister ought to have known , he had gone to her in such a state of mind , so softened , so devoted , as made it for a few moments impossible to Fanny ’s fears that it should be the last .
Mary Crawford	With a graver look and voice she then added , ‘ I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister ’s expense . ’
Mary Crawford	He would have taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again .
Mary Crawford	That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister ( with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say ) , but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself ,
Mary Crawford	giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past .
Mary Crawford	And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem .
Mary Crawford	Equally in brother and sister deceived !
Mary Crawford	Till that happened , they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone , and how she had attached him , and how delightful nature had made her , and how excellent she would have been , had she fallen into good hands earlier .
Mary Crawford	The young people were pleased with each other from the first .
Mary Crawford	Miss Crawford ’s beauty did her no disservice with the Miss Bertrams .
Mary Crawford	They were too handsome themselves to dislike any woman for being so too , and were almost as much charmed as their brothers with her lively dark eye , clear brown complexion , and general prettiness .
Mary Crawford	Had she been tall , full formed , and fair , it might have been more of a trial : but as it was , there could be no comparison ; and she was most allowably a sweet , pretty girl , while they were the finest young women in the country .
Mary Crawford	Her brother was not handsome : no , when they first saw him he was absolutely plain , black and plain ; but still he was the gentleman , with a pleasing address .
Mary Crawford	He was , in fact , the most agreeable young man the sisters had ever known , and they were equally delighted with him .
Mary Crawford	the Miss Bertrams were worth pleasing , and were ready to be pleased ; and he began with no object but of making them like him .
Mary Crawford	, he allowed himself great latitude on such points . “ I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly , sister , ” said he , as he returned from attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit ; “ they are very elegant , agreeable girls . ”
Mary Crawford	“ But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him ; _ that _ is your opinion of your intimate friend .
Mary Crawford	“ Mary , how shall we manage him ? ” “ We must leave him to himself , I believe .
Mary Crawford	“ Not always in marriage , dear Mary . ”
Mary Crawford	“ My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state ; but , however , speaking from my own observation , it is a manoeuvring business .
Mary Crawford	I beg your pardon , but I can not quite believe you .
Mary Crawford	Depend upon it , you see but half .
Mary Crawford	You see the evil , but you do not see the consolation .
Mary Crawford	“ You are as bad as your brother , Mary ; but we will cure you both .
Mary Crawford	The Crawfords , without wanting to be cured , were very willing to stay .
Mary Crawford	Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home , and Henry equally ready to lengthen his visit .
Mary Crawford	The Miss Bertrams ’ admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than anything which Miss Crawford ’s habits made her likely to feel .
Mary Crawford	acknowledged , however , that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men , that two such young men were not often seen together even in London , and that their manners , particularly those of the eldest , were very good . _ He _ had been much in London , and had more liveliness and gallantry than Edmund , and must , therefore , be preferred ; and , indeed , his being the eldest was another strong claim .
Mary Crawford	and what was _ her _ opinion of the newcomers ? Few young ladies of eighteen could be less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny . In a quiet way , very little attended to , she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss Crawford ’s beauty ; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford very plain , in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the contrary , she never mentioned _ him _ .
Mary Crawford	“ I begin now to understand you all , except Miss Price
Mary Crawford	, ” said Miss Crawford , as she was walking with the Mr. Bertrams .
Mary Crawford	“ Pray , is she out , or is she not ?
Mary Crawford	I am puzzled .
Mary Crawford	She dined at the Parsonage , with the rest of you , which seemed like being _ out _ ; and yet she says so little , that I can hardly suppose she _ is _ . ”
Mary Crawford	She has the age and sense of a woman , but the outs and not outs are beyond me .
Mary Crawford	assure you ; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far , it is all very proper .
Mary Crawford	I felt that I must be the jest of the room at the time , and Miss Crawford , it is plain , has heard the story .
Mary Crawford	“ I do not know , ” replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly .
Mary Crawford	“ Yes , I can not
Mary Crawford	It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were , which I have seen done .
Mary Crawford	They looked just the same : both well - dressed , with veils and parasols like other girls ; but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the youngest , who was not _ out _ , and had most excessively offended the eldest .
Mary Crawford	Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months ; and Miss Sneyd , I believe , has never forgiven me .
Mary Crawford	Poor Miss Sneyd .
Mary Crawford	Though I have no younger sister , I feel for her .
Mary Crawford	Miss Augusta should have been with her governess .
Mary Crawford	But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price .
Mary Crawford	Does she go to balls ?
Mary Crawford	Does she dine out every where , as well as at my sister ’s ? ” “ No , ” replied Edmund ; “ I do not think she has ever been to a ball .
Mary Crawford	Miss Price is not out . ”
Mary Crawford	Poor Mary little thought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep , only two hours before she died .
Mary Crawford	Poor little soul !
Mary Crawford	she could but just speak to be heard , and she said so prettily , ‘ Let sister Susan have my knife , mama , when I am dead and buried .
Mary Crawford	she was so fond of it , Fanny , that she would have it lay by her in bed , all through her illness .
Mary Crawford	It was the gift of her good godmother , old Mrs. Admiral Maxwell , only six weeks before she was taken for death .
Mary Crawford	Well , she was taken away from evil to come .
Mary Crawford	My own Betsey ” ( fondling her ) , “ _ you _ have not the luck of such a good godmother .
Mary Crawford	Fanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris , but a message to say she hoped that her god - daughter was a good girl , and learnt her book .
Mary Crawford	While her hand was trembling under these letters , her eye running from one to the other , and her heart swelling with emotion , Crawford thus continued , with unfeigned eagerness , to express his interest in the event — “ I will not talk of my own happiness , ” said he , “ great as it is , for I think only of yours .
Mary Crawford	Compared with you , who has a right to be happy ?
Mary Crawford	He had communicated it to no creature : he had not breathed a syllable of it even to Mary ; while uncertain of the issue
Mary Crawford	He had a note to deliver from his sister .
Mary Crawford	“ MY DEAR FANNY,—for so I may now always call you , to the infinite relief of a tongue that has been stumbling at _ Miss _ _ Price _ for at least the last six weeks — I can not let my brother go without sending you a few lines of general congratulation , and giving my most joyful consent and approval .
Mary Crawford	“ Very true , sister , as you say .
Mary Crawford	they can not help it ; and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas .
Mary Crawford	At last — it seemed an at last to Fanny ’s nervousness , though not remarkably late — he began to talk of going away ; but the comfort of the sound was impaired by his turning to her the next moment , and saying , “ Have you nothing to send to Mary ?
Mary Crawford	No answer to her note ?
Mary Crawford	She will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you .
Mary Crawford	Pray write to her , if it be only a line .
Mary Crawford	Quite unpractised in such sort of note - writing , had there been time for scruples and fears as to style she would have felt them in abundance : but something must be instantly written ; and with only one decided feeling , that of wishing not to appear to think anything really intended , she wrote thus , in great trembling both of spirits and hand — “ I am very much obliged to you , my dear Miss Crawford , for your kind congratulations , as far as they relate to my dearest William .
Mary Crawford	The rest of your note I know means nothing ; but I am so unequal to anything of the sort , that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice .
Mary Crawford	I do not know what I write , but it would be a great favour of you never to mention the subject again .
Mary Crawford	With thanks for the honour of your note , I remain , dear Miss Crawford , & c. , & c. ”
Mary Crawford	” These were not expressions to do Fanny any good ; for though she read in too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss Crawford ’s meaning , it was evident that she meant to compliment her on her brother ’s attachment , and even to _ appear _ to believe it serious .
Mary Crawford	She had read Miss Crawford ’s note only once , and how to reply to anything so imperfectly understood was most distressing .
Mrs. Rushworth	By the time he had given all this information , it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to ; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye , and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London ; that she had sent her best and kindest love , but had had no time for writing ; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour , having spent scarcely twenty - four hours in London , after his return from Norfolk , before he set off again ; that her cousin Edmund was in town , had been in town , he understood , a few days ; that he had not seen him himself , but that he was well , had left them all well at Mansfield , and was to dine , as yesterday , with the Frasers .
Mrs. Rushworth	Fanny was doubly silenced here ; though when the moment was passed , could regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged comprehension of one half of his meaning , and encouraged him to say something more of his sister and Edmund .
Mrs. Rushworth	The two ladies were together in the breakfast - room , and , fortunately for him , Lady Bertram was on the very point of quitting it as he entered .
Mrs. Rushworth	She was almost at the door , and not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain , she still went on , after a civil reception , a short sentence about being waited for , and a “ Let Sir Thomas know ” to the servant .
Mrs. Rushworth	She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever , and began to be in despair of ever getting away ; but at last they were in the drawing - room , and she was able to think as she would , while her aunts finished the subject of William ’s appointment in their own style .
Mrs. Rushworth	” “ I am glad you gave him something considerable , ” said Lady Bertram , with most unsuspicious calmness , “ for _ I _ gave him only £ 10 . ”
Susan Price	One morning , about this time , Fanny having now been nearly four weeks from Mansfield , a point which she never failed to think over and calculate every day , as she and Susan were preparing to remove , as usual , upstairs , they were stopped by the knock of a visitor , whom they felt they could not avoid , from Rebecca ’s alertness in going to the door , a duty which always interested her beyond any other .
Susan Price	And the consequence was , that Fanny , strange as it was — strange , awkward , and distressing — found herself and Susan , within ten minutes , walking towards the High Street with Mr. Crawford .
Susan Price	Crawford could not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down ; but he could have wished her sister away .
Susan Price	A quick - looking girl of Susan ’s age
Susan Price	was the very worst third in the world : totally different from Lady Bertram , all eyes and ears ; and there was no introducing the main point before her .
Susan Price	He must content himself with being only generally agreeable , and letting Susan have her share of entertainment , with the indulgence , now and then , of a look or hint for the better - informed and conscious Fanny .
Susan Price	Such a man could come from no place , no society , without importing something to amuse ; his journeys and his acquaintance were all of use , and Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her .
Susan Price	, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute ’s privacy for telling Fanny that his only business in Portsmouth was to see her ; that he was come down for a couple of days on her account , and hers only , and because he could not endure a longer total separation . She was sorry , really sorry ; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said , she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him ; he was much more gentle , obliging , and attentive to other people ’s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield ; she had never seen him so agreeable — so _ near _ being agreeable ; his behaviour to her father could not offend , and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of Susan . He was decidedly improved .
Susan Price	Rebecca ’s cookery and Rebecca ’s waiting , and Betsey ’s eating at table without restraint , and pulling everything about as she chose , were what Fanny herself was not yet enough inured to for her often to make a tolerable meal .
Susan Price	XLIII It was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back , to London , on the morrow , for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price ’s ; and two days afterwards , it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letter from his sister , opened and read by her , on another account , with the most anxious curiosity :
Susan Price	— “ I have to inform you , my dearest Fanny , that Henry has been down to Portsmouth to see you ; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday , and one still more to be dwelt on the next day , on the ramparts ; when the balmy air , the sparkling sea , and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony , and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect .
Susan Price	This , as well as I understand , is to be the substance of my information .
Susan Price	He acknowledged no such inducement , and his sister ought to have given him credit for better feelings than her own .
Susan Price	She was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receiving this than she had been before ; and for a few days was so unsettled by it altogether , by what had come , and what might come , that her usual readings and conversation with Susan were much suspended . She could not
Susan Price	Time did something , her own exertions something more , and she resumed her attentions to Susan , and again awakened the same interest in them .
Susan Price	Susan was growing very fond of her , and though without any of the early delight in books which had been so strong in Fanny , with a disposition much less inclined to sedentary pursuits , or to information for information ’s sake , she had so strong a desire of not _ appearing _ ignorant , as , with a good clear understanding , made her a most attentive , profitable , thankful pupil .
Susan Price	Fanny was her oracle .
Susan Price	What Fanny told her of former times dwelt more on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith ; and she paid her sister the compliment of preferring her style to that of any printed author .
Susan Price	Susan , who had an innate taste for the genteel and well - appointed , was eager to hear , and Fanny could not but indulge herself in dwelling on so beloved a theme .
Susan Price	She hoped it was not wrong ; though , after a time , Susan ’s very great admiration of everything said or done in her uncle ’s house , and earnest longing to go into Northamptonshire , seemed almost to blame her for exciting feelings which could not be gratified . Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her elder sister ; and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this , she began to feel that when her own release from Portsmouth came , her happiness would have a material drawback in leaving Susan behind .
Susan Price	“ Have you no message for anybody ? ” “ My love to your sister , if you please ; and when you see my cousin , my cousin Edmund , I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him . ” “ Certainly ; and if he is lazy or negligent , I will write his excuses myself . ” He could say no more , for Fanny would be no longer detained .
Susan Price	After being nursed up at Mansfield , it was too late in the day to be hardened at Portsmouth ; and though Sir Thomas , had he known all , might have thought his niece in the most promising way of being starved , both mind and body , into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford ’s good company and good fortune , he would probably have feared to push his experiment farther , lest she might die under the cure . Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day .
Susan Price	She hoped it was not wrong ; though , after a time , Susan ’s very great admiration of everything said or done in her uncle ’s house , and earnest longing to go into Northamptonshire , seemed almost to blame her for exciting feelings which could not be gratified . Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her elder sister ; and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this , she began to feel that when her own release from Portsmouth came , her happiness would have a material drawback in leaving Susan behind .
Susan Price	Susan too was a grievance .
Susan Price	She had not spirits to notice her in more than a few repulsive looks , but she felt her as a spy , and an intruder , and an indigent niece , and everything most odious .
Susan Price	By her other aunt , Susan was received with quiet kindness .
Susan Price	Lady Bertram could not give her much time , or many words , but she felt her , as Fanny ’s sister , to have a claim at Mansfield , and was ready to kiss and like her ; and Susan was more than satisfied , for she came perfectly aware that nothing but ill - humour was to be expected from aunt Norris ; and was so provided with happiness , so strong in that best of blessings , an escape from many certain evils , that she could have stood against a great deal more indifference than she met with from the others . She was now left a good deal to herself , to get acquainted with the house and grounds as she could , and spent her days very happily in so doing , while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut up , or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them , at this time , for everything like comfort ; Edmund trying to bury his own feelings in exertions for the relief of his brother ’s , and Fanny
Mrs. Price	Good sense , like hers , will always act when really called upon ; and she found that she had been able to name him to her mother , and recall her remembrance of the name , as that of “ William ’s friend , ” though she could not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable at such a moment .
Mrs. Price	While trying to keep herself alive , their visitor , who had at first approached her with as animated a countenance as ever , was wisely and kindly keeping his eyes away , and giving her time to recover , while he devoted himself entirely to her mother , addressing her , and attending to her with the utmost politeness and propriety , at the same time with a degree of friendliness , of interest at least , which was making his manner perfect . Mrs. Price ’s manners were also at their best .
Mrs. Price	“ It was a lovely morning , and at that season of the year a fine morning so often turned off , that it was wisest for everybody not to delay their exercise ” ; and such hints producing nothing , he soon proceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price and her daughters to take their walk without loss of time .
Mrs. Price	Mrs. Price , it appeared , scarcely ever stirred out of doors , except of a Sunday ; she owned she could seldom , with her large family , find time for a walk .
Mrs. Price	“ Would she not , then , persuade her daughters to take advantage of such weather , and allow him the pleasure of attending them ? ”
Mrs. Price	Mrs. Price was greatly obliged and very complying .
Mrs. Price	“ Her daughters were very much confined ; Portsmouth was a sad place ; they did not often get out ; and she knew they had some errands in the town , which they would be very glad to do .
Mrs. Price	XXXIX Could Sir Thomas have seen all his niece ’s feelings , when she wrote her first letter to her aunt , he would not have despaired ; for though a good night ’s rest , a pleasant morning , the hope of soon seeing William again , and the comparatively quiet state of the house , from Tom and Charles being gone to school , Sam on some project of his own , and her father on his usual lounges , enabled her to express herself cheerfully on the subject of home , there were still , to her own perfect consciousness , many drawbacks suppressed .
Mrs. Price	Could he have seen only half that she felt before the end of a week , he would have thought Mr. Crawford sure of her , and been delighted with his own sagacity . Before the week ended , it was all disappointment .
Mrs. Price	The Thrush had had her orders , the wind had changed , and he was sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth ; and during those days she had seen him only twice , in a short and hurried way , when he had come ashore on duty .
Mrs. Price	Everything in that quarter failed her , except William ’s affection .
Mrs. Price	His last thought on leaving home was for her .
Mrs. Price	He stepped back again to the door to say , “ Take care of Fanny , mother .
Mrs. Price	I charge you , take care of Fanny . ”
Mrs. Price	On her father , her confidence had not been sanguine , but he was more negligent of his family , his habits were worse , and his manners coarser , than she had been prepared for .
Mrs. Price	He did not want abilities but he had no curiosity , and no information beyond his profession ; he read only the newspaper and the navy - list ; he talked only of the dockyard , the harbour , Spithead , and the Motherbank ; he swore and he drank , he was dirty and gross .
Mrs. Price	She had never been able to recall anything approaching to tenderness in his former treatment of herself .
Mrs. Price	There had remained only a general impression of roughness and loudness ; and now he scarcely ever noticed her , but to make her the object of a coarse joke .
Mrs. Price	Her disappointment in her mother was greater : _ there _ she had hoped much , and found almost nothing .
Mrs. Price	Mrs. Price was not unkind ; but , instead of gaining on her affection and confidence , and becoming more and more dear , her daughter never met with greater kindness from her than on the first day of her arrival .
Mrs. Price	The instinct of nature was soon satisfied , and Mrs. Price ’s attachment had no other source .
Mrs. Price	Her heart and her time were already quite full ; she had neither leisure nor affection to bestow on Fanny .
Mrs. Price	Her daughters never had been much to her .
Mrs. Price	She was fond of her sons , especially of William , but Betsey was the
Mrs. Price	of her girls whom she had ever much regarded
Mrs. Price	To her she was most injudiciously indulgent .
Mrs. Price	William was her pride ; Betsey her darling ; and
Mrs. Price	John , Richard , Sam , Tom , and Charles occupied all the rest of her maternal solicitude , alternately her worries and her comforts .
Mrs. Price	These shared her heart : her time was given chiefly to her house and her servants .
Mrs. Price	Her days were spent in a kind of slow bustle ; all was busy without getting on , always behindhand and lamenting it , without altering her ways ; wishing to be an economist , without contrivance or regularity ; dissatisfied with her servants , without skill to make them better , and whether helping , or reprimanding , or indulging them , without any power of engaging their respect .
Mrs. Price	Of her two sisters , Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram than Mrs. Norris .
Mrs. Price	She might scruple to make use of the words , but she must and did feel that her mother was a partial , ill - judging parent , a dawdle , a slattern , who neither taught nor restrained her children , whose house was the scene of mismanagement and discomfort from beginning to end , and who had no talent , no conversation , no affection towards herself ; no curiosity to know her better , no desire of her friendship , and no inclination for her company that could lessen her sense of such feelings .
Mrs. Price	Her continual disagreements with her mother , her rash squabbles with Tom and Charles , and petulance with Betsey , were at least so distressing to Fanny that , though admitting they were by no means without provocation , she feared the disposition that could push them to such length must be far from amiable , and from affording any repose to herself .
Mrs. Price	Such was the home which was to put Mansfield out of her head , and teach her to think of her cousin Edmund with moderated feelings .
Mrs. Price	On the contrary , she could think of nothing but Mansfield , its beloved inmates , its happy ways .
Mrs. Price	Everything where she now was in full contrast
Mrs. Price	The elegance , propriety , regularity , harmony , and perhaps , above all , the peace and tranquillity of Mansfield , were brought to her remembrance every hour of the day , by the prevalence of everything opposite to them _ here _ .
Mrs. Price	everybody was noisy , every voice was loud ( excepting , perhaps , her mother ’s , which resembled the soft monotony of Lady Bertram ’s , only worn into fretfulness ) .
Mrs. Price	I am sure I told her to bring some coals half an hour ago .
Mrs. Price	” “ I was upstairs , mama , moving my things , ” said Susan , in a fearless , self - defending tone , which startled Fanny .
Mrs. Price	Farther discussion was prevented by various bustles : first , the driver came to be paid ; then there was a squabble between Sam and Rebecca about the manner of carrying up his sister ’s trunk , which he would manage all his own way ; and lastly , in walked Mr. Price himself , his own loud voice preceding him , as with something of the oath kind he kicked away his son ’s portmanteau and his daughter ’s bandbox in the passage , and called out for a candle ; no candle was brought , however , and he walked into the room .
Mrs. Price	Fanny with doubting feelings had risen to meet him , but sank down again on finding herself undistinguished in the dusk , and unthought of .
Mrs. Price	With a friendly shake of his son ’s hand , and an eager voice , he instantly began—“Ha !
Mrs. Price	welcome back , my boy .
Mrs. Price	I have been to Turner ’s about your mess ; it is all in a way to be done .
Mrs. Price	I should not wonder if you had your orders to - morrow : but you can not sail with this wind ,
Mrs. Price	By G — , I wish you may !
Mrs. Price	With an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her , Mr. Price now received his daughter ; and having given her a cordial hug , and observed that she was grown into a woman , and he supposed would be wanting a husband soon , seemed very much inclined to forget her again .
Mrs. Price	Fanny shrunk back to her seat , with feelings sadly pained by his language and his smell of spirits ; and he talked on only to his son , and only of the Thrush , though William , warmly interested as he was in that subject , more than once tried to make his father think of Fanny , and her long absence and long journey . After sitting some time longer , a candle was obtained ; but as there was still no appearance of tea , nor , from Betsey ’s reports from the kitchen , much hope of any under a considerable period , William determined to go and change his dress , and make the necessary preparations for his removal on board directly , that he might have his tea in comfort afterwards .
Mrs. Price	Charles had been born since Fanny ’s going away , but Tom she had often helped to nurse , and now felt a particular pleasure in seeing again .
Mrs. Price	but Tom she wanted to keep by her , to try to trace the features of the baby she had loved , and talked to , of his infant preference of herself . Tom , however , had no mind for such treatment : he came home not to stand and be talked to , but to run about and make a noise ; and both boys had soon burst from her , and slammed the parlour - door till her temples ached .
Mrs. Price	She had now seen all that were at home ; there remained only two brothers between herself and Susan , one of whom was a clerk in a public office in London , and the other midshipman on board an Indiaman .
Mrs. Price	But though she had _ seen _ all the members of the family , she had not yet _ heard _ all the noise they could make .
Mrs. Price	brought her a great deal more .
Mrs. Price	William was soon calling out from the landing - place of the second story for his mother and for Rebecca .
Mrs. Price	Mrs. Price , Rebecca , and Betsey all went up to defend themselves , all talking together , but Rebecca loudest , and the job was to be done as well as it could in a great hurry ; William trying in vain to send Betsey down again , or keep her from being troublesome where she was ; the whole of which , as almost every door in the house was open , could be plainly distinguished in the parlour , except when drowned at intervals by the superior noise of Sam , Tom , and Charles chasing each other up and down stairs , and tumbling about and hallooing . Fanny was almost stunned .
Mrs. Price	_ Within _ the room all was tranquil enough , for Susan having disappeared with the others , there were soon only her father and herself remaining ; and he , taking out a newspaper , the accustomary loan of a neighbour , applied himself to studying it , without seeming to recollect her existence .
Mrs. Price	The solitary candle was held between himself and the paper , without any reference to her possible convenience ; but she had nothing to do , and was glad to have the light screened from her aching head , as she sat in bewildered , broken , sorrowful contemplation .
Mrs. Price	What right had she to be of importance to her family ?
Mrs. Price	She could have none , so long lost sight of !
Mrs. Price	Yet to have so little said or asked about herself , to have scarcely an inquiry made after Mansfield !
Mrs. Price	her to have Mansfield forgotten ; the friends who had done so much — the
Mrs. Price	_ She _ only was to blame .
Mrs. Price	Yet she thought it would not have been so at Mansfield .
Mrs. Price	No , in her uncle ’s house there would have been a consideration of times and seasons , a regulation of subject , a propriety , an attention towards everybody which there was not here .
Mrs. Price	The only interruption which thoughts like these received for nearly half an hour was from a sudden burst of her father ’s , not at all calculated to compose them .
Mrs. Price	At a more than ordinary pitch of thumping and hallooing in the passage , he exclaimed , “ Devil take those young dogs !
Mrs. Price	Sam , stop your confounded pipe , or I shall be after you . ”
Mrs. Price	This threat was so palpably disregarded , that though within five minutes afterwards the three boys all burst into the room together and sat down , Fanny could not consider it as a proof of anything more than their being for the time thoroughly fagged , which their hot faces and panting breaths seemed to prove , especially as they were still kicking each other ’s shins , and hallooing out at sudden starts immediately under their father ’s eye .
Mrs. Price	Susan and an attendant girl , whose inferior appearance informed Fanny , to her great surprise , that she had previously seen the upper servant , brought in everything necessary for the meal ; Susan looking , as she put the kettle on the fire and glanced at her sister , as if divided between the agreeable triumph of shewing her activity and usefulness , and the dread of being thought to demean herself by such an office . “ She had been into the kitchen , ” she said , “ to hurry Sally and help make the toast , and spread the bread and butter , or she did not know when they should have got tea , and she was sure her sister must want something after her journey .
Mrs. Price	In this more placid state of things William reentered , followed not far behind by his mother and Betsey .
Mrs. Price	The next bustle brought in Mr. Campbell , the surgeon of the Thrush , a very well - behaved young man , who came to call for his friend , and for whom there was with some contrivance found a chair , and with some hasty washing of the young tea - maker ’s , a cup and saucer ; and after another quarter of an hour of earnest talk between the gentlemen , noise rising upon noise , and bustle upon bustle , men and boys at last all in motion together , the moment came for setting off ; everything was ready , William took leave , and all of them were gone ; for the three boys , in spite of their mother ’s entreaty , determined to see their brother and Mr. Campbell to the sally - port ; and Mr. Price walked off at the same time to carry back his neighbour ’s newspaper .
Mrs. Price	Something like tranquillity might now be hoped for ; and accordingly , when Rebecca had been prevailed on to carry away the tea - things , and Mrs. Price had walked about the room some time looking for a shirt - sleeve , which Betsey at last hunted out from a drawer in the kitchen , the small party of females were pretty well composed , and the mother having lamented again over the impossibility of getting Sam ready in time , was at leisure to think of her eldest daughter and the friends she had come from .
Mrs. Price	A few inquiries began : but one of the earliest—“How did sister Bertram manage about her servants ? ” “ Was she as much plagued as herself to get tolerable servants?”—soon led her mind away from Northamptonshire , and
Mrs. Price	fixed it on her own domestic grievances , and the shocking character of all the Portsmouth servants , of whom she believed her own two were the very worst , engrossed her completely .
Mrs. Price	modestly presuming that her mother meant to part with her when her year was up
Mrs. Price	“ Her year ! ” cried Mrs. Price ; “ I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her before she has staid a year , for that will not be up till November .
Mrs. Price	Servants are come to such a pass , my dear , in Portsmouth , that it is quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year .
Mrs. Price	I have no hope of ever being settled ; and if I was to part with Rebecca , I should only get something worse .
Mrs. Price	And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress to please ; and I am sure the place is easy enough ,
Mrs. Price	for there is always a girl under her , and I often do half the work myself
Mrs. Price	The sight of Betsey brought the image of little Mary back again , but she would not have pained her mother by alluding to her for the world .
Mrs. Price	Up jumped Susan , claiming it as her own , and trying to get it away ; but the child ran to her mother ’s protection ,
Mrs. Price	“ It was very hard that she was not to have her _ own _ knife ; it was her own knife ; little sister Mary had left it to her upon her deathbed , and she ought to have had it to keep herself long ago .
Mrs. Price	But mama kept it from her , and was always letting Betsey get hold of it ; and the end of it would be that Betsey would spoil it , and get it for her own , though mama had _ promised _ her that Betsey should not have it in her own hands .
Mrs. Price	Every feeling of duty , honour , and tenderness was wounded by her sister ’s speech and her mother ’s reply .
Mrs. Price	“ Now , Susan , ” cried Mrs. Price , in a complaining voice , “ now , how can you be so cross ?
Mrs. Price	I wish you would not be so quarrelsome .
Mrs. Price	But you should not have taken it out , my dear , when I sent you to the drawer .
Mrs. Price	You know I told you not to touch it , because Susan is so cross about it .
Mrs. Price	I must hide it another time , Betsey .
Mrs. Price	Poor Mary little thought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep , only two hours before she died .
Mrs. Price	she could but just speak to be heard , and she said so prettily , ‘ Let sister Susan have my knife , mama , when I am dead and buried .
Mrs. Price	Fanny , fatigued and fatigued again , was thankful to accept the first invitation of going to bed ; and before Betsey had finished her cry at being allowed to sit up only one hour extraordinary in honour of sister , she was off , leaving all below in confusion and noise again ; the boys begging for toasted cheese , her father calling out for his rum and water , and Rebecca never where she ought to be .
Mrs. Price	The smallness of the rooms above and below , indeed , and the narrowness of the passage and staircase , struck her beyond her imagination .
Mrs. Price	She soon learned to think with respect of her own little attic at Mansfield Park , in _ that _ house reckoned too small for anybody ’s comfort .
Lady Bertram	In the fullness of his belief that such a thing must be , he mentioned its probability to his wife ; and the first time of the subject ’s occurring to her again happening to be when Fanny was present , she calmly observed to her , “ So , Fanny , you are going to leave us , and live with my sister .
Lady Bertram	Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt ’s words , “ Going to leave you ? ”
Lady Bertram	“ Yes , my dear ; why should you be astonished ?
Lady Bertram	You have been five years with us , and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died .
Lady Bertram	But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same . ” The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected .
Lady Bertram	“ I hope I am not ungrateful , aunt , ” said Fanny modestly .
Lady Bertram	Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart ; she could not feel the difference to be so small , she could not think of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction .
Lady Bertram	My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you .
Lady Bertram	She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought , and I am glad her love of money does not interfere .
Lady Bertram	You will be what you ought to be to her .
Lady Bertram	You know how uncomfortable I feel with her . ”
Lady Bertram	“ I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child ; but it was the same with us all , or nearly so .
Lady Bertram	She never knew how to be pleasant to children .
Lady Bertram	But you are now of an age to be treated better ; I think she is behaving better already ; and when you are her only companion , you _ must _ be important to her .
Lady Bertram	“ You are too kind , ” said Fanny , colouring at such praise ; “ how shall I ever thank you as I ought , for thinking so well of me .
Lady Bertram	cousin , if I am to go away , I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life . ” “ Why , indeed , Fanny , I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House .
Lady Bertram	The only difference will be that , living with your aunt , you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be .
Lady Bertram	_ Here _ there are too many whom you can hide behind ; but with _ her _ you will be forced to speak for yourself . ” “ Oh !
Lady Bertram	Fanny sighed , and said , “ I can not see things as you do ; but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself ,
Lady Bertram	and I am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be .
Lady Bertram	If I could suppose my aunt really to care for me , it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody .
Lady Bertram	To prevent its being expected , she had fixed on the smallest habitation which could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish , the White House being only just large enough to receive herself and her servants , and allow a spare room for a friend , of which she made a very particular point .
Lady Bertram	Not all her precautions , however , could save her from being suspected of something better ; or , perhaps , her very display of the importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose it really intended for Fanny .
Lady Bertram	Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris — “ I think , sister , we need not keep Miss Lee any longer , when Fanny goes to live with you . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Live with me , dear Lady Bertram !
Lady Bertram	I thought you had settled it with Sir Thomas . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Me !
Lady Bertram	I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas , nor he to me .
Lady Bertram	Fanny live with me !
Lady Bertram	the last thing in the world for me to think of , or for anybody to wish that really knows us both .
Lady Bertram	what could I do with Fanny ?
Lady Bertram	Me !
Lady Bertram	a poor , helpless , forlorn widow , unfit for anything , my spirits quite broke down ; what could I do with a girl at her time of life ?
Lady Bertram	Sir Thomas is too much my friend .
Lady Bertram	that wishes me well
Lady Bertram	, I am sure , would
Lady Bertram	“ Indeed , I do not know .
Lady Bertram	I suppose he thought it best . ”
Lady Bertram	He could not say he _ wished _ me to take Fanny .
Lady Bertram	I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it . ”
Lady Bertram	“ No ; he only said he thought it very likely ; and I thought so too .
Lady Bertram	“ Dear sister , if you consider my unhappy state , how can she be any comfort to me ?
Lady Bertram	Here am I , a poor desolate widow , deprived of the best of husbands , my health gone in attending and nursing him , my spirits still worse , all my peace in this world destroyed , with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman , and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed — what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny ?
Lady Bertram	If I could wish it for my own sake , I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl .
Lady Bertram	I must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as I can .
Lady Bertram	” “ Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone ? ” “ Lady Bertram , I do not complain .
Lady Bertram	I know I can not live as I have done , but I must retrench where I can , and learn to be a better manager .
Lady Bertram	I _ have _ _ been _ a liberal housekeeper enough , but I shall not be ashamed to practise economy now .
Lady Bertram	My situation is as much altered as my income .
Lady Bertram	A great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris , as clergyman of the parish , that can not be expected from me .
Lady Bertram	I _ must _ live within my income , or I shall be miserable ; and I own it would give me great satisfaction
Lady Bertram	” “ I dare say you will .
Lady Bertram	You always do , do n’t you ? ”
Lady Bertram	“ My object , Lady Bertram , is to be of use to those that come after me .
Lady Bertram	It is for your children ’s good that I wish to be richer .
Lady Bertram	I have nobody else to care for , but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little trifle among them worth their having . ”
Lady Bertram	“ You are very good , but do not trouble yourself about them .
Lady Bertram	Sir Thomas has been writing about it , I know . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Well , Lady Bertram , ” said Mrs. Norris , moving to go , “ I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ;
Lady Bertram	He could not but wonder at her refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt ; but , as she took early care to make him , as well as Lady Bertram , understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family , he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which , at the same time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them , would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself . Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal ; and her spontaneous , untaught felicity on the discovery , conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her .
Lady Bertram	; nobody more hated pitiful doings ; the Parsonage , she believed , had never been wanting in comforts of any sort , had never borne a bad character in _ her _ _ time _ , but this was a way of going on that she could not understand .
Lady Bertram	_ Her _ store - room , she thought , might have been good enough for Mrs. Grant to go into .
Lady Bertram	Lady Bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective .
Lady Bertram	She could not enter into the wrongs of an economist , but she felt all the injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant ’s being so well settled in life without being handsome , and expressed her astonishment on that point almost as often , though not so diffusely , as Mrs. Norris discussed the other . These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event arose of such importance in the family , as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies .
Lady Bertram	Lady Bertram , who was a woman of very tranquil feelings , and a temper remarkably easy and indolent , would have contented herself with merely giving up her sister , and thinking no more of the matter ; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity , which could not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to Fanny , to point out the folly of her conduct , and threaten her with all its possible ill consequences .
Lady Bertram	In the evening it was found , according to the predetermination of Mrs. Grant and her sister , that after making up the whist - table there would remain sufficient for a round game , and everybody being as perfectly complying and without a choice as on such occasions they always are , speculation was decided on almost as soon as whist ; and Lady Bertram soon found herself in the critical situation of being applied to for her own choice between the games , and being required either to draw a card for whist or not .
Lady Bertram	She hesitated .
Lady Bertram	“ What shall I do , Sir Thomas ?
Lady Bertram	Whist and speculation ; which will amuse me most ? ” Sir Thomas , after a moment ’s thought , recommended speculation .
Lady Bertram	Here Fanny interposed , however , with anxious protestations of her own equal ignorance ; she had never played the game nor seen it played in her life ; and Lady Bertram felt a moment ’s indecision again ; but upon everybody ’s assuring her that nothing could be so easy , that it was the easiest game on the cards , and Henry Crawford ’s stepping forward with a most earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss Price , and teach them both , it was so settled ; and Sir Thomas , Mrs. Norris , and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime intellectual state and dignity , the remaining six , under Miss Crawford ’s direction , were arranged round the other .
Lady Bertram	Sir Thomas , politely bowing , replied , “ It is the only way , sir , in which I could _ not _ wish you established as a permanent neighbour ; but I hope , and believe , that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey .
Lady Bertram	Edmund , am I saying too much ? ”
Lady Bertram	His business in Antigua had latterly been prosperously rapid , and he came directly from Liverpool , having had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a private vessel , instead of waiting for the packet ; and all the little particulars of his proceedings and events , his arrivals and departures , were most promptly delivered , as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with heartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him — interrupting himself more than once , however , to remark on his good fortune in finding them all at home — coming unexpectedly as he did — all collected together exactly as he could have wished , but dared not depend on .
Lady Bertram	Her aunt Bertram had recollected her on this occasion with an unusual degree of wakefulness .
Lady Bertram	It had really occurred to her , unprompted , that Fanny , preparing for a ball , might be glad of better help than the upper housemaid ’s , and when dressed herself , she actually sent her own maid to assist her ; too late , of course , to be of any use .
Lady Bertram	Mrs. Chapman had just reached the attic floor , when Miss Price came out of her room completely dressed , and only civilities were necessary ; but Fanny felt her aunt ’s attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman could do themselves .
Lady Bertram	Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets — starched up into seeming piety , but with heads full of something very different — especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at — and , in those days , I fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now .
Lady Bertram	“ The mind which does not struggle against itself under _ one _ circumstance , would find objects to distract it in the _ other _ , I believe ; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse better feelings than are begun with .
Lady Bertram	She talked to her aunt Bertram — she must talk to somebody of the ball ; but her aunt had seen so little of what had passed , and had so little curiosity , that it was heavy work .
Lady Bertram	Lady Bertram was not certain of anybody ’s dress or anybody ’s place at supper but her own .
Lady Bertram	“ She could not recollect what it was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes , or what it was that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny : she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finest young man in the room — somebody had whispered something to her
Lady Bertram	; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be . ” And these were her longest speeches and clearest communications : the rest was only a languid “ Yes , yes ; very well ; did you ?
Lady Bertram	I did not see _ that _ ; I should not know one from the other . ”
Lady Bertram	“ I can not think what is the matter with me , ” said Lady Bertram , when the tea - things were removed .
Lady Bertram	“ I feel quite stupid .
Lady Bertram	Fanny , you must do something to keep me awake .
Lady Bertram	I can not work .
Lady Bertram	Fetch the cards ; I feel so very stupid . ”
Lady Bertram	You are to deal , ma’am ; shall I deal for you ? ” Fanny thought and thought again of the difference which twenty - four hours had made in that room , and all that part of the house .
Lady Bertram	“ Yes , ” said Lady Bertram , “ but I wish he was not going away .
Lady Bertram	They are all going away , I think .
Lady Bertram	I wish they would stay at home .
Lady Bertram	This wish was levelled principally at Julia , who had just applied for permission to go to town with Maria ; and as Sir Thomas thought it best for each daughter that the permission should be granted , Lady Bertram , though in her own good - nature she would not have prevented it , was lamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia ’s return , which would otherwise have taken place about this time .
Lady Bertram	followed on Sir Thomas ’s side , tending to reconcile his wife to the arrangement .
Lady Bertram	Everything that a considerate parent _ ought _ to feel was advanced for her use ; and everything that an affectionate mother _ must _ feel in promoting her children ’s enjoyment was attributed to her nature .
Lady Bertram	Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm “ Yes ” ; and at the end of a quarter of an hour ’s silent consideration spontaneously observed , “ Sir Thomas , I have been thinking — and I am very glad we took Fanny
Lady Bertram	“ Yes , ” said Lady Bertram presently ; “ and it is a comfort to think that we shall always have _ her _ . ”
Lady Bertram	The first half - hour was lost , for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together , and unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope for nothing .
Lady Bertram	Sir Thomas Bertram ’s son is somebody ; and now he is in their own line .
Lady Bertram	XLV At about the week ’s end from his return to Mansfield , Tom ’s immediate danger was over , and he was so far pronounced safe as to make his mother perfectly easy ; for being now used to the sight of him in his suffering , helpless state , and hearing only the best , and never thinking beyond what she heard , with no disposition for alarm and no aptitude at a hint , Lady Bertram was the happiest subject in the world for a little medical imposition .
Lady Bertram	Lady Bertram could think nothing less , and Fanny shared her aunt ’s security , till she received a few lines from Edmund , written purposely to give her a clearer idea of his brother ’s situation , and acquaint her with the apprehensions which he and his father had imbibed from the physician with respect to some strong hectic symptoms , which seemed to seize the frame on the departure of the fever .
Lady Bertram	They judged it best that Lady Bertram should not be harassed by alarms which , it was to be hoped , would prove unfounded ; but there was no reason why Fanny should not know the truth .
Lady Bertram	A very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient and the sickroom in a juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram ’s sheets of paper could do .
Lady Bertram	There was not only the debility of recent illness to assist : there was also , as she now learnt , nerves much affected , spirits much depressed to calm and raise , and her own imagination added that there must be a mind to be properly guided . The family were not consumptive , and she was more inclined to hope than fear for her cousin , except when she thought of Miss Crawford ; but Miss Crawford gave her the idea of being the child of good luck , and to her selfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only son . Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten .
Lady Bertram	“ With what intense desire she wants her home , ” was continually on her tongue , as the truest description of a yearning which she could not suppose any schoolboy ’s bosom to feel more keenly .
Lady Bertram	If Mrs. Rushworth could imagine any interfering obligations , Julia was certainly able to quit London whenever she chose .
Lady Bertram	It appeared from one of her aunt ’s letters that Julia had offered to return if wanted , but this was all .
Lady Bertram	It was evident that she would rather remain where she was .
Lady Bertram	She saw the proof of it in Miss Crawford , as well as in her cousins
Lady Bertram	It was so long since Fanny had had any letter from her , that she had some reason to think lightly of the friendship which had been so dwelt on .
Lady Bertram	It was weeks since she had heard anything of Miss Crawford or of her other connexions in town , except through Mansfield , and she was beginning to suppose that she might never know whether Mr. Crawford had gone into Norfolk again or not till they met , and might never hear from his sister any more this spring , when the following letter was received to revive old and create some new sensations — “ Forgive me , my dear Fanny , as soon as you can , for my long silence , and behave as if you could forgive me directly .
Lady Bertram	Mrs. R. has been spending the Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham ( as to be sure you know ) , and is not yet returned ; and Julia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square , but I forget their name and street .
Lady Bertram	I suppose Mrs. R. ’s Easter holidays will not last much longer ; no doubt they are thorough holidays to her .
Lady Bertram	The Aylmers are pleasant people ; and her husband away , she can have nothing but enjoyment .
Lady Bertram	I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down to Bath , to fetch his mother ; but how will she and the dowager agree in one house ?
Lady Bertram	Mrs. R. knows a decline is apprehended ; he saw her this morning : she returns to Wimpole Street
Lady Bertram	to - day ; the old lady is come .
Lady Bertram	To be finding herself , perhaps within three days , transported to Mansfield , was an image of the greatest felicity , but it would have been a material drawback to be owing such felicity to persons in whose feelings and conduct , at the present moment , she saw so much to condemn : the sister ’s feelings , the brother ’s conduct , _ her _ cold - hearted ambition , _ his _ thoughtless vanity .
Lady Bertram	To have him still the acquaintance , the flirt perhaps , of Mrs. Rushworth !
Lady Bertram	Happily , however , she was not left to weigh and decide between opposite inclinations and doubtful notions of right ; there was no occasion to determine whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not .
Lady Bertram	She thanked Miss Crawford , but gave a decided negative .
Lady Bertram	Everybody at all addicted to letter - writing , without having much to say , which will include a large proportion of the female world at least , must feel with Lady Bertram that she was out of luck in having such a capital piece of Mansfield news as the certainty of the Grants going to Bath , occur at a time when she could make no advantage of it , and will admit that it must have been very mortifying to her to see it fall to the share of her thankless son , and treated as concisely as possible at the end of a long letter , instead of having it to spread over the largest part of a page of her own .
Lady Bertram	Lady Bertram rather shone in the epistolary line , having early in her marriage , from the want of other employment , and the circumstance of Sir Thomas ’s being in Parliament , got into the way of making and keeping correspondents , and formed for herself a very creditable , common - place , amplifying style , so that a very little matter was enough for her : she could not do entirely without any ; she must have something to write about , even to her niece ; and being so soon to lose all the benefit of Dr. Grant ’s gouty symptoms and Mrs. Grant ’s morning calls , it was very hard upon her to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she could put them to .
Lady Bertram	There was a rich amends , however , preparing for her .
Lady Bertram	Lady Bertram ’s hour of good luck came .
Lady Bertram	Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund ’s letter , Fanny had one from her aunt , beginning thus — “ My Dear Fanny,—I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming intelligence , which I make no doubt will give you much concern ” . This was a great deal better than to have to take up the pen to acquaint her with all the particulars of the Grants ’ intended journey , for the present intelligence was of a nature to promise occupation for the pen for many days to come , being no less than the dangerous illness of her eldest son , of which they had received notice by express a few hours before .
Lady Bertram	She could just find selfishness enough to wonder whether Edmund _ had _ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came , but no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate and disinterestedly anxious .
Lady Bertram	The sufferings which Lady Bertram did not see had little power over her fancy ; and she wrote very comfortably about agitation , and anxiety , and poor invalids , till Tom was actually conveyed to Mansfield , and her own eyes had beheld his altered appearance .
Lady Bertram	Then a letter which she had been previously preparing for Fanny was finished in a different style , in the language of real feeling and alarm ; then she wrote as she might have spoken .
Lady Bertram	“ He is just come , my dear Fanny , and is taken upstairs ; and I am so shocked to see him , that I do not know what to do .
Lady Bertram	I am sure he has been very ill .
Lady Bertram	I am quite grieved for him , and very much frightened , and so is Sir Thomas ; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me .
Lady Bertram	Lady Bertram wrote her daily terrors to her niece , who might now be said to live upon letters , and pass all her time between suffering from that of to - day and looking forward to to - morrow ’s .
Lady Bertram	Without any particular affection for her eldest cousin , her tenderness of heart made her feel that she could not spare him , and the purity of her principles added yet a keener solicitude , when she considered how little useful , how little self - denying his life had ( apparently ) been . Susan was her only companion and listener on this , as on more common occasions .
Lady Bertram	Nobody else could be interested in so remote an evil as illness in a family above an hundred miles off ; not even Mrs. Price , beyond a brief question or two , if she saw her daughter with a letter in her hand , and now and then the quiet observation of , “ My poor sister Bertram must be in a great deal of trouble . ”
Lady Bertram	Mrs. Price did quite as much for Lady Bertram as Lady Bertram would have done for Mrs. Price .
Lady Bertram	Three or four Prices might have been swept away , any or all except Fanny and William , and Lady Bertram would have thought little about it ; or perhaps might have caught from Mrs. Norris ’s lips the ca nt of its being a very happy thing and a great blessing to their poor dear sister Price to have them so well provided for .
Lady Bertram	Tom ’s complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his sister ’s conduct , and his recovery so much thrown back by it , that even Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference , and all her alarms were regularly sent off to her husband ; and Julia ’s elopement , the additional blow which had met him on his arrival in London , though its force had been deadened at the moment , must , she knew , be sorely felt . She saw that it was .
Mrs. Grant	There was another family living actually held for Edmund ; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir Thomas ’s conscience , he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice , and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction , in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been able to say or do .
Mrs. Grant	“ I blush for you , Tom , ” said he , in his most dignified manner ; “ I blush for the expedient which I am driven on , and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion .
Mrs. Grant	You have robbed Edmund for ten , twenty , thirty years , perhaps for life , of more than half the income which ought to be his .
Mrs. Grant	It may hereafter be in my power , or in yours ( I hope it will ) , to procure him better preferment ; but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us , and that nothing can , in fact , be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts . ”
Mrs. Grant	Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow ; but escaping as quickly as possible , could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect , firstly , that he had not been half so much in debt as some of his friends ; secondly , that his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it ; and , thirdly , that the future incumbent , whoever he might be , would , in all probability , die very soon . On Mr. Norris ’s death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant , who came consequently to reside at Mansfield ; and on proving to be a hearty man of forty - five , seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram ’s calculations .
Mrs. Grant	The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister - in - law to claim her share in their niece , the change in Mrs. Norris ’s situation , and the improvement in Fanny ’s age , seeming not merely to do away any former objection to their living together , but even to give it the most decided eligibility ; and as his own circumstances were rendered less fair than heretofore , by some recent losses on his West India estate , in addition to his eldest son ’s extravagance , it became not undesirable to himself to be relieved from the expense of her support , and the obligation of her future provision .
Mrs. Grant	It is for your children ’s good that I wish to be richer .
Mrs. Grant	They are sure of being well provided for .
Mrs. Grant	Mrs. Norris took possession of the White House , the Grants arrived at the Parsonage , and these events over , everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual .
Mrs. Grant	The Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable , gave great satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance .
Mrs. Grant	They had their faults , and Mrs. Norris soon found them out .
Mrs. Grant	The Doctor was very fond of eating , and would have a good dinner every day ; and Mrs. Grant , instead of contriving to gratify him at little expense , gave her cook as high wages as they did at Mansfield Park , and was scarcely ever seen in her offices .
Mrs. Grant	_ Her _ store - room , she thought , might have been good enough for Mrs. Grant to go into .
Mrs. Grant	Inquire where she would , she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds .
Mrs. Grant	She could not enter into the wrongs of an economist , but she felt all the injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant ’s being so well settled in life without being handsome , and expressed her astonishment on that point almost as often , though not so diffusely , as Mrs. Norris discussed the other . These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event arose of such importance in the family , as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies .
Mrs. Grant	Sir Thomas found it expedient to go to Antigua himself , for the better arrangement of his affairs , and he took his eldest son with him , in the hope of detaching him from some bad connexions at home .
Mrs. Grant	The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light , and the hope of its utility to his son , reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the rest of his family , and of leaving his daughters to the direction of others at their present most interesting time of life .
Mrs. Grant	The Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion : not for their sorrow , but for their want of it .
Mrs. Grant	Their father was no object of love to them
Mrs. Grant	They were relieved by it from all restraint ; and without aiming at one gratification that would probably have been forbidden by Sir Thomas , they felt themselves immediately at their own disposal , and to have every indulgence within their reach .
Mrs. Grant	Fanny ’s relief , and her consciousness of it , were quite equal to her cousins ’ ; but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings were ungrateful , and she really grieved because she could not grieve .
Mrs. Grant	Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity . ” “ Was Mrs. Grant in the room , then ? ” “ Yes , when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in .
Mrs. Grant	“ And Mrs. Grant , did she say — did she speak ; was she there all the time ? ” “ Yes , she was agreeing exactly with her sister .
Mrs. Grant	You have now given exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant , and they were both better satisfied , though your warm - hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry .
Mrs. Grant	“ It is not worth complaining about ; but to be sure the poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time ; and it is impossible to help wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days we wanted .
Mrs. Grant	It was but three days ; and being only a grandmother , and all happening two hundred miles off , I think there would have been no great harm , and it was suggested , I know ; but Lord Ravenshaw , who I suppose is one of the most correct men in England ,
Mrs. Grant	“ Lovers ’ Vows were at an end , and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother by themselves .
Mrs. Grant	He was determined to prevent it , if possible , though his mother , who equally heard the conversation which passed at table , did not evince the least disapprobation .
Mrs. Grant	And as to my father ’s being absent , it is so far from an objection , that I consider it rather as a motive ; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother ; and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety , and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks , I shall think our time very well spent , and so , I am sure , will he .
Mrs. Grant	It is a _ very _ anxious period for her .
Mrs. Grant	As he said this , each looked towards their mother .
Mrs. Grant	“ To be sure , my dear mother , your anxiety — I was unlucky there . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ What is the matter ? ” asked her ladyship , in the heavy tone of one half - roused ; “ I was not asleep . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ Oh dear , no , ma’am , nobody suspected you !
Mrs. Grant	Their mother had no objection to the plan , and they were not in the least afraid of their father ’s disapprobation .
Mrs. Grant	Julia _ did _ seem inclined to admit that Maria ’s situation might require particular caution and delicacy — but that could not extend to _ her_—she was at liberty ; and Maria evidently considered her engagement as only raising her so much more above restraint , and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult either father or mother .
Mrs. Grant	Edmund had little to hope , but he was still urging the subject when Henry Crawford entered the room , fresh from the Parsonage , calling out , “ No want of hands in our theatre , Miss Bertram .
Mrs. Grant	No want of understrappers : my sister desires her love , and hopes to be admitted into the company , and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante , that you may not like to do yourselves .
Mrs. Grant	“ Very well , ” was her ladyship ’s contented answer ; “ then speculation , if you please , Mrs. Grant .
Mrs. Grant	I know nothing about it , but Fanny must teach me . ”
Mrs. Grant	Here Fanny interposed , however , with anxious protestations of her own equal ignorance ; she had never played the game nor seen it played in her life ; and Lady Bertram felt a moment ’s indecision again ; but upon everybody ’s assuring her that nothing could be so easy , that it was the easiest game on the cards , and Henry Crawford ’s stepping forward with a most earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss Price , and teach them both , it was so settled ; and Sir Thomas , Mrs. Norris , and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime intellectual state and dignity , the remaining six , under Miss Crawford ’s direction , were arranged round the other .
Mrs. Grant	Twice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of his lady , but in vain ; no pause was long enough for the time his measured manner needed ; and very little of her state could be known till Mrs. Grant was able , at the end of the first rubber , to go to her and pay her compliments . “ I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game . ”
Mrs. Grant	One advantage resulted from it to Fanny : at the earnest request of Miss Crawford , Mrs. Grant had , with her usual good - humour , agreed to undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted ; and this was all that occurred to gladden _ her _ heart during the day ; and even this , when imparted by Edmund , brought a pang with it , for it was Miss
Mrs. Grant	Mrs. Grant was of consequence : _ her _ good - nature had honourable mention ; her taste and her time were considered ; her presence was wanted ; she was sought for , and attended , and praised ; and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her the character she had accepted .
Mrs. Grant	But reflection brought better feelings , and shewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect , which could never have belonged to _ her _ ; and that , had she received even the greatest , she could never have been easy in joining a scheme which , considering only her uncle , she must condemn altogether .
Mrs. Grant	For a day or two after the affront was given , Henry Crawford had endeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and compliment , but he had not cared enough about it to persevere against a few repulses ; and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for more than one flirtation , he grew indifferent to the quarrel , or rather thought it a lucky occurrence , as quietly putting an end to what might ere long have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant .
Mrs. Grant	Will not that do , Mrs. Grant ?
Mrs. Grant	Julia _ did _ suffer , however , though Mrs. Grant discerned it not , and though it escaped the notice of many of her own family likewise .
Mrs. Grant	She had loved , she did love still , and she had all the suffering which a warm temper and a high spirit were likely to endure under the disappointment of a dear , though irrational hope , with a strong sense of ill - usage .
Mrs. Grant	Her heart was sore and angry , and she was capable only of angry consolations .
Mrs. Grant	The sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become her greatest enemy : they were alienated from each other ; and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the attentions which were still carrying on there , some punishment to Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr. Rushworth .
Mrs. Grant	“ I come from Dr. Grant ’s , ” said Edmund presently .
Mrs. Grant	She could think of William the next day more cheerfully ; and as the morning afforded her an opportunity of talking over Thursday night with Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford , in a very handsome style , with all the heightenings of imagination , and all the laughs of playfulness which are so essential to the shade of a departed ball , she could afterwards bring her mind without much effort into its everyday state , and easily conform to the tranquillity of the present quiet week . They were indeed a smaller party than she had ever known there for a whole day together , and _ he _ was gone on whom the comfort and cheerfulness of every family meeting and every meal chiefly depended .
Mrs. Grant	I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near .
Mrs. Grant	She does not like my going . ” Fanny felt obliged to speak .
Mrs. Grant	I like to hear her talk .
Mrs. Grant	But I think her present home must do her good .
Mrs. Grant	Mrs. Grant ’s manners are just what they ought to be .
Mrs. Grant	She speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ Yes , except as to his writing her such short letters .
Mrs. Grant	She made me almost laugh ; but I can not rate so very highly the love or good - nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters , when they are separated .
Mrs. Grant	And what right had she to suppose that _ you _ would not write long letters when you were absent ? ” “ The right of a lively mind , Fanny , seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others ; perfectly allowable , when untinctured by ill - humour or roughness ; and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford : nothing sharp , or loud , or coarse .
Mrs. Grant	Mrs. Grant and her tambour
Mrs. Grant	frame were not without their use : it was all in harmony ; and as everything will turn to account when love is once set going , even the sandwich tray , and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it , were worth looking at .
Mrs. Grant	Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning ; she would gladly have been there too , might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed , to hear the harp ; neither could she wonder that , when the evening stroll was over , and the two families parted again , he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home , while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park ; but she thought it a very bad exchange ; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and water for her , would rather go without it than not .
Mrs. Grant	The houses , though scarcely half a mile apart , were not within sight of each other ; but , by walking fifty yards from the hall door , she could look down the park , and command a view of the Parsonage and all its demesnes , gently rising beyond the village road ; and in Dr. Grant ’s meadow she immediately saw the group — Edmund and Miss Crawford both on horse - back , riding side by side , Dr. and Mrs. Grant , and Mr. Crawford , with two or three grooms , standing about and looking on .
Mrs. Grant	She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common : Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views , and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it .
Mrs. Grant	It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant , with perfect good - humour , on Mr. Rushworth ’s account , who was partly expected at the Park that day ; but it was felt as a very grievous injury , and her good manners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home .
Mrs. Grant	Here are many that would be interested in your improvements , my dear Mr. Rushworth , and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford ’s opinion on the spot , and that might be of some small use to you with _ their _ opinions ; and , for my own part , I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again ; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss ; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth , while the rest of you walked about and settled things , and
Mrs. Grant	Miss Bertram ’s engagement made him in equity the property of Julia , of which Julia was fully aware ; and before he had been at Mansfield a week , she was quite ready to be fallen in love with .
Mrs. Grant	Maria ’s notions on the subject were more confused and indistinct .
Mrs. Grant	She did not want to see or understand .
Mrs. Grant	“ There could be no harm in her liking an agreeable man — everybody knew her situation — Mr. Crawford must take care of himself . ”
Mrs. Grant	, he allowed himself great latitude on such points . “ I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly , sister , ” said he , as he returned from attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit ; “ they are very elegant , agreeable girls . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ So they are indeed , and I am delighted to hear you say it .
Mrs. Grant	But you like Julia best . ”
Mrs. Grant	I like Julia best . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ But do you really ?
Mrs. Grant	for Miss Bertram is in general thought the
Mrs. Grant	“ So I should suppose .
Mrs. Grant	She has the advantage in every feature , and I prefer her countenance ; but I like Julia best ; Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest , and I have found her the most agreeable , but I shall always like Julia best , because you order me . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ I shall not talk to you , Henry , but I know you _ will _ like her best at last . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ Do not I tell you that I like her best _ at _ _ first _ ? ”
Mrs. Grant	“ And besides , Miss Bertram is engaged .
Mrs. Grant	Remember that , my dear brother .
Mrs. Grant	Her choice is made . ” “ Yes , and I like her the better for it .
Mrs. Grant	Her cares are over , and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion .
Mrs. Grant	“ Why , as to that , Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man , and it is a great match for her . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him ; _ that _ is your opinion of your intimate friend .
Mrs. Grant	_ I _ do not subscribe to it .
Mrs. Grant	I am sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth .
Mrs. Grant	I could see it in her eyes , when he was mentioned .
Mrs. Grant	I think too well of Miss Bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart .
Mrs. Grant	“ Mary , how shall we manage him ? ” “ We must leave him to himself , I believe .
Mrs. Grant	With all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married , my dear Mrs. Grant , there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry .
Mrs. Grant	Look where I will , I see that it _ is _ so ; and I feel that it _ must _ be so , when I consider that it is , of all transactions , the one in which people expect most from others , and are least honest themselves . ”
Mrs. Grant	You have been in a bad school for matrimony , in Hill Street . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state ; but , however , speaking from my own observation , it is a manoeuvring business .
Mrs. Grant	I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion , or accomplishment , or good quality in the person , who have found themselves entirely deceived , and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse .
Mrs. Grant	“ My dear child , there must be a little imagination here .
Mrs. Grant	I beg your pardon , but I can not quite believe you .
Mrs. Grant	“ Well done , sister !
Mrs. Grant	I honour your _ esprit _ _ du _ _ corps _ .
Mrs. Grant	It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both with her , and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so : a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society to an indolent , stay - at - home man ; and Mr. Crawford ’s being his guest was an excuse for drinking claret every day
Mrs. Grant	The Miss Bertrams ’ admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than anything which Miss Crawford ’s habits made her likely to feel .
Mrs. Grant	She
Mrs. Grant	She had felt an early presentiment that she _ should _ like the eldest best . She knew it was her way .
Mrs. Grant	Miss Crawford soon felt that he and his situation might do .
Mrs. Grant	“ I begin now to understand you all , except Miss Price
Mrs. Grant	, ” said Miss Crawford , as she was walking with the Mr. Bertrams .
Mrs. Grant	She dined at the Parsonage , with the rest of you , which seemed like being _ out _ ; and yet she says so little , that I can hardly suppose she _ is _ . ”
Mrs. Grant	Edmund , to whom this was chiefly addressed , replied , “ I believe I know what you mean , but I will not undertake to answer the question .
Mrs. Grant	Till now , I could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl ’s being out or not .
Mrs. Grant	You may smile , but it is so , I
Mrs. Grant	Mr. Bertram , I dare say _ you _ have sometimes met with such changes .
Mrs. Grant	“ I believe I have , but this is hardly fair ; I see what you are at .
Mrs. Grant	You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson . ”
Mrs. Grant	Miss Anderson !
Mrs. Grant	I do not know who or what you mean .
Mrs. Grant	I am quite in the dark .
Mrs. Grant	But I _ will _ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure , if you will tell me what about .
Mrs. Grant	you carry it off very well , but I can not be quite so far imposed
Mrs. Grant	You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye , in describing an altered young lady .
Mrs. Grant	You paint too accurately for mistake .
Mrs. Grant	We were speaking of them the other day , you know .
Mrs. Grant	Edmund , you have heard me mention Charles Anderson .
Mrs. Grant	The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it .
Mrs. Grant	When Anderson first introduced me to his family , about two years ago , his sister was not _ out _ , and I could not get her to speak to me .
Mrs. Grant	I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson , with only her and a little girl or two in the room , the governess being sick or run away , and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business , and I could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady — nothing like a civil answer — she screwed up her mouth , and turned from me with such an air ! I did not see her again for a twelvemonth .
Mrs. Grant	She was then _ out _ .
Mrs. Grant	I met her at Mrs. Holford ’s , and did not recollect her .
Mrs. Grant	She came up to me , claimed me as an acquaintance , stared me out of countenance ; and talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look .
Mrs. Grant	I felt that I must be the jest of the room at the time , and Miss Crawford , it is plain , has heard the story .
Mrs. Grant	“ And a very pretty story it is , and with more truth in it , I dare say , than does credit to Miss Anderson .
Mrs. Grant	I do not know where the error lies .
Mrs. Grant	I do not pretend to set people right , but I do see that they are often wrong . ”
Mrs. Grant	The close bonnet and demure air you describe so well ( and nothing was ever juster ) , tell one what is expected ; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them .
Mrs. Grant	— you have heard me speak of Sneyd , Edmund — his father , and mother , and sisters , were there , all new to me .
Mrs. Grant	I made my bow in form ; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men , attached myself to one of her daughters , walked by her side all the way home , and made myself as agreeable as I could ; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners , and as ready to talk as to listen .
Mrs. Grant	I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong .
Mrs. Grant	They looked just the same : both well - dressed , with veils and parasols like other girls ; but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the youngest , who was not _ out _ , and had most excessively offended the eldest .
Mrs. Grant	Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months ; and Miss Sneyd , I believe , has never forgiven me .
Mrs. Grant	Though I have no younger sister , I feel for her .
Mrs. Grant	But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price .
Mrs. Grant	Does she dine out every where , as well as at my sister ’s ? ” “ No , ” replied Edmund ; “ I do not think she has ever been to a ball .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris , on quitting the Parsonage
Mrs. Norris	In the fullness of his belief that such a thing must be , he mentioned its probability to his wife ; and the first time of the subject ’s occurring to her again happening to be when Fanny was present , she calmly observed to her , “ So , Fanny , you are going to leave us , and live with my sister .
Mrs. Norris	She had never received kindness from her aunt Norris , and could not love her .
Mrs. Norris	“ Yes , I dare say you will ; _ that ’s _ natural enough .
Mrs. Norris	I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ No , my dear ; I hope not .
Mrs. Norris	I have always found you a very good girl . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Never , my dear ; but you are sure of a comfortable home .
Mrs. Norris	“ Cousin , ” said she , “ something is going to happen which I do not like at all ; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first , you will not be able to do it now .
Mrs. Norris	“ Well , Fanny , and if the plan were not unpleasant to you , I should call it an excellent one . ”
Mrs. Norris	My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you .
Mrs. Norris	She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought , and I am glad her love of money does not interfere .
Mrs. Norris	I hope it does not distress you very much , Fanny ? ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child ; but it was the same with us all , or nearly so .
Mrs. Norris	But you are now of an age to be treated better ; I think she is behaving better already ; and when you are her only companion , you _ must _ be important to her .
Mrs. Norris	“ As to your foolishness and awkwardness , my dear Fanny , believe me , you never have a shadow of either , but in using the words so improperly .
Mrs. Norris	You have good sense , and a sweet temper , and I am sure you have a grateful heart , that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it .
Mrs. Norris	I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion . ”
Mrs. Norris	cousin , if I am to go away , I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life . ” “ Why , indeed , Fanny , I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House .
Mrs. Norris	“ I must say it , and say it with pleasure .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now .
Mrs. Norris	She is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about , and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health , and as much for your ultimate happiness too .
Mrs. Norris	So ended their discourse , which , for any very appropriate service it could render Fanny , might as well have been spared , for Mrs. Norris had not the smallest intention of taking her .
Mrs. Norris	It had never occurred to her , on the present occasion , but as a thing to be carefully avoided .
Mrs. Norris	Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris — “ I think , sister , we need not keep Miss Lee any longer , when Fanny goes to live with you . ”
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris almost started .
Mrs. Norris	“ Live with me , dear Lady Bertram !
Mrs. Norris	what do you mean ? ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Is she not to live with you ?
Mrs. Norris	I thought you had settled it with Sir Thomas . ”
Mrs. Norris	How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it ?
Mrs. Norris	“ Dear sister , if you consider my unhappy state , how can she be any comfort to me ?
Mrs. Norris	“ Why , you know , Sir Thomas ’s means will be rather straitened if the Antigua estate is to make such poor returns . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Well , Lady Bertram , ” said Mrs. Norris , moving to go , “ I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ;
Mrs. Norris	besides that , I really should not have a bed to give her , for I must keep a spare room for a friend . ”
Mrs. Norris	Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to convince him how much he had mistaken his sister - in - law ’s views ; and she was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation , or the slightest allusion to it from him .
Mrs. Norris	He could not but wonder at her refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt ; but , as she took early care to make him , as well as Lady Bertram , understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family , he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which , at the same time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them , would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself . Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal ; and her spontaneous , untaught felicity on the discovery , conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris took possession of the White House , the Grants arrived at the Parsonage , and these events over , everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual .
Mrs. Norris	They had their faults , and Mrs. Norris soon found them out .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris could not speak with any temper of such grievances , nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly
Mrs. Norris	“ Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself
Mrs. Norris	; nobody more hated pitiful doings ; the Parsonage , she believed , had never been wanting in comforts of any sort , had never borne a bad character in _ her _ _ time _ , but this was a way of going on that she could not understand .
Mrs. Norris	Inquire where she would , she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds .
Mrs. Norris	She could not enter into the wrongs of an economist , but she felt all the injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant ’s being so well settled in life without being handsome , and expressed her astonishment on that point almost as often , though not so diffusely , as Mrs. Norris discussed the other . These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event arose of such importance in the family , as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies .
Mrs. Norris	He could not think Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them , or rather , to perform what should have been her own ; but , in Mrs. Norris ’s watchful attention , and in Edmund ’s judgment , he had sufficient confidence to make him go without fears for their conduct .
Mrs. Norris	Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her ; but she was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety , or solicitude for his comfort , being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous , or difficult , or fatiguing to anybody but themselves .
Mrs. Norris	I am going to live entirely with my aunt Norris . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Yes ; my aunt Bertram has just told me so .
Mrs. Norris	I am to leave Mansfield Park , and go to the White House , I suppose , as soon as she is removed there . ”
Mrs. Norris	He could not think Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them , or rather , to perform what should have been her own ; but , in Mrs. Norris ’s watchful attention , and in Edmund ’s judgment , he had sufficient confidence to make him go without fears for their conduct .
Mrs. Norris	She had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation ; and such of their acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as handsome as Miss Maria , did not scruple to predict their marrying with almost equal advantage .
Mrs. Norris	Miss Ward , at the end of half a dozen years , found herself obliged to be attached to the Rev. Mr. Norris , a friend of her brother - in - law , with scarcely any private fortune , and Miss Frances fared yet worse .
Mrs. Norris	Miss Ward ’s match , indeed , when it came to the point , was not contemptible : Sir Thomas being happily able to give his friend an income in the living of Mansfield ; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their career of conjugal felicity with very little less than a thousand a year .
Mrs. Norris	But Miss Frances married , in the common phrase , to disoblige her family , and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines , without education , fortune , or connexions , did it very thoroughly .
Mrs. Norris	She could hardly have
Mrs. Norris	from principle as well as pride — from a general wish of doing right , and a desire of seeing all that were connected with him in situations of respectability , he would have been glad to exert for the advantage of Lady Bertram ’s sister ; but her husband ’s profession was such as no interest could reach ; and before he had time to devise any other method of assisting them , an absolute breach between the sisters had taken place .
Mrs. Norris	To save herself from useless remonstrance , Mrs. Price never wrote to her family on the subject till actually married .
Mrs. Norris	Lady Bertram , who was a woman of very tranquil feelings , and a temper remarkably easy and indolent , would have contented herself with merely giving up her sister , and thinking no more of the matter ; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity , which could not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to Fanny , to point out the folly of her conduct , and threaten her with all its possible ill consequences .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Price , in her turn , was injured and angry ;
Mrs. Norris	and an answer , which comprehended each sister in its bitterness , and bestowed such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir Thomas as Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herself , put an end to all intercourse between them for a considerable period . Their homes were so distant , and the circles in which they moved so distinct , as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each other ’s existence during the eleven following years , or , at least , to make it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have it in her power to tell them , as she now and then did , in an angry voice , that Fanny had got another child .
Mrs. Norris	By the end of eleven years , however , Mrs. Price could no longer afford to cherish pride or resentment , or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her .
Mrs. Norris	A large and still increasing family , an husband disabled for active service , but not the less equal to company and good liquor , and a very small income to supply their wants , made her eager to regain the friends she had so carelessly sacrificed ; and she addressed Lady Bertram in a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence , such a superfluity of children , and such a want of almost everything else , as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation .
Mrs. Norris	She was preparing for her ninth lying - in ; and after bewailing the circumstance , and imploring their countenance as sponsors to the expected child
Mrs. Norris	, she could not conceal how important she felt they might be to the future maintenance of the eight already in being .
Mrs. Norris	Her eldest was a boy of ten years old , a fine spirited fellow , who longed to be out in the world ; but what could she do ?
Mrs. Norris	Sir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions , Lady Bertram dispatched money and baby - linen , and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters .
Mrs. Norris	Such were its immediate effects , and within a twelvemonth a more important advantage to Mrs. Price resulted from it .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris was often observing to the others that she could not get her poor sister and her family out of her head , and that , much as they had all done for her , she seemed to be wanting to do more ; and at length she could not but own it to be her wish that poor Mrs. Price should be relieved from the charge and expense of one child entirely out of her great number .
Mrs. Norris	“ What if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter , a girl now nine years old , of an age to require more attention than her poor mother could possibly give ?
Mrs. Norris	Lady Bertram agreed with her instantly .
Mrs. Norris	“ I think we can not do better , ” said she ; “ let us send for the child . ”
Mrs. Norris	he deliberately begun to state his objections , than Mrs. Norris interrupted him with a reply to them all , whether stated or not
Mrs. Norris	“ My dear Sir Thomas , I perfectly comprehend you , and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions , which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct ; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one ’s own hands ; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion .
Mrs. Norris	Having no children of my own , who should I look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow , but the children of
Mrs. Norris	my sisters?—and
Mrs. Norris	I am sure Mr. Norris is too just — but you know I am a woman of few words and professions .
Mrs. Norris	A niece of ours , Sir Thomas , I may say , or at least of _ yours _ , would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages .
Mrs. Norris	I do n’t say she would be so handsome as her cousins .
Mrs. Norris	I dare say she would not ; but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable
Mrs. Norris	I never knew an instance of it .
Mrs. Norris	Suppose her a pretty girl , and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence , and I dare say there would be mischief .
Mrs. Norris	But breed her up with them from this time , and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel , and she will never be more to either than a sister . ” “ There is a great deal of truth in what you say , ” replied Sir Thomas , “ and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each .
Mrs. Norris	I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in , and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price , and creditable to ourselves , we must secure to the child , or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter , as circumstances may arise , the provision of a gentlewoman , if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting . ” “ I thoroughly understand you , ” cried Mrs. Norris , “ you are everything that is generous and considerate , and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point .
Mrs. Norris	Whatever I can do , as you well know , I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love ; and , though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children , nor consider her , in any respect , so much my own , I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her .
Mrs. Norris	and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of bread to give her ?
Mrs. Norris	My dear Sir Thomas , with all my faults I have a warm heart ; and , poor as I am , would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing .
Mrs. Norris	So , if you are not against it , I will write to my poor sister tomorrow , and make the proposal ; and , as soon as matters are settled , _ I _ will engage to get the child to Mansfield ; _ you _ shall have no trouble about it .
Mrs. Norris	My own trouble , you know , I never
Mrs. Norris	I will send Nanny to London on purpose , and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler ’s , and the child be appointed to meet her there .
Mrs. Norris	I dare say there is always some reputable tradesman ’s wife or other going up .
Mrs. Norris	The division of gratifying sensations ought not , in strict justice , to have been equal ; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and consistent patron of the selected child , and Mrs. Norris had not the least intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance .
Mrs. Norris	As far as walking , talking , and contriving reached , she was thoroughly benevolent , and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others ; but her love of money was equal to her love of directing , and she knew quite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends .
Mrs. Norris	Having married on a narrower income than she had been used to look forward to , she had , from the first , fancied a very strict line of economy necessary ; and what was begun as a matter of prudence , soon grew into a matter of choice , as an object of that needful solicitude which there were no children to supply . Had there been a family to provide for
Mrs. Norris	, Mrs. Norris might never have saved her money ; but having no care of that kind , there was nothing to impede her frugality , or lessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they had never lived up to . Under this infatuating principle , counteracted by no real affection for her sister , it was impossible for her to aim at more than the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity ; though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk home to the Parsonage , after this conversation , in the happy belief of being the most liberal - minded sister and aunt in the world . When the subject was brought forward again , her views were more fully explained ; and , in reply to Lady Bertram ’s calm inquiry of “ Where shall the child come to first , sister , to you or to us ? ”
Mrs. Norris	Sir Thomas heard with some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris ’s power to take any share in the personal charge of her .
Mrs. Norris	He had been considering her as a particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage , as a desirable companion to an aunt who had no children of her own ; but he found himself wholly mistaken .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris was sorry to say that the little girl ’s staying with them , at least as things then were , was quite out of the question .
Mrs. Norris	Poor Mr. Norris ’s indifferent state of health
Mrs. Norris	: he could no more bear the noise of a child than he could fly ; if , indeed , he should ever get well of his gouty complaints , it would be a different matter : she should then be glad to take her turn , and think nothing of the inconvenience ; but
Mrs. Norris	just now , poor Mr. Norris took up every moment of her time , and the very mention of such a thing she was sure would distract him .
Mrs. Norris	“ Then she had better come to us , ” said Lady Bertram , with the utmost composure .
Mrs. Norris	“ Very true , ” cried Mrs. Norris , “ which are both very important considerations ; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she has three girls to teach , or only two — there can be no difference .
Mrs. Norris	only wish I could be more useful ; but you see I do all in my power .
Mrs. Norris	I am not one of those that spare their own trouble ; and Nanny shall fetch her , however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days .
Mrs. Norris	I suppose , sister , you will put the child in the little white attic , near the old nurseries .
Mrs. Norris	It will be much the best place for her , so near Miss Lee , and not far from the girls , and close by the housemaids , who could either of them help to dress her , you know , and take care of her clothes , for I suppose you would not think it fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others .
Mrs. Norris	Lady Bertram made no opposition .
Mrs. Norris	“ I hope she will prove a well - disposed girl , ” continued Mrs. Norris , “ and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ That is exactly what I think , ” cried Mrs. Norris , “ and what I was saying to my husband this morning .
Mrs. Norris	, said I , only being with her cousins ; if Miss Lee taught her nothing , she would learn to be good and clever from _ them _ . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I hope she will not tease my poor pug , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ I have but just got Julia to leave it alone . ” “ There will be some difficulty in our way , Mrs. Norris , ” observed Sir Thomas , “ as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up : how to preserve in the minds of my _ daughters _ the consciousness of what they are , without making them think too lowly of their cousin ; and how , without depressing her spirits too far , to make her remember that she is not a _ Miss Bertram _ .
Mrs. Norris	It is a point of great delicacy , and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris was quite at his service ; and though she perfectly agreed with him as to its being a most difficult thing , encouraged him to hope that between them it would be easily managed .
Mrs. Norris	It will be readily believed that Mrs. Norris did not write to her sister in vain .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised that a girl should be fixed on , when she had so many fine boys , but accepted the offer most thankfully , assuring them of her daughter ’s being a very well - disposed , good - humoured girl , and trusting they would never have cause to throw her off .
Mrs. Norris	She spoke of her farther as somewhat delicate and puny , but was sanguine in the hope of her being materially better for change of air .
Mrs. Norris	Poor woman !
Mrs. Norris	she probably thought change of air might agree with many of her children .
Mrs. Norris	“ I was just going to say the very same thing , ” said Mrs. Norris .
Mrs. Norris	“ If every play is to be objected to , you will act nothing , and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away , and I am sure _ that _ would be a discredit to us all .
Mrs. Norris	I do not know the play ; but , as Maria says , if there is anything a little too warm ( and it is so with most of them ) it can be easily left out .
Mrs. Norris	I only wish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began , for there was the loss of half a day ’s work about those side - doors .
Mrs. Norris	The maids do their work very well , and I think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings .
Mrs. Norris	I _ am _ of some use , I hope , in preventing waste and making the most of things .
Mrs. Norris	I forgot to tell Tom of something that happened to me this very day .
Mrs. Norris	I had been looking about me in the poultry - yard , and was just coming out , when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants ’ hall - door with two bits of deal board in his hand , bringing them to father , you may be sure ; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father , and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board , for he could not no how do without them .
Mrs. Norris	I knew what all this meant , for the servants ’ dinner - bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads ; and
Mrs. Norris	as I hate such encroaching people ( the Jacksons are very encroaching , I have always said so : just the sort of people to get all they can ) , I said to the boy directly ( a great lubberly fellow of ten years old , you know , who ought to be ashamed of himself ) , ‘ _ I ’ll _ take the boards to your father , Dick , so get you home again as fast as you can . ’
Mrs. Norris	The boy looked very silly , and turned away without offering a word , for I believe I might speak pretty sharp ; and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while .
Mrs. Norris	I hate such greediness — so good as your father is to the family , employing the man all the year round !
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris related again her triumph over Dick Jackson , but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked of , for Edmund ’s disapprobation was felt even by his brother , though he would not have owned it .
Mrs. Norris	The actors may be glad , but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision ; and I do sincerely give you joy , madam , as well as Mrs. Norris , and everybody else who is in the same predicament , ” glancing half fearfully , half slyly , beyond Fanny to
Mrs. Norris	She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram , but Edmund said nothing .
Mrs. Norris	Her entreaty had no effect on Tom : he only said again what he had said before ; and it was not merely Tom , for the requisition was now backed by Maria , and Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Yates , with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious , and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny ; and before she could breathe after it , Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you !
Mrs. Norris	Take the part with a good grace , and let us hear no more of the matter , I entreat . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Do not urge her , madam , ” said Edmund .
Mrs. Norris	You see she does not like to act .
Mrs. Norris	“ I am not going to urge her , ” replied Mrs. Norris sharply ; “ but I shall think her a very obstinate , ungrateful girl , if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her — very ungrateful , indeed , considering who and what she is .
Mrs. Norris	Edmund was too angry to speak ; but Miss Crawford , looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris , and then at Fanny , whose tears were beginning to shew themselves , immediately said , with some keenness , “ I do not like my situation : this _ place _ is too hot for me , ” and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table , close to Fanny , saying to her , in a kind , low whisper , as she placed herself , “ Never mind , my dear Miss Price , this is a cross evening : everybody is cross and teasing , but do not let us mind them ” ;
Mrs. Norris	; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to anybody , and Mrs. Norris , when she came on the morrow , in consequence of an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas , was in a very ill humour , and seemed intent only on lessening her niece ’s pleasure , both present and future , as much as possible
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant ’s part of the favour , that Fanny , who found herself expected to speak , could only say that she was very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her , and that she was endeavouring to put her aunt ’s evening work in such a state as to prevent her being missed .
Mrs. Norris	_ I _ shall be here , so you may be quite easy about your aunt .
Mrs. Norris	And I hope you will have a very _ agreeable _ day , and find it all mighty _ delightful _ .
Mrs. Norris	But I must observe that five is the very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table ; and I can not but be surprised that such an _ elegant _ lady as Mrs. Grant should not contrive better !
Mrs. Norris	However , you will have dinner enough on it for ten , I dare say . ”
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris fetched breath , and went on again . “ The nonsense and folly of people ’s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves , makes me think it right to give _ you _ a hint , Fanny , now that you are going into company without any of us ; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward , and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins — as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia .
Mrs. Norris	_ That _ will never do , believe me .
Mrs. Norris	” “ Yes , ma’am , I should not think of anything else . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ And if it should rain , which I think exceedingly likely , for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life , you must manage as well as you can , and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you .
Mrs. Norris	I certainly do not go home to - night , and , therefore , the carriage will not be out on my account ; so you must make up your mind to what may happen , and take your things accordingly .
Mrs. Norris	She rated her own claims to comfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could ; and when Sir Thomas soon afterwards , just opening the door , said , “ Fanny , at what time would you have the carriage come round ? ” she felt a degree of astonishment which made it impossible for her to speak .
Mrs. Norris	“ Yes , sir , ” was Fanny ’s humble answer , given with the feelings almost of a criminal towards Mrs. Norris ; and not bearing to remain with her in what might seem a state of triumph , she followed her uncle out of the room , having staid behind him only long enough to hear these words spoken in angry agitation — “ Quite unnecessary !
Mrs. Norris	I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night .
Mrs. Norris	She was soon aware of this herself ; for though she must submit , as her own propriety of mind directed , in spite of her aunt Norris ’s opinion , to being the principal lady in company , and to all the little distinctions consequent thereon , she found ,
Mrs. Norris	“ I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I dare say she would , but she has no influence with either Tom or my sisters that could be of any use ; and if I can not convince them myself , I shall let things take their course , without attempting it through her .
Mrs. Norris	Opposition was vain ; and as to Mrs. Norris , he was mistaken in supposing she would wish to make any .
Mrs. Norris	She started no difficulties that were not talked down in five minutes by her eldest nephew and niece , who were all - powerful with her ; and
Mrs. Norris	Miss Crawford , on walking up with her brother to spend the evening at Mansfield Park , heard the good news ; and though seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness , and to have vented all her feelings in a quiet congratulation , heard it with an attention not so easily satisfied .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris gave the particulars of the letters , and the subject was dropt ;
Mrs. Norris	after tea , as Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight scene , while the Miss Bertrams , Mr. Rushworth , and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte , she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group , and saying , “ How happy Mr. Rushworth looks !
Mrs. Norris	“ Do n’t be affronted , ” said she , laughing , “ but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes , who , after performing great exploits in a foreign land , offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ There is no sacrifice in the case , ” replied Edmund , with a serious smile , and glancing at the pianoforte again ; “ it is entirely her own doing . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Oh yes I know it is .
Mrs. Norris	I was merely joking .
Mrs. Norris	She has done no more than what every young woman would do ; and I have no doubt of her being extremely happy .
Mrs. Norris	clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish — read the newspaper , watch the weather , and quarrel with his wife . His curate does all the work , and the business of his own life is to dine . ” “ There are such clergymen , no doubt , but I think they are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character .
Mrs. Norris	You are speaking what you have been told at your uncle ’s table . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle , ” said Miss Crawford , “ that I can hardly suppose — and since you push me so hard , I must observe , that I am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are , being at this present time the guest of my own brother , Dr. Grant .
Mrs. Norris	Besides , I can not but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession , where he would have had less time and obligation — where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself , the _ frequency _ , at least , of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now .
Mrs. Norris	It must make him think ; and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman . ”
Mrs. Norris	Fanny turned farther into the window ; and Miss Crawford had only time to say , in a pleasant manner , “ I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it ” ; when , being earnestly invited by the Miss Bertrams to join in a glee , she tripped off to the instrument , leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many virtues , from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread .
Mrs. Norris	How well she walks ! and how readily she falls in with the inclination of others !
Mrs. Norris	joining them the moment she is asked .
Mrs. Norris	What a pity , ” he added , after an instant ’s reflection , “ that she should have been in such hands ! ”
Mrs. Norris	Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris ’s threats of catching cold .
Mrs. Norris	On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace , Mrs. Rushworth and Mrs. Norris presented themselves at the top , just ready for the wilderness , at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the house .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster .
Mrs. Norris	Whatever cross - accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces , she had found a morning of complete enjoyment ; for the housekeeper , after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants , had taken her to the dairy , told her all about their cows , and given her the receipt for a famous cream cheese ; and since Julia ’s leaving them they had been met by the gardener , with whom she had made a most satisfactory acquaintance , for she had set him right as to his grandson ’s illness , convinced him that it was an ague , and promised him a charm for it ; and he , in return , had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants , and actually presented her with a very curious specimen of heath .
Mrs. Norris	, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage came to the door , and Mrs. Norris , having fidgeted about , and obtained a few pheasants ’ eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper , and made abundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth , was ready to lead the way .
Mrs. Norris	“ Well , Fanny , this has been a fine day for you , upon my word , ” said Mrs. Norris , as they drove through the park .
Mrs. Norris	I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go .
Mrs. Norris	Maria was just discontented enough to say directly , “ I think _ you _ have done pretty well yourself , ma’am .
Mrs. Norris	Your lap seems full of good things , and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully . ”
Mrs. Norris	It was a beautiful evening , mild and still , and the drive was as pleasant as the serenity of Nature could make it ; but when Mrs. Norris ceased speaking , it was altogether a silent drive to those within .
Mrs. Norris	Too late he became aware how unfavourable to the character of any young people must be the totally opposite treatment which Maria and Julia had been always experiencing at home , where the excessive indulgence and flattery of their aunt had been continually contrasted with his own severity .
Mrs. Norris	He saw how ill he had judged , in expecting to counteract what was wrong in Mrs. Norris by its reverse in himself ; clearly saw that he had but increased the evil by teaching them to repress their spirits in his presence so as to make their real disposition unknown to him , and sending them for all their indulgences to a person who had been able to attach them only by the blindness of her affection , and the excess of her praise . Here had been grievous mismanagement ; but , bad as it was , he gradually grew to feel that it had not been the most direful mistake in his plan of education .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris , whose attachment seemed to augment with the demerits of her niece , would have had her received at home and countenanced by them all .
Mrs. Norris	Sir Thomas would not hear of it ; and Mrs. Norris ’s anger against Fanny was so much the greater , from considering _ her _ residence there as the motive .
Mrs. Norris	She persisted in placing his scruples to _ her _ account , though Sir Thomas very solemnly assured her that , had there been no young woman in question , had there been no young person of either sex belonging to him , to be endangered by the society or hurt by the character of Mrs. Rushworth , he would never have offered so great an insult to the neighbourhood as to expect it to notice her .
Mrs. Norris	It ended in Mrs. Norris ’s resolving to quit Mansfield and devote herself to her unfortunate Maria , and in an establishment being formed for them in another country , remote and private , where , shut up together with little society , on one side no affection , on the other no judgment , it may be reasonably supposed that their tempers became their mutual punishment
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris ’s removal from Mansfield was the great supplementary comfort of Sir Thomas ’s life .
Mrs. Norris	His opinion of her had been sinking from
Mrs. Norris	: in every transaction together from that period , in their daily intercourse , in business , or in chat , she had been regularly losing ground in his esteem , and convincing him that either time had done her much disservice , or that he had considerably over - rated her sense , and wonderfully borne with her manners before .
Mrs. Norris	He had felt her as an hourly evil , which was so much the worse , as there seemed no chance of its ceasing but with life ; she seemed a part of himself that must be borne for ever .
Mrs. Norris	To be relieved from her , therefore , was so great a felicity that , had she not left bitter remembrances behind her , there might have been danger of his learning almost to approve the evil which produced such a good .
Mrs. Norris	She was regretted by no one at Mansfield .
Mrs. Norris	She had never been able to attach even those she loved best ; and since Mrs. Rushworth ’s elopement , her temper had been in a state of such irritation as to make her everywhere tormenting .
Mrs. Norris	Not even Fanny had tears for aunt Norris , not even when she was gone for ever .
Mrs. Norris	That Julia escaped better than Maria was owing , in some measure , to a favourable difference of disposition and circumstance , but in a greater to her having been less the darling of that very aunt , less flattered and less spoilt .
Mrs. Norris	With quickness in understanding the tempers of those she had to deal with , and no natural timidity to restrain any consequent wishes , she was soon welcome and useful to all ; and after Fanny ’s removal succeeded so naturally to her influence over the hourly comfort of her aunt , as gradually to become , perhaps , the most beloved of the two .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his dress , Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt ’s last scene with the Baron admitted a good deal of action and emphasis , and Mr. Rushworth undertook to count his speeches .
Mrs. Norris	Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home ; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order .
Mrs. Norris	Edmund , between his theatrical and his real part , between Miss Crawford ’s claims and his own conduct , between love and consistency , was equally unobservant ; and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company , superintending their various dresses with economical expedient , for which nobody thanked her , and saving , with delighted integrity , half a crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas , to have leisure for watching the behaviour , or guarding the happiness of his daughters .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Rushworth submitted ; and the question of surveying the grounds , with the who and the how , was likely to be more fully agitated , and Mrs. Norris was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and horses most could be done , when the young people , meeting with an outward door , temptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately to turf and shrubs , and all the sweets of pleasure - grounds , as by one impulse , one wish for air and liberty , all walked out .
Mrs. Norris	The remaining three , Mrs. Rushworth , Mrs. Norris , and Julia , were still far behind ; for Julia , whose happy star no longer prevailed , was obliged to keep by the side of Mrs. Rushworth , and restrain her impatient feet to that lady ’s slow pace , while her aunt , having fallen in with the housekeeper , who was come out to feed the pheasants , was lingering behind in gossip with her .
Mrs. Norris	Fanny ’s disposition was such that she could never even think of her aunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own small house , without reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her when they had been last together ; much less could her feelings acquit her of having done and said and thought everything by William that was due to him for a whole fortnight . It was a heavy , melancholy day .
Mrs. Norris	I did not see _ that _ ; I should not know one from the other . ”
Mrs. Norris	It was only better than Mrs. Norris ’s sharp answers would have been ; but she being gone home with all the supernumerary jellies to nurse a sick maid , there was peace and good - humour in their little party , though it could not boast much beside .
Mrs. Norris	The cards were brought , and Fanny played at cribbage with her aunt till bedtime ; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself , no sounds were heard in the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the game—“And _ that _ makes thirty - one ; four in hand and eight in crib .
Mrs. Norris	But at last Lady Bertram left the room , and then almost immediately Miss Crawford thus began , with a voice as well regulated as she could—“And how do _ you _ like your cousin Edmund ’s staying away so long ?
Mrs. Norris	By the time Mrs. Price ’s answer arrived , there remained but a very few days more to be spent at Mansfield ; and for part of one of those days the young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of their journey , for when the mode of it came to be talked of , and Mrs. Norris found that all her anxiety to save her brother - in - law ’s money was vain , and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less expensive conveyance of Fanny , they were to travel post ; when she saw Sir Thomas actually give William notes for the purpose , she was struck with the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage , and suddenly seized with a strong inclination to go with them , to go and see her poor dear sister Price .
Mrs. Norris	She proclaimed her thoughts .
Mrs. Norris	She must say that she had more than half a mind to go with the young people ; it would be such an indulgence to her ; she had not seen her poor dear sister Price for more than twenty years ; and it would be a help to the young people in their journey to have her older head to manage for
Mrs. Norris	she could not help thinking her poor dear sister Price would feel it very unkind of her not to come by such an opportunity . William and Fanny were horror - struck at the idea .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris was left to settle the matter by herself ; and it ended , to the infinite joy of her nephew and niece , in the recollection
Mrs. Norris	that she could not possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present ; that she was a great deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram for her to be able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a week , and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to that of being useful to them .
Mrs. Norris	It had , in fact , occurred to her , that though taken to Portsmouth for nothing , it would be hardly possible for her to avoid paying her own expenses back again .
Mrs. Norris	So her poor dear sister Price was left to all the disappointment of her missing such an opportunity , and another twenty years ’ absence , perhaps , begun . Edmund ’s plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey , this absence of Fanny ’s .
Mrs. Norris	She entertains me ; and she is so extremely pretty , that I have great pleasure in looking at her .
Mrs. Norris	I was quite astonished .
Mrs. Norris	I could not have believed it !
Mrs. Norris	“ I thought you would be struck .
Mrs. Norris	“ And very ungrateful , I think . ”
Mrs. Norris	I do not know that her uncle has any claim to her _ gratitude _ ; his wife certainly had ; and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt ’s memory which misleads her here .
Mrs. Norris	I do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements , though the Admiral ’s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife ; but it is natural and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely .
Mrs. Norris	I do not censure her _ opinions _ ; but there certainly _ is _ impropriety in making them public . ”
Mrs. Norris	I am glad you saw it all as I did .
Mrs. Norris	Without studying the business , however , or knowing what he was about , Edmund was beginning , at the end of a week of such intercourse , to be a good deal in love ; and to the credit of the lady it may be added that , without his being a man of the world or an elder brother , without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk , he began to be agreeable to her .
Mrs. Norris	She felt it to be so , though she had not foreseen , and could hardly understand it ; for he was not pleasant by any common rule : he talked no nonsense ; he paid no compliments ; his opinions were unbending , his attentions tranquil and simple .
Mrs. Norris	There was a charm , perhaps , in his sincerity , his steadiness , his integrity , which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel , though not equal to discuss with herself .
Mrs. Norris	She did not think very much about it , however : he pleased her for the present ; she liked to have him near her ; it was enough .
Mrs. Norris	Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning ; she would gladly have been there too , might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed , to hear the harp ; neither could she wonder that , when the evening stroll was over , and the two families parted again , he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home , while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park ; but she thought it a very bad exchange ; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and water for her , would rather go without it than not .
Mrs. Norris	She was a little surprised that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford , and not see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed , and of which _ she _ was almost always reminded by a something of the same nature whenever she was in her company ; but so it was .
Mrs. Norris	Edmund was fond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford , but he seemed to think it enough that the Admiral had since been spared ; and she scrupled to point out her own remarks to him , lest it should appear like ill - nature .
Mrs. Norris	The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride , which the former caught , soon after her being settled at Mansfield , from the example of the young ladies at the Park , and which , when Edmund ’s acquaintance with her increased , led to his encouraging the wish , and the offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts , as the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish .
Mrs. Norris	No pain , no injury , however , was designed by him to his cousin in this offer : _ she _ was not to lose a day ’s exercise by it .
Mrs. Norris	The mare was only to be taken down to the Parsonage half an hour before her ride were to begin ; and Fanny , on its being first proposed , so far from feeling slighted , was almost over - powered with gratitude that he should be asking her leave for it .
Mrs. Norris	Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself , and no inconvenience to Fanny .
Mrs. Norris	returned with it in excellent time , before either Fanny or the steady old coachman , who always attended her when she rode without her cousins , were ready to set forward .
Mrs. Norris	Fanny was ready and waiting , and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone , and still no horse was announced , no Edmund appeared .
Mrs. Norris	To avoid her aunt , and look for him , she went out .
Mrs. Norris	The houses , though scarcely half a mile apart , were not within sight of each other ; but , by walking fifty yards from the hall door , she could look down the park , and command a view of the Parsonage and all its demesnes , gently rising beyond the village road ; and in Dr. Grant ’s meadow she immediately saw the group — Edmund and Miss Crawford both on horse - back , riding side by side , Dr. and Mrs. Grant , and Mr. Crawford , with two or three grooms , standing about and looking on .
Mrs. Norris	A happy party it appeared to her , all interested in one object : cheerful beyond a doubt , for the sound of merriment ascended even to her .
Mrs. Norris	It was a sound which did not make _ her _ cheerful ; she wondered that Edmund should forget her , and felt a pang .
Mrs. Norris	She could not turn her eyes from the meadow ; she could not help watching all that passed .
Mrs. Norris	At first Miss Crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field , which was not small , at a foot ’s pace ; then , at _ her _ apparent suggestion , they rose into a canter ; and to Fanny ’s timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well she sat .
Mrs. Norris	Edmund was close to her ; he was speaking to her ; he was evidently directing her management of the bridle ; he had hold of her hand ; she saw it , or the imagination supplied what the eye could not reach .
Mrs. Norris	She must not wonder at all this ; what could be more natural than that Edmund should be making himself useful , and proving his good - nature by any one ?
Mrs. Norris	She could not but think , indeed , that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved him the trouble ; that it would have been particularly proper and becoming in a brother to have done it himself ; but Mr. Crawford , with all his boasted good - nature , and all his coachmanship , probably knew nothing of the matter , and had no active kindness in comparison of Edmund .
Mrs. Norris	She began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such double duty ; if she were forgotten , the poor mare should be remembered .
Mrs. Norris	Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by seeing the party in the meadow disperse , and Miss Crawford still on horseback , but attended by Edmund on foot , pass through a gate into the lane , and so into the park , and make towards the spot where she stood .
Mrs. Norris	She began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient ; and walked to meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion .
Mrs. Norris	“ My dear Miss Price , ” said Miss Crawford , as soon as she was at all within hearing , “ I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting ; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself — I knew it was very late , and that I was behaving extremely ill ; and therefore , if you please , you must forgive me .
Mrs. Norris	” “ No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse , I assure you , ” said she , as she sprang down with his help
Mrs. Norris	; “ I am very strong .
Mrs. Norris	Nothing ever fatigues me but doing what I do not like .
Mrs. Norris	Miss Price , I give way to you with a very bad grace ; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride , and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear , delightful , beautiful animal . ”
Mrs. Norris	The old coachman , who had been waiting about with his own horse , now joining them , Fanny was lifted on hers , and they set off across another part of the park ; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing , as she looked back , that the others were walking down the hill together to the village ; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments on Miss Crawford ’s great cleverness as a horse - woman , which he had been watching with an interest almost equal to her own .
Mrs. Norris	Edmund and Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage , and _ she _ was excluded .
Mrs. Norris	It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant , with perfect good - humour , on Mr. Rushworth ’s account , who was partly expected at the Park that day ; but it was felt as a very grievous injury , and her good manners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home .
Mrs. Norris	As Mr. Rushworth did _ not _ come , the injury was increased , and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him ; she could only be sullen to her mother , aunt , and cousin , and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert .
Mrs. Norris	Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing - room , fresh with the evening air , glowing and cheerful , the very reverse of what they found in the three ladies sitting there , for Maria would scarcely raise her eyes from her book , and Lady Bertram was half - asleep ; and even Mrs. Norris , discomposed by her niece ’s ill - humour , and having asked one or two questions about the dinner , which were not immediately attended to , seemed almost determined to say no more .
Mrs. Norris	For a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in their praise of the night and their remarks on the stars , to think beyond themselves ; but when the first pause came , Edmund , looking around , said , “ But where is Fanny ?
Mrs. Norris	“ No , not that I know of , ” replied Mrs. Norris ; “ she was here a moment ago . ” Her own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room , which was a very long one , told them that she was on the sofa .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris began scolding .
Mrs. Norris	If you have no work of your own , I can supply you from the poor basket .
Mrs. Norris	I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out .
Mrs. Norris	You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa . ” Before half this was said , Fanny was returned to her seat at the table , and had taken up her work again ; and Julia , who was in high good - humour , from the pleasures of the day , did her the justice of exclaiming , “ I must say , ma’am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . ” “ Fanny , ” said Edmund , after looking at her attentively , “ I am sure you have the headache . ” She could not deny it , but said it was not very bad . “ I can hardly believe you , ” he replied ; “ I know your looks too well .
Mrs. Norris	to be sure she did , ” said Mrs. Norris : “ would you have her stay within such a fine day as this ?
Mrs. Norris	“ Yes , indeed , Edmund , ” added her ladyship , who had been thoroughly awakened by Mrs. Norris ’s sharp reprimand to Fanny ; “ I was out above an hour .
Mrs. Norris	I sat three - quarters of an hour in the flower - garden , while Fanny cut the roses ; and very pleasant it was , I assure you , but very hot .
Mrs. Norris	It was shady enough in the alcove , but I declare I quite dreaded the coming home again . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ There was no help for it , certainly , ” rejoined Mrs. Norris , in a rather softened voice ; “ but I question whether her headache might not be caught _ then _ , sister .
Mrs. Norris	There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun ; but I dare say it will be well to - morrow .
Mrs. Norris	Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar ; I always forget to have mine filled . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ She has got it , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time . ” “ What ! ” cried Edmund ; “ has she been walking as well as cutting roses ; walking across the hot park to your house , and doing it twice , ma’am ?
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris was talking to Julia , and did not hear .
Mrs. Norris	“ I was afraid it would be too much for her , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ but when the roses were gathered , your aunt wished to have them , and then you know they must be taken home
Mrs. Norris	Upon my word , ma’am , it has been a very ill - managed business . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better , ” cried Mrs. Norris , unable to be longer deaf ; “ unless I had gone myself , indeed ; but I can not be in two places at once ; and I was talking to Mr. Green at that very time about your mother ’s dairymaid , by _ her _ desire , and had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son , and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour .
Mrs. Norris	I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion , but really I can not do everything at once .
Mrs. Norris	And as for Fanny ’s just stepping down to my house for me — it is not much above a quarter of a mile — I can not think I was unreasonable to ask it .
Mrs. Norris	How often do I pace it three times a day , early and late , ay , and in all weathers too , and say nothing about it ?
Mrs. Norris	” “ I wish Fanny had half your strength , ma’am . ” “ If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise , she would not be knocked up so soon .
Mrs. Norris	She has not been out on horseback now this long while , and I am persuaded that , when she does not ride , she ought to walk .
Mrs. Norris	If she had been riding before , I should not have asked it of her .
Mrs. Norris	But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses ; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind ; and though the sun was strong , it was not so very hot .
Mrs. Norris	Between ourselves , Edmund , ” nodding significantly at his mother , “ it was cutting the roses , and dawdling about in the flower - garden , that did the mischief . ” “ I am afraid it was , indeed , ” said the more candid Lady Bertram ,
Mrs. Norris	who had overheard her
Mrs. Norris	; “ I am very much afraid she caught the headache there , for the heat was enough to kill anybody .
Mrs. Norris	It was as much as I could bear myself .
Mrs. Norris	, was almost too much for me .
Mrs. Norris	Here are many that would be interested in your improvements , my dear Mr. Rushworth , and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford ’s opinion on the spot , and that might be of some small use to you with _ their _ opinions ; and , for my own part , I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again ; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss ; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth , while the rest of you walked about and settled things , and
Mrs. Norris	then we could all return to a late dinner here , or dine at Sotherton , just as might be most agreeable to your mother , and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight .
Mrs. Norris	I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche , and Edmund can go on horseback , you know , sister , and Fanny will stay at home with you .
Mrs. Norris	Lady Bertram made no objection ; and every one concerned in the going was forward in expressing their ready concurrence , excepting Edmund , who heard it all and said nothing .
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving it would be to Sir Thomas as with any part of it .
Mrs. Norris	“ _ Now _ William would be able to keep himself , which would make a vast difference to his uncle , for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle ; and , indeed , it would make some difference in _ her _ presents too .
Mrs. Norris	She was very glad that she had given William what she did at parting , very glad , indeed , that it had been in her power , without material inconvenience , just at that time to give him something rather considerable ; that is , for _ her _ , with _ her _ limited means , for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin .
Mrs. Norris	She knew he must be at some expense , that he would have many things to buy , though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap ; but she was very glad she had contributed her mite towards it .
Mrs. Norris	” “ I am glad you gave him something considerable , ” said Lady Bertram , with most unsuspicious calmness , “ for _ I _ gave him only £ 10 . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Indeed ! ” cried Mrs. Norris , reddening .
Mrs. Norris	“ Upon my word , he must have gone off with his pockets well lined , and at no expense for his journey to London either ! ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Sir Thomas told me £ 10 would be enough . ”
Mrs. Norris	Mrs. Norris , being not at all inclined to question its sufficiency , began to take the matter in another point .
Mrs. Norris	“ It is amazing , ” said she , “ how much young people cost their friends , what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world !
Mrs. Norris	Now , here are my sister Price ’s children ; take them all together , I dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year , to say nothing of what _ I _ do for them .
Mrs. Norris	Fanny , William must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies ; and I shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having .
Mrs. Norris	I wish he may go to the East Indies , that I may have my shawl .
Mrs. Norris	I think I will have two shawls , Fanny . ”
Mrs. Norris	She fancied he was trying for it the whole evening at intervals , whenever Sir Thomas was out of the room , or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris , and she carefully refused him every opportunity .
Mr. Rushworth	I then saw him behaving , as it appeared to me , so very improperly and unfeelingly — I may speak of it now because it is all over — so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth , not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him , and paying attentions to my cousin Maria , which — in short , at the time of the play , I received an impression which will never be got over .
Mr. Rushworth	” “ As a bystander , ” said Fanny , “ perhaps I saw more than you did ; and I do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous . ”
Mr. Rushworth	Miss Crawford accepted the part very readily ; and soon after Miss Bertram ’s return from the Parsonage , Mr. Rushworth arrived , and another character was consequently cast .
Mr. Rushworth	He had the offer of Count Cassel and Anhalt , and at first did not know which to chuse , and wanted Miss Bertram to direct him ; but upon being made to understand the different style of the characters , and which was which , and recollecting that he had once seen the play in London , and had thought Anhalt a very stupid fellow , he soon decided for the Count .
Mr. Rushworth	Miss Bertram approved the decision , for the less he had to learn the better ; and though she could not sympathise in his wish that the Count and Agatha might be to act together , nor wait very patiently while he was slowly turning over the
Mr. Rushworth	, she very kindly took his part in hand , and curtailed every speech that admitted being shortened ; besides pointing out the necessity of his being very much dressed , and chusing his colours .
Mr. Rushworth	Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well , though affecting to despise it ; and was too much engaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others , or draw any of those conclusions , or feel any of that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for . Thus much was settled before Edmund , who had been out all the morning , knew anything of the matter ; but when he entered the drawing - room before dinner , the buzz of discussion was high between Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates ; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him the agreeable news .
Mr. Rushworth	“ We have got a play , ” said he .
Mr. Rushworth	“ It is to be Lovers ’ Vows ; and I am to be Count Cassel , and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak , and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit , by way of a shooting - dress .
Mr. Rushworth	I do not know how I shall like it . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ Lovers ’ Vows ! ” in a tone of the greatest amazement , was his only reply to Mr. Rushworth , and he turned towards his brother and sisters as if hardly doubting a contradiction .
Mr. Rushworth	Mr. Rushworth followed him to say , “ I come in three times , and have two - and - forty speeches .
Mr. Rushworth	But I do not much like the idea of being so fine .
Mr. Rushworth	I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak . ”
Mr. Rushworth	Edmund could not answer him .
Mr. Rushworth	In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter ; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates , and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth , Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying , “ I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up .
Mr. Rushworth	I can not but suppose you _ will _ when you have read it carefully over .
Mr. Rushworth	It will not be necessary to send you to your _ father ’s _ judgment , I am convinced . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ I am sorry for it , ” was his answer ; “ but in this matter it is _ you _ who are to lead .
Mr. Rushworth	“ Do you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head ?
Mr. Rushworth	No ; you must excuse me ; I can not retract my consent ; it is too far settled , everybody would be so disappointed , Tom would be quite angry ; and if we are so very nice , we shall never act anything . ”
Mr. Rushworth	As Mr. Rushworth is to act too , there can be no harm .
Mr. Rushworth	, found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company ; and Mr. Rushworth , having only his own part and his own dress in his head , had soon talked away all that could be said of either . But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two : there was still a great deal to be settled ; and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage , Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates , soon after their being reassembled in the drawing - room , seated themselves in committee at a separate table , with the play open before them , and were just getting deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford , who , late and dark and dirty as it was , could not help coming , and were received with the most grateful joy . “ Well , how do you go on ? ” and “ What have you settled ? ” and “ Oh ! we can do nothing without you , ” followed the first salutations ; and Henry Crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table , while his sister made her way to Lady Bertram , and with pleasant attention was complimenting _ her _ .
Mr. Rushworth	“ I had my choice of the parts , ” said Mr. Rushworth ; “ but I thought I should like the Count best , though I do not much relish the finery I am to have . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ You chose very wisely , I am sure , ” replied Miss Crawford , with a brightened look ; “ Anhalt is a heavy part . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ _ The _ _ Count _ has two - and - forty speeches , ” returned Mr. Rushworth , “ which is no trifle . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ _ That _ circumstance would by no means tempt me , ” he replied , “ for I should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting .
Mr. Rushworth	It need not frighten you : it is a nothing of a part , a mere nothing , not above half a dozen speeches altogether , and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say ; so you may be as creep - mouse as you like , but we must have you to look at . ” “ If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches , ” cried Mr. Rushworth , “ what would you do with such a part as mine ?
Mr. Rushworth	I have forty - two to learn .
Mr. Rushworth	You have only two scenes , and as I shall be Cottager , I ’ll put you in and push you about , and you will do it very well , I ’ll answer for it .
Mr. Rushworth	While he spoke , Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in full expectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as this : so contrary to all their first protestations ; but Edmund said nothing .
Mr. Rushworth	The Rushworths were the only addition to his own domestic circle which he could solicit .
Mr. Rushworth	Edmund did not wonder that such should be his father ’s feelings , nor could he regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants .
Mr. Rushworth	They seem to belong to us ; they
Mr. Rushworth	I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected .
Mr. Rushworth	They had not been here a twelvemonth when he left England .
Mr. Rushworth	I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr. Rushworth . ”
Mr. Rushworth	He must like him less after to - morrow ’s visit , for we shall be five hours in his company .
Mr. Rushworth	I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . ” In this quarter , indeed , disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas .
Mr. Rushworth	Not all his good - will for Mr. Rushworth , not all Mr. Rushworth ’s deference for him , could prevent him from soon discerning some part of the truth — that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man , as ignorant in business as in books , with opinions in general unfixed , and without seeming much aware of it himself .
Mr. Rushworth	Her behaviour to Mr. Rushworth was careless and cold .
Mr. Rushworth	She could not , did not like him .
Mr. Rushworth	Mr. Rushworth had , perhaps , been accepted on too short an acquaintance , and , on knowing him better , she was repenting .
Mr. Rushworth	She had the highest esteem for Mr. Rushworth ’s character and disposition , and could not have a doubt of her happiness with him .
Mr. Rushworth	Mr. Rushworth was young enough to improve .
Mr. Rushworth	Mr. Rushworth must and would improve in good society ; and if Maria could now speak so securely of her happiness with him , speaking certainly without the prejudice , the blindness of love , she ought to be believed .
Mr. Rushworth	Her feelings , probably , were not acute ; he had never supposed them to be so ; but her comforts might not be less on that account ; and if she could dispense with seeing her husband a leading , shining character
Mr. Rushworth	She was in a state of mind to be glad that she had secured her fate beyond recall : that she had pledged herself anew to Sotherton ; that she was safe from the possibility of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her actions , and destroying her prospects ; and retired in proud resolve , determined only to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth in future , that her father might not be again suspecting her .
Mr. Rushworth	Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four days after Henry Crawford ’s leaving Mansfield , before her feelings were at all tranquillised , before she had given up every hope of him , or absolutely resolved on enduring his rival , her answer might have been different ; but after another three or four days , when there was no return , no letter , no message , no symptom of a softened heart , no hope of advantage from separation , her mind became cool enough to seek all the comfort that pride and self revenge could give .
Mr. Rushworth	Henry Crawford had destroyed her happiness , but he should not know that he had done it ; he should not destroy her credit , her appearance , her prosperity , too .
Mr. Rushworth	He should not have to think of her as pining in the retirement of Mansfield for _ him _ , rejecting Sotherton and London , independence and splendour , for _ his _ sake .
Mr. Rushworth	To such feelings delay , even the delay of much preparation , would have been an evil , and Mr. Rushworth could hardly be more impatient for the marriage than herself .
Mr. Rushworth	Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire , and make way for the fortunate young woman whom her dear son had selected ; and very early in November removed herself , her maid , her footman , and her chariot , with true dowager propriety , to Bath , there to parade over the wonders of Sotherton in her evening parties ; enjoying them as thoroughly , perhaps , in the animation of a card - table , as she had ever done on the spot ; and before the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which gave Sotherton another mistress .
Mr. Rushworth	Nothing could be objected to when it came under the discussion of the neighbourhood , except that the carriage which conveyed the bride and bridegroom and Julia from the church - door to Sotherton was the same chaise which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelvemonth before .
Mr. Rushworth	Mrs. Norris , most happy to assist in the duties of the day , by spending it at the Park to support her sister ’s spirits , and drinking the health of Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth in a supernumerary glass or two , was all joyous delight ; for she had made the match ; she had done everything ; and no one would have supposed , from her confident triumph , that she had ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her life , or could have the
Mr. Rushworth	Some other companion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first consequence to his lady ; and Julia was quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as Maria , though she might not have struggled through so much to obtain them , and could better bear a subordinate situation .
Mr. Rushworth	“ Poor Rushworth and his two - and - forty speeches ! ” continued Crawford .
Mr. Rushworth	Poor fellow !
Mr. Rushworth	I see him now — his toil and his despair .
Mr. Rushworth	Well , I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two - and - forty speeches to her ” ; adding , with a momentary seriousness , “ She is too good for him — much too good . ”
Mr. Rushworth	It was much pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father ; and to think of their father in England again within a certain period , which these letters obliged them to do , was a most unwelcome exercise .
Mr. Rushworth	November was the black month fixed for his return .
Mr. Rushworth	Sir Thomas wrote of it with as much decision as experience and anxiety could authorise .
Mr. Rushworth	His business was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take his passage in the September packet , and he consequently looked forward with the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November .
Mr. Rushworth	Sir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half that his daughters felt on the subject of his return , and would hardly have found consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in the breast of another young lady .
Mr. Rushworth	after tea , as Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight scene , while the Miss Bertrams , Mr. Rushworth , and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte , she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group , and saying , “ How happy Mr. Rushworth looks !
Mr. Rushworth	He is thinking of November . ”
Mr. Rushworth	Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too , but had nothing to say .
Mr. Rushworth	Nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best , or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear . ” “ No , my dear Miss Price , and for reasons good .
Mr. Rushworth	It is indolence , Mr. Bertram , indeed .
Mr. Rushworth	“ I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle , ” said Miss Crawford , “ that I can hardly suppose — and since you push me so hard , I must observe , that I am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are , being at this present time the guest of my own brother , Dr. Grant .
Mr. Rushworth	And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me , and though he is really a gentleman , and , I dare say , a good scholar and clever , and often preaches good sermons , and is very respectable , _ I _ see him to be an indolent , selfish _ bon _ _ vivant _ , who must have his palate consulted in everything ; who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one ; and who , moreover , if the cook makes a blunder , is out of humour with his excellent wife .
Mr. Rushworth	To own the truth , Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose , which he could not get the better of .
Mr. Rushworth	We can not attempt to defend Dr. Grant . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ No , ” replied Fanny , “ but we need not give up his profession for all that ; because , whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen , he would have taken a — not a good temper into it ; and as he must , either in the navy or army , have had a great many more people under his command than he has now , I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman .
Mr. Rushworth	Besides , I can not but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession , where he would have had less time and obligation — where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself , the _ frequency _ , at least , of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now .
Mr. Rushworth	A man — a sensible man like Dr. Grant , can not be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week , can not go to church twice every Sunday , and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does , without being the better for it himself .
Mr. Rushworth	“ We will stay till this is finished , Fanny , ” said he , turning his back on the window ; and as it advanced , she had the mortification of seeing him advance too , moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument , and when it ceased , he was close by the singers , among the most urgent in requesting to hear the glee again .
Mr. Rushworth	Mr. Rushworth was worked on .
Mr. Rushworth	“ Well , ” said he , “ if you really think I had better go : it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing . ”
Mr. Rushworth	And letting himself out , he walked off without farther ceremony .
Mr. Rushworth	It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came in , and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially agreeable , or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the object of the day .
Mr. Rushworth	She felt , as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth , that hers was not the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them : there was gloom on the face of each .
Mr. Rushworth	Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more gay , and she thought that he was taking particular pains , during dinner , to do away any little resentment of the other two , and restore general good - humour .
Mr. Rushworth	, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage came to the door , and Mrs. Norris , having fidgeted about , and obtained a few pheasants ’ eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper , and made abundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth , was ready to lead the way .
Mr. Rushworth	At the same moment Mr. Crawford , approaching Julia , said , “ I hope I am not to lose my companion , unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat . ” The request had not been foreseen , but was very graciously received , and Julia ’s day was likely to end almost as well as it began .
Mr. Rushworth	He was certainly better pleased to hand her into the barouche than to assist her in ascending the box , and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement .
Mr. Rushworth	“ What else have you been spunging ? ” said Maria , half - pleased that Sotherton should be so complimented .
Mr. Rushworth	Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations , and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man .
Mr. Rushworth	They are at Brighton now , you know ; in one of the best houses there , as Mr. Rushworth ’s fine fortune gives them a right to be .
Mr. Rushworth	Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might depend on , when she was stopped by Sir Thomas ’s saying with authority , “ I do not advise your going to Brighton , William , as I trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting ; but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere ; and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own .
Mr. Rushworth	“ I would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than anything else , ” was William ’s only answer , in an undervoice , not meant to reach far , and the subject dropped .
Mr. Rushworth	Mr. Yates might consider it only as a vexatious interruption for the evening , and Mr. Rushworth might imagine it a blessing ; but every other heart was
Mr. Rushworth	They walked off , utterly heedless of Mr. Rushworth ’s repeated question of , “ Shall I go too ?
Mr. Rushworth	Had not I better go too ?
Mr. Rushworth	Will not it be right for me to go too ? ”
Mr. Rushworth	were no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer the anxious inquiry , and , encouraging him by all means to pay his respects to Sir Thomas without delay , sent him after the others with delighted haste . Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates .
Mr. Rushworth	Mr. Rushworth was not forgotten : a most friendly reception and warmth of hand - shaking had already met him , and with pointed attention he was now included in
Mr. Rushworth	There was nothing disagreeable in Mr. Rushworth ’s appearance , and Sir Thomas was liking him already .
Mr. Rushworth	By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken , unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife , who was really extremely happy to see him , and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years .
Mr. Rushworth	She had been _ almost _ fluttered for a few minutes , and still remained so sensibly animated as to put away her work , move Pug from her side , and give all her attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband .
Mr. Rushworth	She had no anxieties for anybody to cloud _ her _ pleasure : her own time had been irreproachably spent during his absence : she had done a great deal of carpet - work , and made many yards of fringe ; and she would have answered as freely for the good conduct and useful pursuits of all the young people as for her own .
Mr. Rushworth	Not that _ she _ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas ’s disapprobation when the present state of his house should be known , for her judgment had been so blinded that , except by the instinctive caution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth ’s pink satin cloak as her brother - in - law entered , she could hardly be said to shew any sign of alarm ; but she was vexed by the _ manner _ of his return .
Mr. Rushworth	Not that _ she _ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas ’s disapprobation when the present state of his house should be known , for her judgment had been so blinded that , except by the instinctive caution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth ’s pink satin cloak as her brother - in - law entered , she could hardly be said to shew any sign of alarm ; but she was vexed by the _ manner _ of his return .
Mr. Rushworth	And with a relenting smile , he added , “ I come home to be happy and indulgent . ”
Mr. Rushworth	, he tranquilly said , “ Mr. and Miss Crawford were mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield .
Mr. Rushworth	Mr. Rushworth could be silent no longer .
Mr. Rushworth	“ I do not say he is not gentleman - like , considering ; but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight , or he will be expecting a well - looking man . ”
Mr. Rushworth	Sir Thomas did not quite understand this , and looked with some surprise at the speaker .
Mr. Rushworth	“ If I must say what I think , ” continued Mr. Rushworth , “ in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing .
Mr. Rushworth	I am not so fond of acting as I was at first .
Mr. Rushworth	I think we are a great deal better employed , sitting comfortably here among ourselves , and doing nothing . ”
Mr. Rushworth	Sir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth ’s opinion in better words than he could find himself .
Mr. Rushworth	He was aware that he must not expect a genius in Mr. Rushworth ; but as a well - judging , steady young man , with better notions than his elocution would do justice to , he intended to value him very highly .
Mr. Rushworth	Mr. Rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning ; but by looking , as he really felt , most exceedingly pleased with Sir Thomas ’s good opinion , and saying scarcely anything , he did his best towards preserving that good opinion a little longer .
Mr. Rushworth	Think of Mr. Rushworth ! ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth .
Mr. Rushworth	I often think of Mr. Rushworth ’s property and independence , and wish them in other hands ; but I never think of him .
Mr. Rushworth	, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . ” “ I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth ’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . ” “ If you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . ”
Mr. Rushworth	The sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become her greatest enemy : they were alienated from each other ; and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the attentions which were still carrying on there , some punishment to Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr. Rushworth .
Mr. Rushworth	Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning ; she would gladly have been there too , might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed , to hear the harp ; neither could she wonder that , when the evening stroll was over , and the two families parted again , he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home , while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park ; but she thought it a very bad exchange ; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and water for her , would rather go without it than not .
Mr. Rushworth	She could not but think , indeed , that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved him the trouble ; that it would have been particularly proper and becoming in a brother to have done it himself ; but Mr. Crawford , with all his boasted good - nature , and all his coachmanship , probably knew nothing of the matter , and had no active kindness in comparison of Edmund .
Mr. Rushworth	It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant , with perfect good - humour , on Mr. Rushworth ’s account , who was partly expected at the Park that day ; but it was felt as a very grievous injury , and her good manners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home .
Mr. Rushworth	As Mr. Rushworth did _ not _ come , the injury was increased , and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him ; she could only be sullen to her mother , aunt , and cousin , and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert .
Mr. Rushworth	Here are many that would be interested in your improvements , my dear Mr. Rushworth , and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford ’s opinion on the spot , and that might be of some small use to you with _ their _ opinions ; and , for my own part , I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again ; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss ; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth , while the rest of you walked about and settled things , and
Mr. Rushworth	I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche , and Edmund can go on horseback , you know , sister , and Fanny will stay at home with you .
Mr. Rushworth	Her brother was not handsome : no , when they first saw him he was absolutely plain , black and plain ; but still he was the gentleman , with a pleasing address .
Mr. Rushworth	The second meeting proved him not so very plain : he was plain , to be sure , but then he had so much countenance , and his teeth were so good , and he was so well made , that one soon forgot he was plain ; and after a third interview , after dining in company with him at the Parsonage , he was no longer allowed to be called so by anybody .
Mr. Rushworth	He was , in fact , the most agreeable young man the sisters had ever known , and they were equally delighted with him .
Mr. Rushworth	Miss Bertram ’s engagement made him in equity the property of Julia , of which Julia was fully aware ; and before he had been at Mansfield a week , she was quite ready to be fallen in love with .
Mr. Rushworth	“ There could be no harm in her liking an agreeable man — everybody knew her situation — Mr. Crawford must take care of himself . ”
Mr. Rushworth	Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger !
Mr. Rushworth	the Miss Bertrams were worth pleasing , and were ready to be pleased ; and he began with no object but of making them like him .
Mr. Rushworth	He did not want them to die of love ; but with sense and temper which ought to have made him judge and feel better
Mr. Rushworth	, he allowed himself great latitude on such points . “ I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly , sister , ” said he , as he returned from attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit ; “ they are very elegant , agreeable girls . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ I shall not talk to you , Henry , but I know you _ will _ like her best at last . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ Do not I tell you that I like her best _ at _ _ first _ ? ”
Mr. Rushworth	Remember that , my dear brother .
Mr. Rushworth	“ Why , as to that , Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man , and it is a great match for her . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him ; _ that _ is your opinion of your intimate friend .
Mr. Rushworth	I am sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth .
Mr. Rushworth	I could see it in her eyes , when he was mentioned .
Mr. Rushworth	“ Mary , how shall we manage him ? ” “ We must leave him to himself , I believe .
Mr. Rushworth	He will
Mr. Rushworth	“ But I would not have him _ taken _ _ in _ ; I would not have him duped ; I would have it all fair and honourable . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ Oh dear ! let him stand his chance and be taken in .
Mr. Rushworth	“ You are as bad as your brother , Mary ; but we will cure you both .
Mr. Rushworth	Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home , and Henry equally ready to lengthen his visit .
Mr. Rushworth	He had come , intending to spend only a few days with them ; but Mansfield promised well , and there was
Mr. Rushworth	nothing to call him elsewhere .
Mr. Rushworth	It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both with her , and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so : a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society to an indolent , stay - at - home man ; and Mr. Crawford ’s being his guest was an excuse for drinking claret every day
Mr. Rushworth	The Miss Bertrams ’ admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than anything which Miss Crawford ’s habits made her likely to feel .
Mr. Rushworth	She looked about her with due consideration , and found almost everything in his favour : a park , a real park , five miles round , a spacious modern - built house , so well placed and well screened as to deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen ’s seats in the kingdom , and wanting only to be completely new furnished — pleasant sisters , a quiet mother , and an agreeable man himself — with the advantage of being tied up from much gaming at present by a promise to his father , and of being Sir Thomas hereafter .
Mr. Rushworth	It might do very well ; she believed she should accept him ; and she began accordingly to interest herself a little about the horse which he had to run at the B — — races .
Mr. Rushworth	These races were to call him away not long after their acquaintance began ; and as it appeared that the family did not , from his usual goings on , expect him back again for many weeks , it would bring his passion to an early proof .
Mr. Rushworth	Much was said on his side to induce her to attend the races , and schemes were made for a large party to them , with all the eagerness of inclination , but it would only do to be talked of . And Fanny , what was _ she _ doing and thinking all this while ?
Mr. Rushworth	and what was _ her _ opinion of the newcomers ? Few young ladies of eighteen could be less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny . In a quiet way , very little attended to , she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss Crawford ’s beauty ; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford very plain , in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the contrary , she never mentioned _ him _ .
Mr. Rushworth	Mr. Bertram , I dare say _ you _ have sometimes met with such changes .
Mr. Rushworth	“ I believe I have , but this is hardly fair ; I see what you are at .
Mr. Rushworth	You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson . ”
Mr. Rushworth	But I _ will _ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure , if you will tell me what about .
Mr. Rushworth	agree with you there .
Tom Bertram	Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well , though affecting to despise it ; and was too much engaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others , or draw any of those conclusions , or feel any of that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for . Thus much was settled before Edmund , who had been out all the morning , knew anything of the matter ; but when he entered the drawing - room before dinner , the buzz of discussion was high between Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates ; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him the agreeable news .
Tom Bertram	No ; you must excuse me ; I can not retract my consent ; it is too far settled , everybody would be so disappointed , Tom would be quite angry ; and if we are so very nice , we shall never act anything . ”
Tom Bertram	I only wish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began , for there was the loss of half a day ’s work about those side - doors .
Tom Bertram	I forgot to tell Tom of something that happened to me this very day .
Tom Bertram	, found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company ; and Mr. Rushworth , having only his own part and his own dress in his head , had soon talked away all that could be said of either . But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two : there was still a great deal to be settled ; and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage , Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates , soon after their being reassembled in the drawing - room , seated themselves in committee at a separate table , with the play open before them , and were just getting deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford , who , late and dark and dirty as it was , could not help coming , and were received with the most grateful joy . “ Well , how do you go on ? ” and “ What have you settled ? ” and “ Oh ! we can do nothing without you , ” followed the first salutations ; and Henry Crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table , while his sister made her way to Lady Bertram , and with pleasant attention was complimenting _ her _ .
Tom Bertram	Such a forward young lady may well frighten the men . ” “ I should be but too happy in taking the part , if it were possible , ” cried Tom ; “ but , unluckily , the Butler and Anhalt are in together .
Tom Bertram	“ Your _ brother _ should take the part , ” said Mr. Yates , in a low voice .
Tom Bertram	“ Do not you think he would ? ” “ _ I _ shall not ask him , ” replied Tom , in a cold , determined manner .
Tom Bertram	Her entreaty had no effect on Tom : he only said again what he had said before ; and it was not merely Tom , for the requisition was now backed by Maria , and Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Yates , with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious , and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny ; and before she could breathe after it , Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you !
Tom Bertram	Tom repeated his resolution of going to him early on the morrow ; and though Julia , who had scarcely opened her lips before , observed , in a sarcastic manner , and with a glance first at Maria and then at Edmund , that “ the Mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly , ” Edmund still held his peace , and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity .
Tom Bertram	In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter ; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates , and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth , Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying , “ I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up .
Tom Bertram	Mr. Edmund Bertram , as you do not act yourself , you will be a disinterested adviser ; and , therefore , I apply to _ you _ .
Tom Bertram	What is your advice ? ”
Tom Bertram	“ My advice , ” said he calmly , “ is that you change the play . ”
Tom Bertram	“ _ I _ should have no objection , ” she replied ; “ for though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported , that is , if everything went well , I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience ; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _ that _ _ table _ ” ( looking round ) , “ it certainly will not be taken . ” Edmund said no more .
Tom Bertram	“ If _ any _ part could tempt _ you _ to act , I suppose it would be Anhalt , ” observed the lady archly , after a short pause ; “ for he is a clergyman , you know .
Tom Bertram	“ Fanny , ” cried Tom Bertram , from the other table , where the conference was eagerly carrying on , and the conversation incessant , “ we want your services . ”
Tom Bertram	“ Indeed you must excuse me .
Tom Bertram	“ No , indeed , Mr. Bertram , you must excuse me .
Tom Bertram	You can not have an idea .
Tom Bertram	If I were to undertake it , I should only disappoint you . ”
Tom Bertram	” “ You must excuse me , indeed you must excuse me , ” cried Fanny , growing more and more red from excessive agitation , and looking distressfully at Edmund , who was kindly observing her ; but unwilling to exasperate his brother by interference , gave her only an encouraging smile .
Tom Bertram	Her entreaty had no effect on Tom : he only said again what he had said before ; and it was not merely Tom , for the requisition was now backed by Maria , and Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Yates , with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious , and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny ; and before she could breathe after it , Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you !
Tom Bertram	The consultation upon the play still went on , and Miss Crawford ’s attention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram ’s telling her , with infinite regret , that he found it absolutely impossible for him to undertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler : he had been most anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible , but it would not do ; he must give it up .
Tom Bertram	“ But there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling it , ” he added .
Tom Bertram	I could name , at this moment , at least six young men within six miles of us , who are wild to be admitted into our company , and there are one or two that would not disgrace us : I should not be afraid to trust either of the Olivers or Charles Maddox .
Tom Bertram	Tom Oliver is a very clever fellow , and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere , so I will take my horse early to - morrow morning and ride over to Stoke , and settle with one of them .
Tom Bertram	“ True , to see real acting , good hardened real acting ; but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade : a set of gentlemen and ladies , who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through . ” After a short pause , however , the subject still continued , and was discussed with unabated eagerness , every one ’s inclination increasing by the discussion , and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest ; and though nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy , and his sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy , and that nothing in the world could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all , the resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as to make Edmund quite uncomfortable .
Tom Bertram	Tom , returning from them into the drawing - room , where Edmund was standing thoughtfully by the fire , while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at a little distance , and Fanny close beside her arranging her work , thus began as he entered—“Such a horribly vile billiard - table as ours is not to be met with , I believe , above ground .
Tom Bertram	this wo n’t do , ” cried Tom , throwing himself into a chair with a hearty laugh .
Tom Bertram	“ To be sure , my dear mother , your anxiety — I was unlucky there . ”
Tom Bertram	“ I know all that , ” said Tom , displeased .
Tom Bertram	“ I know my father as well as you do ; and I ’ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him .
Tom Bertram	Manage your own concerns , Edmund , and I ’ll take care of the rest of the family .
Tom Bertram	” “ For everything of that nature I will be answerable , ” said Tom , in a decided tone .
Tom Bertram	Tom walked out of the room as he said it , and Edmund was left to sit down and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation .
Tom Bertram	“ I dare say she would , but she has no influence with either Tom or my sisters that could be of any use ; and if I can not convince them myself , I shall let things take their course , without attempting it through her .
Tom Bertram	” His sisters , to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next morning , were quite as impatient of his advice , quite as unyielding to his representation , quite as determined in the cause of pleasure , as Tom .
Tom Bertram	There was comfort also in Tom , who gradually regained his health , without regaining the thoughtlessness and selfishness of his previous habits .
Tom Bertram	He was the better for ever for his illness .
Tom Bertram	He had suffered , and he had learned to think : two advantages that he had never known before ; and
Tom Bertram	the self - reproach arising from the deplorable event in Wimpole Street , to which he felt himself accessory by all the dangerous intimacy of his unjustifiable theatre
Tom Bertram	, made an impression on his mind which , at the age of six - and - twenty , with no want of sense or good companions , was durable in its happy effects .
Tom Bertram	Fanny told of their departure , and delivered their message . “ Then poor Yates is all alone , ” cried Tom .
Tom Bertram	At the very moment of Yates perceiving Sir Thomas , and giving perhaps the very best start he had ever given in the whole course of his rehearsals , Tom Bertram entered at the other end of the room ; and never had he found greater difficulty in keeping his countenance .
Tom Bertram	His father ’s looks of solemnity and amazement on this his first appearance on any stage , and the gradual metamorphosis of the impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well - bred and easy Mr. Yates , making his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram , was such an exhibition , such a piece of true acting , as he would not have lost upon any account .
Tom Bertram	Tom understood his father ’s thoughts , and heartily wishing he might be always as well disposed to give them but partial expression , began to see , more clearly than he had ever done before , that there might be some ground of offence , that there might be some reason for the glance his father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room ; and that when he inquired with mild gravity after the fate of the billiard - table , he was not proceeding beyond a very allowable curiosity .
Tom Bertram	“ Perhaps , ” said Tom , “ Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now .
Tom Bertram	Perhaps you may persuade _ her _ . ” “ No , she is quite determined .
Tom Bertram	Tom was engrossed by the concerns of his theatre , and saw nothing that did not immediately relate to it .
Tom Bertram	“ Oh , cousin ! ” “ If you are against me , I ought to distrust myself , and yet — But it is absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way , riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act — no matter whom : the look of a gentleman is to be enough .
Tom Bertram	If Tom is up , I shall go to him directly and get it over , and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good - humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity .
Tom Bertram	XLV At about the week ’s end from his return to Mansfield , Tom ’s immediate danger was over , and he was so far pronounced safe as to make his mother perfectly easy ; for being now used to the sight of him in his suffering , helpless state , and hearing only the best , and never thinking beyond what she heard , with no disposition for alarm and no aptitude at a hint , Lady Bertram was the happiest subject in the world for a little medical imposition .
Tom Bertram	The fever was subdued ; the fever had been his complaint ; of course he would soon be well again .
Tom Bertram	A very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient and the sickroom in a juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram ’s sheets of paper could do .
Tom Bertram	Fanny would certainly believe him so at least , and must find that her estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared as the attendant , supporter , cheerer of a suffering brother .
Tom Bertram	“ On the subject of my last , I had actually begun a letter when called away by Tom ’s illness , but I have now changed my mind , and fear to trust the influence of friends .
Tom Bertram	When Tom is better , I shall go . ”
Tom Bertram	Tom ’s amendment was alarmingly slow .
Tom Bertram	She supposed he could not yet leave his son , but it was a cruel , a terrible delay to her .
Tom Bertram	It astonished her that Tom ’s sisters could be satisfied with remaining in London at such a time , through an illness which had now , under different degrees of danger , lasted several weeks .
Tom Bertram	Tom had gone from London with a party of young men to Newmarket , where a neglected fall and a good deal of drinking had brought on a fever ; and when the party broke up , being unable to move , had been left by himself at the house of one of these young men to the comforts of sickness and solitude , and the attendance only of servants .
Tom Bertram	Instead of being soon well enough to follow his friends , as he had then hoped , his disorder increased considerably , and it was not long before he thought so ill of himself as to be as ready as his physician to have a letter despatched to Mansfield . “ This distressing intelligence , as you may suppose , ” observed her ladyship , after giving the substance of it , “ has agitated us exceedingly , and we can not prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive for the poor invalid , whose state Sir Thomas fears may be very critical ; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother immediately , but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on this distressing occasion , as it would be too trying for me .
Tom Bertram	Tom dangerously ill , Edmund gone to attend him , and the sadly small party remaining at Mansfield , were cares to shut out every other care , or almost every other .
Tom Bertram	The sufferings which Lady Bertram did not see had little power over her fancy ; and she wrote very comfortably about agitation , and anxiety , and poor invalids , till Tom was actually conveyed to Mansfield , and her own eyes had beheld his altered appearance .
Tom Bertram	“ He is just come , my dear Fanny , and is taken upstairs ; and I am so shocked to see him , that I do not know what to do .
Tom Bertram	I am sure he has been very ill .
Tom Bertram	Poor Tom !
Tom Bertram	I am quite grieved for him , and very much frightened , and so is Sir Thomas ; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me .
Tom Bertram	But Sir Thomas hopes he will be better to - morrow , and says we must consider his journey . ” The real solicitude now awakened in the maternal bosom was not soon over .
Tom Bertram	Tom ’s extreme impatience to be removed to Mansfield , and experience those comforts of home and family which had been little thought of in uninterrupted health , had probably induced his being conveyed thither too early , as a return of fever came on , and for a week he was in a more alarming state than ever .
Tom Bertram	Without any particular affection for her eldest cousin , her tenderness of heart made her feel that she could not spare him , and the purity of her principles added yet a keener solicitude , when she considered how little useful , how little self - denying his life had ( apparently ) been . Susan was her only companion and listener on this , as on more common occasions .
Tom Bertram	When really touched by affliction , her active powers had been all benumbed ; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom had received from her the smallest support or attempt at support .
Mr. Yates	Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well , though affecting to despise it ; and was too much engaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others , or draw any of those conclusions , or feel any of that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for . Thus much was settled before Edmund , who had been out all the morning , knew anything of the matter ; but when he entered the drawing - room before dinner , the buzz of discussion was high between Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates ; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him the agreeable news .
Mr. Yates	“ Yes , ” cried Mr. Yates .
Mr. Yates	My stupidity was abominable , for here we have all the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford ; and it is so useful to have anything of a model !
Mr. Yates	In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter ; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates , and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth , Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying , “ I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up .
Mr. Yates	Mr. Yates , who was trying to make himself agreeable to Julia
Mr. Yates	, found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company ; and Mr. Rushworth , having only his own part and his own dress in his head , had soon talked away all that could be said of either . But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two : there was still a great deal to be settled ; and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage , Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates , soon after their being reassembled in the drawing - room , seated themselves in committee at a separate table , with the play open before them , and were just getting deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford , who , late and dark and dirty as it was , could not help coming , and were received with the most grateful joy . “ Well , how do you go on ? ” and “ What have you settled ? ” and “ Oh ! we can do nothing without you , ” followed the first salutations ; and Henry Crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table , while his sister made her way to Lady Bertram , and with pleasant attention was complimenting _ her _ .
Mr. Yates	“ Your _ brother _ should take the part , ” said Mr. Yates , in a low voice .
Mr. Yates	“ And Mr. Yates , I presume , is not far off . ” “ Mr. Yates !
Mr. Yates	we hear nothing of Mr. Yates .
Mr. Yates	I do not imagine he figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park ; do you , Miss Price ?
Mr. Yates	I think my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her father with Mr. Yates . ”
Mr. Yates	The Honourable John Yates , this new friend , had not much to recommend him beyond habits of fashion and expense , and being the younger son of a lord with a tolerable independence ; and Sir Thomas would probably have thought his introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable .
Mr. Yates	Mr. Bertram ’s acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth , where they had spent ten days together in the same society , and the friendship , if friendship it might be called , had been proved and perfected by Mr. Yates ’s being invited to take Mansfield in his way , whenever he could , and by his promising to come ; and he did come rather earlier than had been expected , in consequence of the sudden breaking - up of a large party assembled for gaiety at the house of another friend , which he had left Weymouth to join .
Mr. Yates	He came on the wings of disappointment , and with his head full of acting , for it had been a theatrical party ; and
Mr. Yates	the play in which he had borne a part was within two days of representation , when the sudden death of one of the nearest connexions of the family had destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers .
Mr. Yates	and being so near , to lose it all , was an injury to be keenly felt , and Mr. Yates could talk of nothing else .
Mr. Yates	Ecclesford and its theatre , with its arrangements and dresses , rehearsals and jokes , was his never - failing subject , and to boast of the past his only consolation .
Mr. Yates	Happily for him , a love of the theatre is so general , an itch for acting so strong among young people , that he could hardly out - talk the interest of his hearers .
Mr. Yates	The play had been Lovers ’ Vows , and Mr. Yates was to have been Count Cassel .
Mr. Yates	“ A trifling part , ” said he , “ and not at all to my taste , and such a one as I certainly would not accept again ; but I was determined to make no difficulties .
Mr. Yates	Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two characters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford ; and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign his to me , it was impossible to take it , you know .
Mr. Yates	I was sorry for _ him _ that he should have so mistaken his powers , for he was no more equal to the Baron — a little man with a weak voice , always hoarse after the first ten minutes .
Mr. Yates	I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick .
Mr. Yates	” “ It was a hard case , upon my word ” ; and , “ I do think you were very much to be pitied , ” were the kind responses of listening sympathy .
Mr. Yates	It was but three days ; and being only a grandmother , and all happening two hundred miles off , I think there would have been no great harm , and it was suggested , I know ; but Lord Ravenshaw , who I suppose is one of the most correct men in England ,
Mr. Yates	Well , the jointure may comfort _ him _ ; and perhaps , between friends , he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the Baron , and was not sorry to withdraw ; and to make _ you _ amends , Yates , I think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield , and ask you to be our manager .
Mr. Yates	“ We must have a curtain , ” said Tom Bertram ; “ a few yards of green baize for a curtain , and perhaps that may be enough . ” “ Oh , quite enough , ” cried Mr. Yates , “ with only just a side wing or two run up , doors in flat , and three or four scenes to be let down ; nothing
Mr. Yates	Maria , Julia , Henry Crawford , and Mr. Yates were in the billiard - room .
Mr. Yates	And as to my father ’s being absent , it is so far from an objection , that I consider it rather as a motive ; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother ; and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety , and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks , I shall think our time very well spent , and so , I am sure , will he .
Mr. Yates	Mr. Yates might consider it only as a vexatious interruption for the evening , and Mr. Rushworth might imagine it a blessing ; but every other heart was
Mr. Yates	She had found a seat , where in excessive trembling she was enduring all these fearful thoughts , while the other three , no longer under any restraint , were giving vent to their feelings of vexation , lamenting over such an unlooked - for premature arrival as a most untoward event , and without mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been twice as long on his passage , or were still in Antigua . The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates , from better understanding the family , and judging more clearly of the mischief that must ensue .
Mr. Yates	The ruin of the play was to them a certainty : they felt the total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand ; while Mr. Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption , a disaster for the evening , and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal being renewed after tea , when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over , and he might be at leisure to be amused by it .
Mr. Yates	The Crawfords laughed at the idea ; and having soon agreed on the propriety of their walking quietly home and leaving the family to themselves , proposed Mr. Yates ’s accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage . But Mr. Yates , having never been with those who thought much of parental claims , or family confidence , could not perceive that anything of the kind was necessary ; and therefore , thanking them , said , “
Mr. Yates	he preferred remaining where he was , that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman handsomely since he _ was _ come ; and besides , he did not think it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away .
Mr. Yates	His father ’s looks of solemnity and amazement on this his first appearance on any stage , and the gradual metamorphosis of the impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well - bred and easy Mr. Yates , making his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram , was such an exhibition , such a piece of true acting , as he would not have lost upon any account .
Mr. Yates	It was necessary for him to step forward , too , and assist the introduction , and with many awkward sensations he did his best .
Mr. Yates	Sir Thomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which was due to his own character , but was really as far from pleased with the necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner of its commencement .
Mr. Yates	Mr. Yates ’s family and connexions were sufficiently known to him to render his introduction as the “ particular friend , ” another of the hundred particular friends of his son , exceedingly unwelcome ; and it needed all the felicity of being again at home , and all the forbearance it could supply , to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding himself thus bewildered in his own house , making part of a ridiculous exhibition in the midst of theatrical nonsense , and forced in so untoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young man whom he felt sure of disapproving , and whose easy indifference and volubility in the course of the first five minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of the two .
Mr. Yates	A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side ; and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates , as to the happiness of the arrangement , the three gentlemen returned to the drawing - room together , Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which was not lost on all
Mr. Yates	And then he would have changed the subject , and sipped his coffee in peace over domestic matters of a calmer hue ; but Mr. Yates , without discernment to catch Sir Thomas ’s meaning , or diffidence , or delicacy , or discretion enough to allow him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the others with the least obtrusiveness himself , would keep him on the topic of the theatre , would torment him with questions and remarks relative to it , and finally would make him hear the whole history of
Mr. Yates	Sir Thomas listened most politely , but found much to offend his ideas of decorum , and confirm his ill - opinion of Mr. Yates ’s habits of thinking , from the beginning to the end of the story ; and when it was over , could give him no other assurance of sympathy than what a slight bow conveyed .
Mr. Yates	Mr. Yates took the subject from his friend as soon as possible , and immediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they had done and were doing : told him of the gradual increase of their views , the happy conclusion of their first difficulties , and present promising state of affairs ; relating everything with so blind an interest as made him not only totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many of his friends as they sat , the change of countenance , the fidget , the hem ! of unquietness , but prevented him even from seeing the expression of the face on which his own eyes were fixed — from seeing Sir Thomas ’s dark brow contract as he looked with inquiring earnestness at his daughters and Edmund , dwelling particularly on the latter , and speaking a language , a remonstrance , a reproof , which _ he _ felt at his heart .
Mr. Yates	Mr. Yates was still talking .
Mr. Yates	Our company is now so dispersed , from the Crawfords being gone home , that nothing more can be done to - night ; but if you will give us the honour of your company to - morrow evening , I should not be afraid of the result .
Mr. Yates	Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his dress , Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt ’s last scene with the Baron admitted a good deal of action and emphasis , and Mr. Rushworth undertook to count his speeches .
Mr. Yates	She either sat in gloomy silence , wrapt in such gravity as nothing could subdue , no curiosity touch , no wit amuse ; or allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates , was talking with forced gaiety to him alone , and ridiculing the acting of the others .
Mr. Yates	I am sure _ Julia _ does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends
Dr. Grant	It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both with her , and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so : a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society to an indolent , stay - at - home man ; and Mr. Crawford ’s being his guest was an excuse for drinking claret every day
Dr. Grant	My mother seldom goes into company herself , and dines nowhere but with Mrs. Grant , and Fanny stays at home with _ her _ . ”
