Character	Assertion
Mrs. Jennings	and the two girls set off together . They gaily ascended the downs , rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky ; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south - westerly wind , they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations .
Mrs. Jennings	The gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . Then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by Margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither Margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour . Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression .
Mrs. Jennings	The honour was readily granted , and he then departed , to make himself still more interesting , in the midst of a heavy rain . His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration , and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.-- Marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest , for the confusion which crimsoned over her face , on his lifting her up , had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house . But she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise . His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story ; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality , there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her .
Mrs. Jennings	His name was good , his residence was in their favourite village , and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting - jacket was the most becoming .
Mrs. Jennings	"Her imagination was busy , her reflections were pleasant , and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded . Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors ; and Marianne 's accident being related to him , he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham . "" Willoughby ! "" cried Sir John ; "" what , is HE in the country ?"
Mrs. Jennings	21 The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day , and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain each other . But this did not last long ; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head , had hardly done wondering at Charlotte 's being so happy without a cause , at Mr. Palmer 's acting so simply , with good abilities , and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife , before Sir John 's and Mrs. Jennings 's active zeal in the cause of society , procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe .
Mrs. Jennings	In a morning 's excursion to Exeter , they had met with two young ladies , whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations , and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to the park , as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over . Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation , and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the return of Sir John , by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life , and of whose elegance,-- whose tolerable gentility even , she could have no proof ; for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all .
Mrs. Jennings	Their being her relations too made it so much the worse ; and Mrs. Jennings 's attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded , when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable ; because they were all cousins and must put up with one another .
Mrs. Jennings	She wished very much to have the subject continued , though she did not chuse to join in it herself ; but nothing more of it was said , and for the first time in her life , she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information , or in a disposition to communicate it .
Mrs. Jennings	Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings ,
Mrs. Jennings	They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings , who had not patience enough to wait till the door was opened before she told HER story .
Mrs. Jennings	"She came hallooing to the window , "" How do you do , my dear ?"
Mrs. Jennings	I have brought my other son and daughter to see you .
Mrs. Jennings	I thought I heard a carriage last night , while we were drinking our tea , but it never entered my head that it could be them .
Mrs. Jennings	"I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again""-- Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John ."
Mrs. Jennings	Mrs. Jennings , in the meantime , talked on as loud as she could , and continued her account of their surprise , the evening before , on seeing their friends , without ceasing till every thing was told . Mrs. Palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment , and every body agreed , two or three times over , that it had been quite an agreeable surprise .
Mrs. Jennings	""" You may believe how glad we all were to see them , "" added Mrs. Jennings , leaning forward towards Elinor , and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else , though they were seated on different sides of the room ; "" but , however , I ca n't help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation ."
Mrs. Jennings	"I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all ! """
Mrs. Jennings	41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett 's Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life .
Mrs. Jennings	Her own happiness , and her own spirits , were at least very certain ; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas .
Mrs. Jennings	So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood 's part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued .
Mrs. Jennings	As for Colonel Brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and scarcely resolved to avail herself , at Delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry .
Mrs. Jennings	It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street , and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife 's indisposition , beyond one verbal enquiry , Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation , however , which not only opposed her own inclination , but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions .
Mrs. Jennings	, was very urgent to prevent her sister 's going at all ; and Mrs. Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor 's service , so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward 's part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tete - a - tete with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike .
Mrs. Jennings	""" Very well -- and for the next presentation to a living of that value -- supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly , and likely to vacate it soon -- he might have got I dare say -- fourteen hundred pounds . And how came he not to have settled that matter before this person 's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it , but a man of Colonel Brandon 's sense!--I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common , such natural , concern!--Well , I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character . I suppose , however -- on recollection -- that the case may probably be THIS ."
Mrs. Jennings	Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation , is old enough to take it.--Aye , aye , that is the fact , depend upon it .
Mrs. Jennings	""" It is truly astonishing!""--he cried , after hearing what she said--""what could be the Colonel 's motive ? """
Mrs. Jennings	will not mention the matter to Fanny , however , for though I have broke it to her , and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear it much talked of .
Mrs. Jennings	"as to any thing else , they are both very agreeable young men : I do not know that one is superior to the other . "" Elinor said no more , and John was also for a short time silent.--His"
Mrs. Jennings	I have good reason to think -- indeed I have it from the best authority , or I should not repeat it , for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it -- but I have it from the very best authority -- not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself -- but her daughter DID , and I have it from her -- That in short , whatever objections there might be against a certain -- a certain connection -- you understand me -- it would have been far preferable to her , it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does .
Mrs. Jennings	I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light-- a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all .
Mrs. Jennings	"When Mrs. Jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared . "" Well , my dear , "" she cried , "" I sent you up to the young man ."
Mrs. Jennings	"Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty -- You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ? """
Mrs. Jennings	""" No , ma'am ; THAT was not very likely . "" "" Well , and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon that . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Two or three months ! "" cried Mrs. Jennings ; "" Lord !"
Mrs. Jennings	my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months !
Mrs. Jennings	Lord bless me!--I
Mrs. Jennings	am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars , I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him . Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already .
Mrs. Jennings	""" My dear ma'am , "" said Elinor , "" what can you be thinking of?-- Why , Colonel Brandon 's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Lord bless you , my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars ! """
Mrs. Jennings	The deception could not continue after this ; and an explanation immediately took place , by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment , without any material loss of happiness to either , for Mrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another , and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first .
Mrs. Jennings	""" Aye , aye , the parsonage is but a small one , "" said she , after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over , "" and very likely MAY be out of repair ; but to hear a man apologising , as I thought , for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground - floor , and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!-- and to you too , that had been used to live in Barton cottage!--"
Mrs. Jennings	It seems quite ridiculous . But , my dear , we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before Lucy goes to it .
Mrs. Jennings	""" "" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living 's being enough to allow them to marry . "" "" The Colonel is a ninny , my dear ; because he has two thousand a - year himself , he thinks that nobody else can marry on less . Take my word for it , that , if I am alive , I shall"
Mrs. Jennings	"I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there . "" Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more ."
Mrs. Jennings	After some opposition , Marianne yielded to her sister 's entreaties , and consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an hour .
Mrs. Jennings	When they stopped at the door , Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call ; and as she had no business at Gray 's , it was resolved , that while her young friends transacted their 's , she should pay her visit and return for them .
Mrs. Jennings	"It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , I assure you . """
Mrs. Jennings	Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother ; and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him , by the arrival of Mrs. Jennings 's servant , who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door .
Mrs. Jennings	Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs , was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage , and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day , took leave .
Mrs. Jennings	Mrs. Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her . His manners to THEM , though calm , were perfectly kind ; to Mrs. Jennings , most attentively civil ; and on Colonel Brandon 's coming in soon after himself , he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say , that he only wanted to know him to be rich , to be equally civil to HIM . After staying with them half an hour , he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street , and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton .
Mrs. Jennings	"It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park , and the flower - garden will slope down just before it , and be exceedingly pretty . We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow . "" Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself ; and was very thankful that Marianne was not present , to share the provocation . Having now said enough to make his poverty clear , and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear - rings for each of his sisters , in his next visit at Gray 's his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn , and he began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings . """
Mrs. Jennings	She seems a most valuable woman indeed -- Her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous.--Her
Mrs. Jennings	inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten.--
Mrs. Jennings	"She must have a great deal to leave . "" "" Nothing at all , I should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income ."
Mrs. Jennings	"Few people of common prudence will do THAT ; and whatever she saves , she will be able to dispose of . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ? "" "" Her daughters are both exceedingly well married , and therefore I can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther . Whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard ."
Mrs. Jennings	""" And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ? "" "" Her daughters are both exceedingly well married , and therefore I can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther . Whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard ."
Mrs. Jennings	"Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour ; and she can hardly do all this , without being aware of the expectation it raises . "" "" But she raises none in those most concerned ."
Mrs. Jennings	"I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . "" Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon ; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished , and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman , and promoting the marriage by every possible attention . He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself , to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal ; and an offer from Colonel Brandon , or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings , was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect ."
Mrs. Jennings	And Mrs. Jennings too , an exceedingly well - behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter .
Mrs. Jennings	Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with .
Mrs. Jennings	"But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both . """
Mrs. Jennings	The chance proved a lucky one , for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived , carried Mrs. Jennings away .
Mrs. Jennings	"For where she DOES dislike , I know it is most violent . "" Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph , by the door 's being thrown open , the servant 's announcing Mr. Ferrars , and Edward 's immediately walking in . It was a very awkward moment ; and the countenance of each shewed that it was so . They all looked exceedingly foolish ; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again , as to advance farther into it ."
Mrs. Jennings	But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister 's composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against Marianne inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm . A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings 's advice , of sending for the Palmers ' apothecary .
Mrs. Jennings	"He came , examined his patient , and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health , yet , by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency , and allowing the word "" infection "" to pass his lips , gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer , on her baby 's account . Mrs. Jennings , who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne 's complaint more serious than Elinor , now looked very grave on Mr. Harris 's report , and confirming Charlotte 's fears and caution , urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant ; and Mr. Palmer , though treating their apprehensions as idle , found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood ."
Mrs. Jennings	Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris 's arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer 's , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.--Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister 's account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c.
Mrs. Jennings	she urged him so strongly to remain , that he , who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance , could not long even affect to demur ; especially as Mrs. Jennings 's entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer , who seemed to feel a relief to himself , in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence .
Mrs. Jennings	Mrs. Jennings had determined very early in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it , and Colonel Brandon , who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings 's forebodings , was not in a state of mind to resist their influence .
Mrs. Jennings	Her sleep , though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it , lasted a considerable time ; and anxious to observe the result of it herself , she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it . Mrs. Jennings , knowing nothing of any change in the patient , went unusually early to bed ; her maid , who was one of the principal nurses , was recreating herself in the housekeeper 's room , and Elinor remained alone with Marianne .
Mrs. Jennings	Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne 's side , and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor 's , before Mr. Harris appeared . Her apprehensions once raised , paid by their excess for all her former security ; and the servant who sat up with her , for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called , only tortured her more , by hints of what her mistress had always thought .
Mrs. Jennings	With strong concern , and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid , did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed . Her former apprehensions , now with greater reason restored , left her no doubt of the event ; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor , her conviction of her sister 's danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope .
Mrs. Jennings	The rapid decay , the early death of a girl so young , so lovely as Marianne , must have struck a less interested person with concern . On Mrs. Jennings 's compassion she had other claims .
Mrs. Jennings	She had been for three months her companion , was still under her care , and she was known to have been greatly injured , and long unhappy .
Mrs. Jennings	The distress of her sister too , particularly a favourite , was before her;--and as for their mother , when Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to herself , her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere .
Mrs. Jennings	Mrs. Jennings , though forced , on examination , to acknowledge a temporary revival , tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;-- and Elinor , conning over every injunction of distrust , told herself likewise not to hope .
Mrs. Jennings	Marianne was in every respect materially better , and he declared her entirely out of danger . Mrs. Jennings , perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm , allowed herself to trust in his judgment , and admitted , with unfeigned joy , and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness , the probability of an entire recovery . Elinor could not be cheerful . Her joy was of a different kind , and led to any thing rather than to gaiety .
Mrs. Jennings	All within Elinor 's breast was satisfaction , silent and strong .
Mrs. Jennings	She continued by the side of her sister , with little intermission the whole afternoon , calming every fear , satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits , supplying every succour , and watching almost every look and every breath .
Mrs. Jennings	The possibility of a relapse would of course , in some moments , occur to remind her of what anxiety was-- but when she saw , on her frequent and minute examination , that every symptom of recovery continued , and saw Marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet , steady , and to all appearance comfortable , sleep , she silenced every doubt .
Mrs. Jennings	At seven o'clock , leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep , she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing - room to tea .
Mrs. Jennings	Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her , at its conclusion , to take some rest before her mother 's arrival , and allow HER to take her place by Marianne ; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue , no capability of sleep at that moment about her , and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant .
Mrs. Jennings	Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber , to satisfy herself that all continued right , left her there again to her charge and her thoughts , and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep . The night was cold and stormy .
Mrs. Jennings	All that remained to be done was to be speedy ; and , therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings 's maid with her sister , she hurried down stairs . The bustle in the vestibule , as she passed along an inner lobby , assured her that they were already in the house . She rushed to the drawing - room,--she entered it,--and saw only Willoughby .
Mrs. Jennings	"To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him?--Did you allow him to hope ? "" "" Oh !"
Mrs. Jennings	He asked me to a party , a dance at his house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there , I should have felt it too certain a thing , to trust myself near him .
Mrs. Jennings	"But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard of her illness . "" "" Last night , in Drury Lane lobby , I ran against Sir John Middleton , and when he saw who I was -- for the first time these two months -- he spoke to me.--That he had cut me ever since my marriage , I had seen without surprise or resentment . Now , however , his good - natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to -- though probably he did not think it WOULD -- vex me horridly . As bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland -- a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent -- the Palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c.--I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John . His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill - will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy ."
Mrs. Jennings	"Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight , that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her ; and , contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day , returned from that period to her own home , and her own habits , in which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share . About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street , Mrs. Jennings , on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer , entered the drawing - room , where Elinor was sitting by herself , with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful ; and giving her time only to form that idea , began directly to justify it , by saying , "" Lord !"
Mrs. Jennings	my
Mrs. Jennings	""" No , ma'am . What is it ? "" "" Something so strange !"
Mrs. Jennings	But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr. Palmer 's , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child .
Mrs. Jennings	She was sure it was very ill -- it cried , and fretted , and was all over pimples . So I looked at it directly , and , ' Lord ! my dear , ' says I , ' it is nothing in the world , but the red gum--
Mrs. Jennings	And so , just as he was going away again , it came into my head , I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it , but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news .
Mrs. Jennings	""" That is exactly what I said , my dear ."
Mrs. Jennings	' Lord ! ' says I , ' is Mrs. Dashwood ill ? '
Mrs. Jennings	So then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all I can learn , seems to be this .
Mrs. Jennings	Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ) , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There 's for you , my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it
Mrs. Jennings	' Lord ! ' thinks she to herself , ' they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ; ' and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet - work , little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord 's daughter or other , I forget who . So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride .
Mrs. Jennings	She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother 's ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing - room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . So up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for Lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on .
Mrs. Jennings	I pity HER .
Mrs. Jennings	And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit .
Mrs. Jennings	I declare , I have no patience with your sister ; and I hope , with all my heart , it will be a match in spite of her .
Mrs. Jennings	for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may . I should not wonder , if he was to be in the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same .
Mrs. Jennings	He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care .
Mrs. Jennings	I have no pity for either of them .
Mrs. Jennings	I have no notion of people 's making such a to - do about money and greatness .
Mrs. Jennings	There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a - year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . Lord !
Mrs. Jennings	"how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . "" Here Mrs. Jennings ceased , and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce . Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that Mrs. Jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of Marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it ."
Mrs. Jennings	As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject , Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion .
Mrs. Jennings	No time was to be lost in undeceiving her , in making her acquainted with the real truth , and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others , without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister , or any resentment against Edward . Elinor 's office was a painful one.--She
Mrs. Jennings	As for Lucy Steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her . She would not even admit it to have been natural ; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so , by that which only could convince her , a better knowledge of mankind . Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed.--Marianne 's feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment .
Mrs. Jennings	"The first question on her side , which led to farther particulars , was , "" How long has this been known to you , Elinor ? has he written to you ?"
Mrs. Jennings	I wish him very happy ; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty , that though now he may harbour some regret , in the end he must become so .
Mrs. Jennings	""" I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For four months , Marianne , I have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as I thought , with triumph.-- This person 's suspicions , therefore , I have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling -- surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW ."
Mrs. Jennings	attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject , with an unchanging complexion , dissented from her in nothing , and was heard
Mrs. Jennings	"""--She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another , and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward 's affection , it cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such"
Mrs. Jennings	advances towards heroism in her sister , made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself .
Mrs. Jennings	But I am sorry to relate what ensued .
Mrs. Jennings	All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement , assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments , and Fanny 's entreaties , was of no avail .
Mrs. Jennings	I never thought Edward so stubborn , so unfeeling before .
Mrs. Jennings	"He would stand to it , cost him what it might . "" "" Then , "" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity , no longer able to be silent , "" he has acted like an honest man !"
Mrs. Jennings	I beg your pardon , Mr. Dashwood , but if he had done otherwise , I should have thought him a rascal .
Mrs. Jennings	"I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . """
Mrs. Jennings	Miss Lucy Steele is , I dare say , a very deserving young woman , but in the present case you know , the connection must be impossible .
Mrs. Jennings	In short , I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for , Mrs. Jennings .
Mrs. Jennings	"We all wish her extremely happy ; and Mrs. Ferrars 's conduct throughout the whole , has been such as every conscientious , good mother , in like circumstances , would adopt . It has been dignified and liberal . Edward has drawn his own lot , and I fear it will be a bad one . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Well , sir , "" said Mrs. Jennings , "" and how did it end ? "" """
Mrs. Jennings	I am sorry to say , ma'am , in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother 's notice . He left her house yesterday , but where he is gone , or whether he is still in town , I do not know ; for WE of course can make no inquiry .
Mrs. Jennings	It is a melancholy consideration .
Mrs. Jennings	I can not conceive a situation more deplorable .
Mrs. Jennings	when to that is added the recollection , that he might , but for his own folly , within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand , five hundred a - year ( for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds , ) I can not picture to myself a more wretched condition .
Mrs. Jennings	We must all feel for him ; and the more so , because it is totally out of our power to assist him .
Mrs. Jennings	he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him .
Mrs. Jennings	"It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns . "" Elinor 's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward , though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it ."
Mrs. Jennings	I left her this morning with her lawyer , talking over the business .
Mrs. Jennings	""" "" Well ! "" said Mrs. Jennings , "" that is HER revenge ."
Mrs. Jennings	Everybody has a way of their own . But I do n't think mine would be , to make one son independent , because another had plagued me .
Mrs. Jennings	"Marianne got up and walked about the room . """
Mrs. Jennings	, he went away ; leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion , as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars 's conduct , the Dashwoods ' , and Edward 's . Marianne 's indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room ; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor , and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings , they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party .
Mrs. Jennings	At breakfast she neither ate , nor attempted to eat any thing ; and Elinor 's attention was then all employed , not in urging her , not in pitying her , nor in appearing to regard her , but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jenning 's notice entirely to herself .
Mrs. Jennings	As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings , it lasted a considerable time , and they were just setting themselves , after it , round the common working table , when a letter was delivered to Marianne , which she eagerly caught from the servant , and , turning of a death - like paleness , instantly ran out of the room .
Mrs. Jennings	"Elinor , who saw as plainly by this , as if she had seen the direction , that it must come from Willoughby , felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head , and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jenning 's notice . That good lady , however , saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking . Of Elinor 's distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as Marianne disappeared , she said , "" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature ."
Mrs. Jennings	"Elinor , though never less disposed to speak than at that moment , obliged herself to answer such an attack as this , and , therefore , trying to smile , replied , "" And have you really , Ma'am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister 's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby ?"
Mrs. Jennings	I thought it had been only a joke , but so serious a question seems to imply more ; and I must beg , therefore , that you will not deceive yourself any longer .
Mrs. Jennings	"I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married . "" "" For shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood !"
Mrs. Jennings	Mrs. Jennings laughed again , but Elinor had not spirits to say more , and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written , hurried away to their room , where , on opening the door , she saw Marianne stretched on the bed , almost choked by grief , one letter in her hand , and two or three others laying by her . Elinor drew near , but without saying a word ; and seating herself on the bed , took her hand , kissed her affectionately several times , and then gave way to a burst of tears , which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne 's .
Mrs. Jennings	Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever-- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings 's chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed .
Mrs. Jennings	Mrs. Jennings , with a thoroughly good - humoured concern for its cause , admitted the excuse most readily , and Elinor , after seeing her safe off , returned to Marianne , whom she found attempting to rise from the bed , and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor , faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food ;
Mrs. Jennings	"A glass of wine , which Elinor procured for her directly , made her more comfortable , and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness , by saying , "" Poor Elinor ! how unhappy I make you ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I only wish , "" replied her sister , "" there were any thing I COULD do , which might be of comfort to you . "" This , as every thing else would have been , was too much for Marianne , who could only exclaim , in the anguish of her heart , "" Oh !"
Mrs. Jennings	Think of your mother ; think of her misery while YOU suffer : for her sake you must exert yourself .
Mrs. Jennings	"if you knew!--And can you believe me to be so , while I see you so wretched ! "" "" Forgive me , forgive me , "" throwing her arms round her sister 's neck ; "" I know you feel for me ; I know what a heart you have ; but yet you are -- you must be happy ; Edward loves you -- what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ? "" "" Many , many circumstances , "" said Elinor , solemnly ."
Mrs. Jennings	"The first , which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town , was to this effect . Berkeley Street , January . "" How surprised you will be , Willoughby , on receiving this ; and I think you will feel something more than surprise , when you know that I am in town ."
Mrs. Jennings	An opportunity of coming hither , though with Mrs. Jennings , was a temptation we could not resist . I wish you may receive this in time to come here to - night , but I will not depend on it .
Mrs. Jennings	At any rate I shall expect you to - morrow .
Mrs. Jennings	"Her second note , which had been written on the morning after the dance at the Middletons ' , was in these words:-- "" I can not express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday , nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week ago . I have been expecting to hear from you , and still more to see you , every hour of the day ."
Mrs. Jennings	Pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain .
Mrs. Jennings	I have been told that you were asked to be of the party . But could it be so ?
Mrs. Jennings	"But I will not suppose this possible , and I hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise . """
Mrs. Jennings	"The contents of her last note to him were these:-- "" What am I to imagine , Willoughby , by your behaviour last night ?"
Mrs. Jennings	Again I demand an explanation of it . I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced , with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared to me to justify .
Mrs. Jennings	I was repulsed indeed !
Mrs. Jennings	I have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting ; but though I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour , I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it . You have perhaps been misinformed , or purposely deceived , in something concerning me , which may have lowered me in your opinion .
Mrs. Jennings	Tell me what it is , explain the grounds on which you acted , and I shall be satisfied , in being able to satisfy you . It would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you ; but if I am to do it , if I am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you , that your regard for us all was insincere , that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive , let it be told as soon as possible .
Mrs. Jennings	My feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision ; I wish to acquit you , but certainty on either side will be ease to what I now suffer .
Mrs. Jennings	If your sentiments are no longer what they were , you will return my notes , and the lock of my hair which is in your possession .
Mrs. Jennings	I know he did .
Mrs. Jennings	Whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ) , I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish .
Mrs. Jennings	This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment !
Mrs. Jennings	When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again -- his distress -- can I ever forget his distress ?
Mrs. Jennings	I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion , than believe his nature capable of such cruelty . This woman of whom he writes -- whoever she be -- or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and Edward ,
Mrs. Jennings	may have been so barbarous to bely me .
Mrs. Jennings	Beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby , whose heart I know so well ?
Mrs. Jennings	"I must feel -- I must be wretched -- and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can . "" "" But for my mother 's sake and mine-- "" "" I would do more than for my own ."
Mrs. Jennings	I must go and comfort mama . Can not we be gone to - morrow ?
Mrs. Jennings	"We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility ; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that . "" "" Well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but I can not stay here long , I can not stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people ."
Mrs. Jennings	"Oh , what would HE say to that ! "" Elinor advised her to lie down again , and for a moment she did so ; but no attitude could give her ease ; and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another , till growing more and more hysterical , her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all , and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance ."
Mrs. Jennings	Some lavender drops , however , which she was at length persuaded to take , were of use ; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings returned , she continued on the bed quiet and motionless .
Mrs. Jennings	The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March , for the Easter holidays ; and Mrs. Jennings , with both her friends , received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them .
Mrs. Jennings	This would not , in itself , have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself , as , joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy , induced her to accept it with pleasure .
Mrs. Jennings	""" You forget , "" said Elinor gently , "" that its situation is not ... that it is not in the neighbourhood of ... "" "" But it is in Somersetshire.--I can not go into Somersetshire.--There , where I looked forward to going ..."
Mrs. Jennings	No , Elinor , you can not expect me to go there .
Mrs. Jennings	As Marianne 's affection for her mother was sincere , it must triumph with little difficulty , over the imaginary evils she had started .
Mrs. Jennings	Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest , that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland .
Mrs. Jennings	"Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods;""--was Mrs. Jennings 's address to him when he first called on her , after their leaving her was settled--""for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back!--Lord !"
Mrs. Jennings	""" Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it;-- and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor 's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might NOT hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne 's turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel 's inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house ."
Mrs. Jennings	She wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette . What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest .
Mrs. Jennings	"They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable , when another lucky stop in Marianne 's performance brought her these words in the Colonel 's calm voice,-- "" I am afraid it can not take place very soon . """
Mrs. Jennings	"Astonished and shocked at so unlover - like a speech , she was almost ready to cry out , "" Lord ! what should hinder it?""--but checking her desire , confined herself to this silent ejaculation . "" This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older . """
Mrs. Jennings	"This delay on the Colonel 's side , however , did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least , for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards , and moving different ways , Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say , and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said , "" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you . """
Mrs. Jennings	"Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude , and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence , the Colonel should be able to take leave of them , as he immediately did , with the utmost sang - froid , and go away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor . What had really passed between them was to this effect . "" I have heard , "" said he , with great compassion , "" of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?-- "" Elinor told him that it was ."
Mrs. Jennings	""" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty,""--he replied , with great feeling,--""of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to ."
Mrs. Jennings	The preferment , which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward , was already provided to enable him to marry;-- and SHE , of all people in the world , was fixed on to bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure , less pleasing , might have a share in that emotion , her esteem for the general benevolence , and her gratitude for the particular friendship , which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act , were strongly felt , and warmly expressed .
Mrs. Jennings	After this had been settled , Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour , and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret , that the house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor , as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do , made very light of , at least as far as regarded its size .
Mrs. Jennings	"His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least , I am afraid it can not take place very soon.-- "" Such was the sentence which , when misunderstood , so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings ; but after this narration of what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor , while they stood at the window , the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting , may perhaps appear in general , not less reasonably excited , nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage ."
Mrs. Jennings	How could you behave so unfairly by your sister ?
Mrs. Jennings	"And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me ; for a year or two back , when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together , she never made any bones of hiding in a closet , or behind a chimney - board , on purpose to hear what we said . "" Elinor tried to talk of something else ; but Miss Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes , from what was uppermost in her mind ."
Mrs. Jennings	And your brother and sister were not very kind !
Mrs. Jennings	And for my part , I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before ; but , however , nothing was said about them , and I took care to keep mine out of sight .
Mrs. Jennings	They will tell me I should write to the Doctor , to get Edward the curacy of his new living .
Mrs. Jennings	I know they will ; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.-- ' La ! '
Mrs. Jennings	I shall say directly , ' I wonder how you could think of such a thing ?
Mrs. Jennings	I write to the Doctor , indeed ! '
Mrs. Jennings	I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . I suppose Lady Middleton wo n't ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here .
Mrs. Jennings	Such was her parting concern ; for after this , she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings , before her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson ; and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time , though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind .
Mrs. Jennings	Edward 's marriage with Lucy was as firmly determined on , and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain ,
Mrs. Jennings	As soon as they returned to the carriage , Mrs. Jennings was eager for information ; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that Lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known .
Mrs. Jennings	"The continuance of their engagement , and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end , was all her communication ; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark . "" Wait for his having a living!--ay , we all know how THAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth , and finding no good comes of it , will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a - year , with the interest of his two thousand pounds , and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her.--Then they will have a child every year !"
Mrs. Jennings	"Two maids and two men , indeed!--as I talked of t'other day.--No , no , they must get a stout girl of all works.-- Betty 's sister would never do for them NOW . "" The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two - penny post from Lucy herself ."
Mrs. Jennings	I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her ; but I know
Mrs. Jennings	I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother 's anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and
Mrs. Jennings	should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs. Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr. Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us.--Poor
Mrs. Jennings	Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs. Jennings wo n't think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ' twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper reminds
Mrs. Jennings	"As soon as Elinor had finished it , she performed what she concluded to be its writer 's real design , by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings , who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise . "" Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye , that was quite proper to let him be off if he would ."
Mrs. Jennings	That was just like Lucy.--Poor soul !
Mrs. Jennings	I wish I COULD get him a living , with all my heart.--She calls me dear Mrs. Jennings , you see .
Mrs. Jennings	"It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw , and does Lucy 's head and heart great credit . """
Mrs. Jennings	25 Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends , she was not without a settled habitation of her own .
Mrs. Jennings	Since the death of her husband , who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town , she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square .
Mrs. Jennings	Towards this home , she began on the approach of January to turn her thoughts , and thither she one day abruptly , and very unexpectedly by them , asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her .
Mrs. Jennings	"Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise , and repeated her invitation immediately . """
Mrs. Jennings	I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I 've quite set my heart upon it .
Mrs. Jennings	""" "" Nay , "" cried Mrs. Jennings , "" I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne 's company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back ."
Mrs. Jennings	But one or the other , if not both of them , I must have .
Mrs. Jennings	""" "" I thank you , ma'am , sincerely thank you , "" said Marianne , with warmth : "" your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it ."
Mrs. Jennings	"It should not , must not be a struggle . "" Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare them perfectly well ; and Elinor , who now understood her sister , and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again , made no farther direct opposition to the plan , and merely referred it to her mother 's decision , from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit , which she could not approve of for Marianne , and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid . Whatever Marianne was desirous of , her mother would be eager to promote -- she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust ; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London . That Marianne , fastidious as she was , thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings ' manners , and invariably disgusted by them , should overlook every inconvenience of that kind , should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings , in her pursuit of one object , was such a proof , so strong , so full , of the importance of that object to her , as Elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness ."
Mrs. Jennings	""" My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings 's heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence ."
Mrs. Jennings	""" That is very true , "" replied her mother , "" but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton ."
Mrs. Jennings	""" If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings , "" said Marianne , "" at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation ."
Mrs. Jennings	"I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . "" Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours . To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy 's account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished . "" I will have you BOTH go , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ; "" these objections are nonsensical ."
Mrs. Jennings	Mrs. Jennings received the information with a great deal of joy , and many assurances of kindness and care ; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her .
Mrs. Jennings	"Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken - hearted , at Oxford.-- "" I do think , "" she continued , "" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again ."
Mrs. Jennings	And I must say that Lucy 's crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all .
Mrs. Jennings	I can not get him out of my head , but you must send for him to Barton , and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him
Mrs. Jennings	"27 "" If this open weather holds much longer , "" said Mrs. Jennings , when they met at breakfast the following morning , "" Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week ; ' tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day 's pleasure . Poor souls !"
Mrs. Jennings	I always pity them when they do ; they seem to take it so much to heart .
Mrs. Jennings	"This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country . "" It was a lucky recollection , all her good spirits were restored by it . "" It is charming weather for THEM indeed , "" she continued , as she sat down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance ."
Mrs. Jennings	""" At any rate , "" said Elinor , wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister 's thoughts as clearly as she did , "" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week ."
Mrs. Jennings	""" Ay , my dear , I 'll warrant you we do ."
Mrs. Jennings	The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs. Jennings 's acquaintance to inform them of her being in town ; and Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind , watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air .
Mrs. Jennings	The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings 's style of living , and set of acquaintance , than with her behaviour to themselves , which was invariably kind .
Mrs. Jennings	Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan , and excepting a few old city friends , whom , to Lady Middleton 's regret , she had never dropped , she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions . Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected , Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties , which , whether at home or abroad , formed only for cards , could have little to amuse her .
Mrs. Jennings	But Marianne seemed hardly to hear her , and on Mrs. Jenning 's entrance , escaped with the precious card .
Mrs. Jennings	""" No , ma'am , for my mistress . "" But Marianne , not convinced , took it instantly up ."
Mrs. Jennings	""" It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings ; how provoking ! """
Mrs. Jennings	Elinor , distressed by this charge of reserve in herself , which she was not at liberty to do away , knew not how , under such circumstances , to press for greater openness in Marianne . Mrs. Jennings soon appeared , and the note being given her , she read it aloud .
Mrs. Jennings	It was from Lady Middleton , announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before , and requesting the company of her mother and cousins the following evening . Business on Sir John 's part , and a violent cold on her own , prevented their calling in Berkeley Street .
Mrs. Jennings	The invitation was accepted ; but when the hour of appointment drew near , necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings , that they should both attend her on such a visit , Elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go , for still she had seen nothing of Willoughby ; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad , than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence .
Mrs. Jennings	In the country , an unpremeditated dance was very allowable ; but in London , where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained , it was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls , to have it known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple , with two violins , and a mere side - board collation . Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party ; from the former , whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town , as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother - in - law , and therefore never came near her , they received no mark of recognition on their entrance .
Mrs. Jennings	""" Aye , aye , "" said Mrs. Jennings , "" we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . "" Marianne said no more , but looked exceedingly hurt . Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister 's relief , Elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother , and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne , to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed ; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow , that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby , for she could not suppose it to be to any other person . About the middle of the day , Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on business , and Elinor began her letter directly , while Marianne , too restless for employment , too anxious for conversation , walked from one window to the other , or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation ."
Mrs. Jennings	Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother , relating all that had passed , her suspicions of Willoughby 's inconstancy , urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him . Her letter was scarcely finished , when a rap foretold a visitor , and Colonel Brandon was announced .
Sir John Middleton	The house and the garden , with all the objects surrounding them , were now become familiar , and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford , since the loss of their father . Sir John Middleton , who called on them every day for the first fortnight , and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home , could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed .
Sir John Middleton	Their visitors , except those from Barton Park , were not many ; for , in spite of Sir John 's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood , and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service , the independence of Mrs. Dashwood 's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children ; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk . There were but few who could be so classed ; and it was not all of them that were attainable . About a mile and a half from the cottage , along the narrow winding valley of Allenham , which issued from that of Barton , as formerly described , the girls had , in one of their earliest walks , discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which , by reminding them a little of Norland , interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it .
Sir John Middleton	The honour was readily granted , and he then departed , to make himself still more interesting , in the midst of a heavy rain . His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration , and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.-- Marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest , for the confusion which crimsoned over her face , on his lifting her up , had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house . But she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise . His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story ; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality , there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her .
Sir John Middleton	"Her imagination was busy , her reflections were pleasant , and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded . Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors ; and Marianne 's accident being related to him , he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham . "" Willoughby ! "" cried Sir John ; "" what , is HE in the country ?"
Sir John Middleton	"That is good news however ; I will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on Thursday . "" "" You know him then , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ."
Sir John Middleton	""" As good a kind of fellow as ever lived , I assure you ."
Sir John Middleton	""" And is that all you can say for him ? "" cried Marianne , indignantly ."
Sir John Middleton	Sir John was rather puzzled .
Sir John Middleton	""" Upon my soul , "" said he , "" I do not know much about him as to all THAT . But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw ."
Sir John Middleton	""" But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr. Willoughby 's pointer , than he could describe to her the shades of his mind ."
Sir John Middleton	"On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence ; and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the country ; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court , to whom he was related , and whose possessions he was to inherit ; adding , "" Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself ."
Sir John Middleton	"Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . "" "" I do not believe , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , with a good humoured smile , "" that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him . It is not an employment to which they have been brought up . Men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich ."
Sir John Middleton	I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible .
Sir John Middleton	""" "" He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived , "" repeated Sir John ."
Sir John Middleton	""" I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o'clock till four , without once sitting down ."
Sir John Middleton	""" "" Aye , aye , I see how it will be , "" said Sir John , "" I see how it will be ."
Sir John Middleton	You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon .
Sir John Middleton	""" That is an expression , Sir John , "" said Marianne , warmly , "" which I particularly dislike ."
Sir John Middleton	""" Sir John did not much understand this reproof ; but he laughed as heartily as if he did , and then replied , "" Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other ."
Sir John Middleton	Poor Brandon !
Sir John Middleton	he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles .
Sir John Middleton	21 The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day , and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain each other . But this did not last long ; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head , had hardly done wondering at Charlotte 's being so happy without a cause , at Mr. Palmer 's acting so simply , with good abilities , and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife , before Sir John 's and Mrs. Jennings 's active zeal in the cause of society , procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe .
Sir John Middleton	In a morning 's excursion to Exeter , they had met with two young ladies , whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations , and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to the park , as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over . Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation , and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the return of Sir John , by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life , and of whose elegance,-- whose tolerable gentility even , she could have no proof ; for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all .
Sir John Middleton	As it was impossible , however , now to prevent their coming , Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it , with all the philosophy of a well - bred woman , contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times every day .
Sir John Middleton	Sir John 's confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise , and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles ' arrival , and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world . From such commendation as this , however , there was not much to be learned ; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of England , under every possible variation of form , face , temper and understanding .
Sir John Middleton	Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his guests .
Sir John Middleton	Benevolent , philanthropic man !
Sir John Middleton	It was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself .
Sir John Middleton	""" Do come now , "" said he--""pray come -- you must come -- I declare you shall come -- You ca n't think how you will like them ."
Sir John Middleton	And they both long to see you of all things , for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world ; and I have told them it is all very true , and a great deal more .
Sir John Middleton	You will be delighted with them I am sure .
Sir John Middleton	How can you be so cross as not to come ? Why they are your cousins , you know , after a fashion . YOU are my cousins , and they are my wife 's , so you must be related .
Sir John Middleton	But Sir John could not prevail .
Sir John Middleton	He could only obtain a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two , and then left them in amazement at their indifference , to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the Miss Steeles , as he had been already boasting of the Miss Steeles to them .
Sir John Middleton	""" John is in such spirits today ! "" said she , on his taking Miss Steeles 's pocket handkerchief , and throwing it out of window--""He is full of monkey tricks . """
Sir John Middleton	""" And Sir John too , "" cried the elder sister , "" what a charming man he is ! """
Sir John Middleton	She merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly .
Sir John Middleton	""" We have heard Sir John admire it excessively , "" said Lucy , who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister ."
Sir John Middleton	I suppose your brother was quite a beau , Miss Dashwood , before he married , as he was so rich ?
Sir John Middleton	But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him .
Sir John Middleton	Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter , well provided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton , his family , and all his relations , and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins , whom they declared to be the most beautiful , elegant , accomplished , and agreeable girls they had ever beheld , and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.-- And to be better acquainted therefore , Elinor soon found was their inevitable lot , for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles , their party would be too strong for opposition , and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to , which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the same room almost every day .
Sir John Middleton	Sir John could do no more ; but he did not know that any more was required : to be together was , in his opinion , to be intimate , and while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual , he had not a doubt of their being established friends .
Sir John Middleton	To do him justice , he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve , by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins ' situations in the most delicate particulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice , before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister 's having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton .
Sir John Middleton	""" ' Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure , "" said she , "" and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already ."
Sir John Middleton	""" Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward , than he had been with respect to Marianne ; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two , as being somewhat newer and more conjectural ; and since Edward 's visit , they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks , as to excite general attention . The letter F-- had been likewise invariably brought forward , and found productive of such countless jokes , that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long established with Elinor ."
Sir John Middleton	into the concerns of their family . But Sir John did not sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise , for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name , as Miss Steele had in hearing it .
Sir John Middleton	""" His name is Ferrars , "" said he , in a very audible whisper ; "" but pray do not tell it , for it 's a great secret ."
Sir John Middleton	The manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward , increased her curiosity ; for it struck her as being rather ill - natured , and suggested the suspicion of that lady 's knowing , or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing , for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars 's name by Miss Steele when alluded to , or even openly mentioned by Sir John .
Sir John Middleton	Colonel Brandon tell you of it !
Sir John Middleton	"To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do . "" "" But I do assure you it was so , for all that , and I will tell you how it happened ."
Sir John Middleton	When we met him , he turned back and walked with us ; and so we began talking of my brother and sister , and one thing and another , and I said to him , ' So , Colonel , there is a new family come to Barton cottage , I hear , and mama sends me word they are very pretty , and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna .
Sir John Middleton	""" "" And what did the Colonel say ? """
Sir John Middleton	""" Oh -- he did not say much ; but he looked as if he knew it to be true , so from that moment I set it down as certain ."
Sir John Middleton	""" Mr. Brandon was very well I hope ? "" "" Oh !"
Sir John Middleton	yes , quite well ; and so full of your praises , he did nothing but say fine things of you .
Sir John Middleton	""" I am flattered by his commendation ."
Sir John Middleton	"He seems an excellent man ; and I think him uncommonly pleasing . "" "" So do I.--He is such a charming man , that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull ."
Sir John Middleton	Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was , for he hardly ever falls in love with any body .
Sir John Middleton	""" "" You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon , have not you ?"
Sir John Middleton	He was a particular friend of Sir John 's .
Sir John Middleton	"I believe , "" she added in a low voice , "" he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could ."
Sir John Middleton	Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much .
Sir John Middleton	"But mama did not think the match good enough for me , otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel , and we should have been married immediately . """
Sir John Middleton	""" Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John 's proposal to your mother before it was made ? Had he never owned his affection to yourself ?"
Sir John Middleton	""" Oh , no ; but if mama had not objected to it , I dare say he would have liked it of all things ."
Sir John Middleton	He had not seen me then above twice , for it was before I left school .
Sir John Middleton	Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings ,
Sir John Middleton	"but there were two others , a gentleman and lady , who were quite unknown to her . She was sitting near the window , and as soon as Sir John perceived her , he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door , and stepping across the turf , obliged her to open the casement to speak to him , though the space was so short between the door and the window , as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other . "" Well , "" said he , "" we have brought you some strangers ."
Sir John Middleton	Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you .
Sir John Middleton	"I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again""-- Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John ."
Sir John Middleton	She came in with a smile , smiled all the time of her visit , except when she laughed , and smiled when she went away . Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty , with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife , but of less willingness to please or be pleased .
Sir John Middleton	He entered the room with a look of self - consequence , slightly bowed to the ladies , without speaking a word , and , after briefly surveying them and their apartments , took up a newspaper from the table , and continued to read it as long as he staid .
Sir John Middleton	Should not you , Mr. Palmer ?
Sir John Middleton	""" Mr. Palmer made her no answer , and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper ."
Sir John Middleton	""" Mr. Palmer does not hear me , "" said she , laughing ; "" he never does sometimes ."
Sir John Middleton	"Mrs. Palmer laughed , and said it would not do her any harm . "" She expects to be confined in February , "" continued Mrs. Jennings . Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation , and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in the paper . "" No , none at all , "" he replied , and read on ."
Sir John Middleton	""" Here comes Marianne , "" cried Sir John ."
Sir John Middleton	He immediately went into the passage , opened the front door , and ushered her in himself . Mrs. Jennings asked her , as soon as she appeared , if she had not been to Allenham ; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question , as to show she understood it .
Sir John Middleton	Mr. Palmer looked up on her entering the room , stared at her some minutes , and then returned to his newspaper . Mrs. Palmer 's eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room . She got up to examine them .
Sir John Middleton	When Lady Middleton rose to go away , Mr. Palmer rose also , laid down the newspaper , stretched himself and looked at them all around .
Sir John Middleton	""" My love , have you been asleep ? "" said his wife , laughing ."
Sir John Middleton	He made her no answer ; and only observed , after again examining the room , that it was very low pitched , and that the ceiling was crooked . He then made his bow , and departed with the rest .
Sir John Middleton	Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park .
Sir John Middleton	But they had no curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner , and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way . They attempted , therefore , likewise , to excuse themselves ; the weather was uncertain , and not likely to be good .
Sir John Middleton	But Sir John would not be satisfied -- the carriage should be sent for them and they must come .
Sir John Middleton	She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again , she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward , whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him , and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy , by her readiness to enter on the matter again , and her calmness in conversing on it , that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend , which she very much feared her involuntary agitation , in their morning discourse , must have left at least doubtful . That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable : it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise , not merely from Lucy 's assertion , but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance , with a secret so confessedly and evidently important . And even Sir John 's joking intelligence must have had some weight . But indeed , while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward , it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous ; and
Sir John Middleton	Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady Middleton 's head ; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for a general chat , and none at all for particular discourse .
Sir John Middleton	One or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private , when Sir John called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles . Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother 's permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise .
Sir John Middleton	She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day , when Edward 's name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all .
Sir John Middleton	Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing ; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland .
Sir John Middleton	"A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them . "" She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton ; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection ."
Sir John Middleton	Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture . He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture was all sent around by water . It chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne 's .
Sir John Middleton	The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress 's arrival ; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John 's description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own .
Sir John Middleton	Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate , their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment .
Sir John Middleton	"But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind , and to be convinced , from the general drift of his discourse , that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland . He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away . In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton 's first letter to Norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey . Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved . "" Dear , dear Norland ! "" said Marianne , as she wandered alone before the house , on the last evening of their being there ; "" when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh ! happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And"
Sir John Middleton	She gave her an answer which marked her contempt , and instantly left the room , resolving that , whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal , her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations . In this state of her spirits , a letter was delivered to her from the post , which contained a proposal particularly well timed . It was the offer of a small house , on very easy terms , belonging to a relation of her own , a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire .
Sir John Middleton	The letter was from this gentleman himself , and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation . He understood that she was in need of a dwelling ; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage , he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary , if the situation pleased her .
Sir John Middleton	He earnestly pressed her , after giving the particulars of the house and garden , to come with her daughters to Barton Park , the place of his own residence , from whence she might judge , herself , whether Barton Cottage , for the houses were in the same parish , could , by any alteration , be made comfortable to her .
Sir John Middleton	He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin ; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections .
Sir John Middleton	She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness , and her acceptance of his proposal ; and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters , that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent . Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland , than immediately amongst their present acquaintance .
Sir John Middleton	The house , too , as described by Sir John , was on so simple a scale , and the rent so uncommonly moderate , as to leave her no right of objection on either point ; and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence .
Sir John Middleton	Mrs. Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her . His manners to THEM , though calm , were perfectly kind ; to Mrs. Jennings , most attentively civil ; and on Colonel Brandon 's coming in soon after himself , he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say , that he only wanted to know him to be rich , to be equally civil to HIM . After staying with them half an hour , he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street , and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton .
Sir John Middleton	They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home , and Sir John came in before their visit ended .
Sir John Middleton	Sir John was ready to like anybody , and though Mr. Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses , he soon set him down as a very good - natured fellow : while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think
Sir John Middleton	The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley , but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill . The house was large and handsome ; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance . The former was for Sir John 's gratification , the latter for that of his lady .
Sir John Middleton	Sir John was a sportsman , Lady Middleton a mother .
Sir John Middleton	He hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources .
Sir John Middleton	Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round , while Sir John 's independent employments were in existence only half the time .
Sir John Middleton	Continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of Sir John , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife .
Sir John Middleton	But Sir John 's satisfaction in society was much more real ; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold , and the noisier they were the better was he pleased .
Sir John Middleton	He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood , for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors , and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen . The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and
Sir John Middleton	in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton .
Sir John Middleton	It was enough to secure his good opinion ; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person .
Sir John Middleton	The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate . In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor .
Sir John Middleton	Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by Sir John , who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity ; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before , at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them .
Sir John Middleton	They would see , he said , only one gentleman there besides himself ; a particular friend who was staying at the park , but who was neither very young nor very gay . He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party , and could assure them it should never happen so again .
Sir John Middleton	He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number , but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements .
Sir John Middleton	Luckily Lady Middleton 's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . The young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . Mrs. Jennings , Lady Middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . She was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . Marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs. Jennings 's . Colonel Brandon , the friend of Sir John , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than Lady Middleton was to be his wife , or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton 's mother . He was silent and grave .
Sir John Middleton	There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother - in - law was interesting .
Sir John Middleton	Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song , and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted .
Sir John Middleton	Lady Middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one 's attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished .
Sir John Middleton	Her manners had all the elegance which her husband 's wanted . But they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by shewing that , though perfectly well - bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common - place inquiry or remark .
Sir John Middleton	Conversation however was not wanted , for Sir John was very chatty , and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a fine little boy about six years old , by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to enquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions which his mother
Sir John Middleton	On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party , by way of provision for discourse . In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother , and in what particular he resembled either , for of course every body differed , and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others .
Sir John Middleton	An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children , as Sir John would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day .
Sir John Middleton	And his person , his manners too , are all in his favour .
Sir John Middleton	My partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby -- but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.-- There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby 's eyes at times , which I did not like .
Sir John Middleton	I avoided the Middletons as much as possible , as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common . Not aware of their being in town , however , I blundered on Sir John , I believe , the first day of his coming , and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings 's .
Sir John Middleton	He asked me to a party , a dance at his house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there , I should have felt it too certain a thing , to trust myself near him .
Sir John Middleton	The next morning brought another short note from Marianne-- still affectionate , open , artless , confiding -- everything that could make MY conduct most hateful .
Sir John Middleton	"But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard of her illness . "" "" Last night , in Drury Lane lobby , I ran against Sir John Middleton , and when he saw who I was -- for the first time these two months -- he spoke to me.--That he had cut me ever since my marriage , I had seen without surprise or resentment . Now , however , his good - natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to -- though probably he did not think it WOULD -- vex me horridly . As bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland -- a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent -- the Palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c.--I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John . His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill - will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy ."
Sir John Middleton	The world had made him extravagant and vain -- Extravagance and vanity had made him cold - hearted and selfish .
Sir John Middleton	Vanity , while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another , had involved him in a real attachment , which extravagance , or at least its offspring , necessity , had required to be sacrificed .
Sir John Middleton	Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil , had led him likewise to punishment .
Sir John Middleton	"The attachment , from which against honour , against feeling , against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself , now , when no longer allowable , governed every thought ; and the connection , for the sake of which he had , with little scruple , left her sister to misery , was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature . From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said-- "" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off . "" "" Are you going back to town ?"
Sir John Middleton	"She can never be more lost to you than she is now . """
Sir John Middleton	should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs. Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr. Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us.--Poor
Sir John Middleton	"me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne , "" I am , & c. """
Sir John Middleton	"Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he took it , looked at the direction , changed colour , and immediately left the room . "" What is the matter with Brandon ? "" said Sir John . Nobody could tell ."
Sir John Middleton	""" We must go , "" said Sir John.--""It shall not be put off when we are so near it ."
Sir John Middleton	"I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . "" "" I have a notion , "" said Sir John , "" that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it ."
Sir John Middleton	Sir John was delighted ; for to a man , whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone , the acquisition of two , to the number of inhabitants in London , was something .
Sir John Middleton	Their favour increased ; they could not be spared ; Sir John would not hear of their going ; and in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter , in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately , which was in full force at the end of every week , they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park , and to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance .
Marianne Dashwood	Their visitors , except those from Barton Park , were not many ; for , in spite of Sir John 's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood , and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service , the independence of Mrs. Dashwood 's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children ; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk . There were but few who could be so classed ; and it was not all of them that were attainable . About a mile and a half from the cottage , along the narrow winding valley of Allenham , which issued from that of Barton , as formerly described , the girls had , in one of their earliest walks , discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which , by reminding them a little of Norland , interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it .
Marianne Dashwood	The high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits , were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties ; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one memorable morning direct their steps , attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky , and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned .
Marianne Dashwood	in spite of Marianne 's declaration that the day
Marianne Dashwood	""" Is there a felicity in the world , "" said Marianne , "" superior to this?--Margaret , we will walk here at least two hours . """
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne had at first the advantage , but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground ; and Margaret , unable to stop herself to assist her , was involuntarily hurried along , and reached the bottom in safety . A gentleman carrying a gun , with two pointers playing round him , was passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne , when her accident happened .
Marianne Dashwood	He put down his gun and ran to her assistance . She had raised herself from the ground , but her foot had been twisted in her fall , and she was scarcely able to stand .
Marianne Dashwood	The gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . Then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by Margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither Margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour . Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression .
Marianne Dashwood	Had he been even old , ugly , and vulgar , the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child ; but the influence of youth , beauty , and elegance ,
Marianne Dashwood	gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings .
Marianne Dashwood	She thanked him again and again ; and , with a sweetness of address which always attended her , invited him to be seated .
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged .
Marianne Dashwood	His name , he replied , was Willoughby , and his present home was at Allenham , from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood .
Marianne Dashwood	The honour was readily granted , and he then departed , to make himself still more interesting , in the midst of a heavy rain . His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration , and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.-- Marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest , for the confusion which crimsoned over her face , on his lifting her up , had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house . But she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise . His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story ; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality , there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her .
Marianne Dashwood	"Her imagination was busy , her reflections were pleasant , and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded . Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors ; and Marianne 's accident being related to him , he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham . "" Willoughby ! "" cried Sir John ; "" what , is HE in the country ?"
Marianne Dashwood	"That is good news however ; I will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on Thursday . "" "" You know him then , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Know him ! to be sure I do . Why , he is down here every year ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" And is that all you can say for him ? "" cried Marianne , indignantly ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr. Willoughby 's pointer , than he could describe to her the shades of his mind ."
Marianne Dashwood	"On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence ; and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the country ; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court , to whom he was related , and whose possessions he was to inherit ; adding , "" Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself ."
Marianne Dashwood	"Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . "" "" I do not believe , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , with a good humoured smile , "" that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him . It is not an employment to which they have been brought up . Men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich ."
Marianne Dashwood	I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible .
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" Did he indeed ? "" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes , "" and with elegance , with spirit ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . "" "" That is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be ."
Marianne Dashwood	You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon .
Marianne Dashwood	""" That is an expression , Sir John , "" said Marianne , warmly , "" which I particularly dislike ."
Marianne Dashwood	I abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is intended ; and ' setting one 's cap at a man , ' or ' making a conquest , ' are the most odious of all .
Marianne Dashwood	""" Sir John did not much understand this reproof ; but he laughed as heartily as if he did , and then replied , "" Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other ."
Marianne Dashwood	he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles .
Marianne Dashwood	Their being her relations too made it so much the worse ; and Mrs. Jennings 's attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded , when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable ; because they were all cousins and must put up with one another .
Marianne Dashwood	""" Do come now , "" said he--""pray come -- you must come -- I declare you shall come -- You ca n't think how you will like them ."
Marianne Dashwood	You will be delighted with them I am sure .
Marianne Dashwood	How can you be so cross as not to come ? Why they are your cousins , you know , after a fashion . YOU are my cousins , and they are my wife 's , so you must be related .
Marianne Dashwood	She saw their sashes untied , their hair pulled about their ears , their work - bags searched , and their knives and scissors stolen away , and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment . It suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by , without claiming a share in what was passing .
Marianne Dashwood	""" John is in such spirits today ! "" said she , on his taking Miss Steeles 's pocket handkerchief , and throwing it out of window--""He is full of monkey tricks . """
Marianne Dashwood	"And soon afterwards , on the second boy 's violently pinching one of the same lady 's fingers , she fondly observed , "" How playful William is ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" It might have been a very sad accident . "" "" Yet I hardly know how , "" cried Marianne , "" unless it had been under totally different circumstances ."
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne was silent ; it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel , however trivial the occasion ; and upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it , always fell .
Marianne Dashwood	"A short pause succeeded this speech , which was first broken by Miss Steele , who seemed very much disposed for conversation , and who now said rather abruptly , "" And how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" We have heard Sir John admire it excessively , "" said Lucy , who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" But why should you think , "" said Lucy , looking ashamed of her sister , "" that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex ? "" "" Nay , my dear , I 'm sure I do n't pretend to say that there an't ."
Marianne Dashwood	I suppose your brother was quite a beau , Miss Dashwood , before he married , as he was so rich ?
Marianne Dashwood	""" Upon my word , "" replied Elinor , "" I can not tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word ."
Marianne Dashwood	"Anne , "" cried her sister , "" you can talk of nothing but beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else . """
Marianne Dashwood	The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation , and as Elinor was not blinded by the beauty , or the shrewd look of the youngest , to her want of real elegance and artlessness , she left the house without any wish of knowing them better .
Marianne Dashwood	To do him justice , he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve , by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins ' situations in the most delicate particulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice , before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister 's having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton .
Marianne Dashwood	""" ' Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure , "" said she , "" and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward , than he had been with respect to Marianne ; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two , as being somewhat newer and more conjectural ; and since Edward 's visit , they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks , as to excite general attention . The letter F-- had been likewise invariably brought forward , and found productive of such countless jokes , that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long established with Elinor ."
Marianne Dashwood	your sister - in - law 's brother , Miss Dashwood ?
Marianne Dashwood	""" How can you say so , Anne ? "" cried Lucy , who generally made an amendment to all her sister 's assertions . """
Marianne Dashwood	"To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do . "" "" But I do assure you it was so , for all that , and I will tell you how it happened ."
Marianne Dashwood	When we met him , he turned back and walked with us ; and so we began talking of my brother and sister , and one thing and another , and I said to him , ' So , Colonel , there is a new family come to Barton cottage , I hear , and mama sends me word they are very pretty , and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna .
Marianne Dashwood	for of course you must know , as you have been in Devonshire so lately . '
Marianne Dashwood	Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was , for he hardly ever falls in love with any body .
Marianne Dashwood	Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes , and so you may tell your sister .
Marianne Dashwood	She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her .
Marianne Dashwood	However , I do n't think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night .
Marianne Dashwood	And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married !
Marianne Dashwood	""" Yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married.--"
Marianne Dashwood	Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters , without extending the passion to her ; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself .
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" Strange that it would ! "" cried Marianne ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Elinor , for shame ! "" said Marianne , "" money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it ."
Marianne Dashwood	YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ?
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" And yet two thousand a - year is a very moderate income , "" said Marianne ."
Marianne Dashwood	I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands .
Marianne Dashwood	"A proper establishment of servants , a carriage , perhaps two , and hunters , can not be supported on less . "" Elinor smiled again , to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna . "" Hunters ! "" repeated Edward--""but why must you have hunters ? Every body does not hunt . "" Marianne coloured as she replied , "" But most people do ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Oh that they would ! "" cried Marianne , her eyes sparkling with animation , and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" We are all unanimous in that wish , I suppose , "" said Elinor , "" in spite of the insufficiency of wealth ."
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point .
Marianne Dashwood	""" You must begin your improvements on this house , "" observed Elinor , "" and your difficulties will soon vanish ."
Marianne Dashwood	You , Miss Dashwood , would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you -- and as for Marianne , I know her greatness of soul , there would not be music enough in London to content her .
Marianne Dashwood	And books!--Thomson , Cowper , Scott -- she would buy them all over and over again : she would buy up every copy , I believe , to prevent their falling into unworthy hands ; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree .
Marianne Dashwood	Should not you , Marianne ?
Marianne Dashwood	"But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old disputes . "" "" I love to be reminded of the past , Edward -- whether it be melancholy or gay , I love to recall it -- and you will never offend me by talking of former times ."
Marianne Dashwood	You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent -- some of it , at least -- my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books .
Marianne Dashwood	""" No , Edward , I should have something else to do with it . "" "" Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life -- your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ? "" "" Undoubtedly ."
Marianne Dashwood	At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed .
Marianne Dashwood	"It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them . "" "" Marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see , "" said Elinor , "" she is not at all altered ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" She is only grown a little more grave than she was . "" "" Nay , Edward , "" said Marianne , "" you need not reproach me ."
Marianne Dashwood	"You are not very gay yourself . "" "" Why should you think so ! "" replied he , with a sigh ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" But gaiety never was a part of MY character . "" "" Nor do I think it a part of Marianne 's , "" said Elinor ; "" I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest , very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry . "" "" I believe you are right , "" he replied , "" and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes , "" said Elinor , "" in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" But I thought it was right , Elinor , "" said Marianne , "" to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people ."
Marianne Dashwood	I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours .
Marianne Dashwood	This has always been your doctrine , I am sure .
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" No , Marianne , never ."
Marianne Dashwood	You must not confound my meaning .
Marianne Dashwood	I am guilty , I confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ?
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility , "" said Edward to Elinor , "" Do you gain no ground ?"
Marianne Dashwood	""" Quite the contrary , "" replied Elinor , looking expressively at Marianne ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" My judgment , "" he returned , "" is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister 's ."
Marianne Dashwood	"I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company , I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility ! "" "" Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers , "" said Elinor ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" She knows her own worth too well for false shame , "" replied Edward ."
Marianne Dashwood	"If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful , I should not be shy . "" "" But you would still be reserved , "" said Marianne , "" and that is worse ."
Marianne Dashwood	"Am I reserved , Marianne ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I do not understand you , "" replied he , colouring ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Reserved!--how , in what manner ? What am I to tell you ?"
Marianne Dashwood	"What can you suppose ? """
Marianne Dashwood	"Elinor looked surprised at his emotion ; but trying to laugh off the subject , she said to him , "" Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ? Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ? "" Edward made no answer ."
Marianne Dashwood	He valued their kindness beyond any thing , and his greatest happiness was in being with them . Yet , he must leave them at the end of a week , in spite of their wishes and his own , and without any restraint on his time . Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother 's account ; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her , as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son .
Marianne Dashwood	Disappointed , however , and vexed as she was , and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself , she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications , which had been rather more painfully extorted from her , for Willoughby 's service , by her mother . His want of spirits , of openness , and of consistency , were most usually attributed to his want of independence , and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars 's disposition and designs . The shortness of his visit , the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them , originated in the same fettered inclination , the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother . The old well - established grievance of duty against will , parent against child , was the cause of all .
Marianne Dashwood	She would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease , this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed , and her son be at liberty to be happy .
Marianne Dashwood	"But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward 's affection , to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton , and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger . "" I think , Edward , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , as they were at breakfast the last morning , "" you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions ."
Marianne Dashwood	Your mother will secure to you , in time , that independence you are so anxious for ; it is her duty , and it will , it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent .
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" I think , "" replied Edward , "" that I may defy many months to produce any good to me . "" This desponding turn of mind , though it could not be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood , gave additional pain to them all in the parting , which shortly took place , and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor 's feelings especially , which required some trouble and time to subdue . But as it was her determination to subdue it , and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away , she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne , on a similar occasion , to augment and fix her sorrow , by seeking silence , solitude and idleness ."
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor sat down to her drawing - table as soon as he was out of the house , busily employed herself the whole day , neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name , appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family , and if , by this conduct , she did not lessen her own grief , it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase , and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account .
Marianne Dashwood	Such behaviour as this , so exactly the reverse of her own , appeared no more meritorious to Marianne , than her own had seemed faulty to her . The business of self - command she settled very easily;--with strong affections it was impossible , with calm ones it could have no merit . That her sister 's affections WERE calm , she dared not deny , though she blushed to acknowledge it ; and of the strength of her own , she gave a very striking proof , by still loving and respecting that sister , in spite of this mortifying conviction .
Marianne Dashwood	Without shutting herself up from her family , or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them , or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation , Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of Edward , and of Edward 's behaviour , in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce,--with tenderness , pity , approbation , censure , and doubt . There were moments in abundance , when , if not by the absence of her mother and sisters , at least by the nature of their employments , conversation was forbidden among them , and every effect of solitude was produced .
Marianne Dashwood	""" Where is Marianne ?"
Marianne Dashwood	Has she run away because we are come ?
Marianne Dashwood	"I see her instrument is open . "" "" She is walking , I believe . """
Marianne Dashwood	She was short and plump , had a very pretty face , and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be . Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister 's , but they were much more prepossessing .
Marianne Dashwood	but you have made it so charming ! Only look , sister , how delightful every thing is !
Marianne Dashwood	""" You may believe how glad we all were to see them , "" added Mrs. Jennings , leaning forward towards Elinor , and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else , though they were seated on different sides of the room ; "" but , however , I ca n't help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Here comes Marianne , "" cried Sir John ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Now , Palmer , you shall see a monstrous pretty girl . """
Marianne Dashwood	He immediately went into the passage , opened the front door , and ushered her in himself . Mrs. Jennings asked her , as soon as she appeared , if she had not been to Allenham ; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question , as to show she understood it .
Marianne Dashwood	Lady Middleton too , though she did not press their mother , pressed them .
Marianne Dashwood	""" Why should they ask us ? "" said Marianne , as soon as they were gone . "" The rent of this cottage is said to be low ; but we have it on very hard terms , if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them , or with us . """
Marianne Dashwood	When Marianne was recovered , the schemes of amusement at home and abroad , which Sir John had been previously forming , were put into execution .
Marianne Dashwood	In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included ; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods , to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne , of marking his animated admiration of her , and of receiving , in her behaviour to himself , the most pointed assurance of her affection .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment .
Marianne Dashwood	She only wished that it were less openly shewn ; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of
Marianne Dashwood	- command to Marianne
Marianne Dashwood	But Marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve ; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable , appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort , but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common - place and mistaken notions .
Marianne Dashwood	When he was present she had no eyes for any one else .
Marianne Dashwood	If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards , he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand .
Marianne Dashwood	This was the season of happiness to Marianne .
Marianne Dashwood	Her heart was not so much at ease , nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure .
Marianne Dashwood	They afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind , nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than ever .
Marianne Dashwood	Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse .
Marianne Dashwood	She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times ; and had Elinor 's memory been equal to her means of improvement , she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jenning 's last illness , and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do .
Marianne Dashwood	Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them ; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired .
Marianne Dashwood	She had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before .
Marianne Dashwood	Her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home;-- and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys . In Colonel Brandon alone , of all her new acquaintance , did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities , excite the interest of friendship , or give pleasure as a companion . Willoughby was out of the question .
Marianne Dashwood	Her admiration and regard , even her sisterly regard , was all his own ; but he was a lover ; his attentions were wholly Marianne 's , and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing .
Marianne Dashwood	"Colonel Brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne , and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister . Elinor 's compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him . This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park , when they were sitting down together by mutual consent , while the others were dancing . His eyes were fixed on Marianne , and , after a silence of some minutes , he said , with a faint smile , "" Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No , "" replied Elinor , "" her opinions are all romantic ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne 's , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for"
Marianne Dashwood	"After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,-- "" Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ?"
Marianne Dashwood	"I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an inforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances""-- Here he stopt suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered Elinor 's head . The lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips ."
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor attempted no more .
Marianne Dashwood	But Marianne , in her place , would not have done so little .
Marianne Dashwood	The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination ; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love .
Marianne Dashwood	Yes , Marianne , even in a man between thirty and forty .
Marianne Dashwood	"I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature . "" "" That is to say , "" cried Marianne contemptuously , "" he has told you , that in the East Indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome . "" "" He WOULD have told me so , I doubt not , had I made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed . "" "" Perhaps , "" said Willoughby , "" his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins . "" "" I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour ."
Marianne Dashwood	But why should you dislike him ?
Marianne Dashwood	""" Add to which , "" cried Marianne , "" that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . That his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , "" replied Elinor , "" and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Miss Dashwood , "" cried Willoughby , "" you are now using me unkindly . You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will ."
Marianne Dashwood	You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful .
Marianne Dashwood	I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon ; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and I can not persuade him to buy my brown mare . If it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable
Marianne Dashwood	"And in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you can not deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever . """
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne , not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself
Marianne Dashwood	"NOW especially there can not be -- but however , you and Marianne were always great favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?""--"
Marianne Dashwood	Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture . He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture was all sent around by water . It chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne 's .
Marianne Dashwood	"But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind , and to be convinced , from the general drift of his discourse , that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland . He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away . In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton 's first letter to Norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey . Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved . "" Dear , dear Norland ! "" said Marianne , as she wandered alone before the house , on the last evening of their being there ; "" when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh ! happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And"
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" I shall very soon think him handsome , Elinor , if I do not now ."
Marianne Dashwood	"When you tell me to love him as a brother , I shall no more see imperfection in his face , than I now do in his heart . "" Elinor started at this declaration , and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into , in speaking of him ."
Marianne Dashwood	She believed the regard to be mutual ; but she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne 's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her .
Marianne Dashwood	She knew that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment , they believed the next -- that with them , to wish was to hope , and to hope was to expect . She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister .
Marianne Dashwood	"Marianne here burst forth with indignation-- "" Esteem him !"
Marianne Dashwood	"Use those words again , and I will leave the room this moment . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" And you really are not engaged to him ! "" said she ."
Marianne Dashwood	I shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . Oh !
Marianne Dashwood	"if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself , how delightful it would be ! """
Marianne Dashwood	She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it .
Marianne Dashwood	Luckily Lady Middleton 's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . The young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . Mrs. Jennings , Lady Middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . She was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . Marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs. Jennings 's . Colonel Brandon , the friend of Sir John , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than Lady Middleton was to be his wife , or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton 's mother . He was silent and grave .
Marianne Dashwood	His appearance however was not unpleasing , in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor , for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty ; but though his face was not handsome , his countenance was sensible , and his address was particularly gentlemanlike .
Marianne Dashwood	In the evening , as Marianne was discovered to be musical , she was invited to play . The instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and Marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother 's account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it .
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne 's performance was highly applauded .
Marianne Dashwood	Lady Middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one 's attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished .
Marianne Dashwood	Her exertions did not stop here ; for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine , under pretence of fetching Marianne , to leave the others by themselves ; and she really did it , and THAT in the handsomest manner , for she loitered away several minutes on the landing - place , with the most high - minded fortitude , before she went to her sister .
Marianne Dashwood	When that was once done , however , it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease ; for Marianne 's joy hurried her into the drawing - room immediately .
Marianne Dashwood	All that she could hope , was that Edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne 's mistaken warmth , nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting -- and this she had every reason to expect .
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time ; to every inquiry replied that she was better , and tried to prove herself so , by engaging in her accustomary employments .
Marianne Dashwood	But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister 's composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against Marianne inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm . A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings 's advice , of sending for the Palmers ' apothecary .
Marianne Dashwood	"He came , examined his patient , and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health , yet , by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency , and allowing the word "" infection "" to pass his lips , gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer , on her baby 's account . Mrs. Jennings , who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne 's complaint more serious than Elinor , now looked very grave on Mr. Harris 's report , and confirming Charlotte 's fears and caution , urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant ; and Mr. Palmer , though treating their apprehensions as idle , found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood ."
Marianne Dashwood	Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris 's arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer 's , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.--Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister 's account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c.
Marianne Dashwood	she urged him so strongly to remain , that he , who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance , could not long even affect to demur ; especially as Mrs. Jennings 's entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer , who seemed to feel a relief to himself , in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence .
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne was , of course , kept in ignorance of all these arrangements . She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away , in about seven days from the time of their arrival .
Marianne Dashwood	It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer ; and as it gave her likewise no concern , she never mentioned her name .
Marianne Dashwood	Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer 's departure , and her situation continued , with little variation , the same .
Marianne Dashwood	Mr. Harris , who attended her every day , still talked boldly of a speedy recovery , and Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine ; but the expectation of the others
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings had determined very early in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it , and Colonel Brandon , who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings 's forebodings , was not in a state of mind to resist their influence .
Marianne Dashwood	He tried to reason himself out of fears , which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd ; but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone , were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea , and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more .
Marianne Dashwood	On the morning of the third day however , the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away ; for when Mr. Harris arrived , he declared his patient materially better .
Marianne Dashwood	Her pulse was much stronger , and every symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor , confirmed in every pleasant hope , was all cheerfulness ; rejoicing that in her letters to her mother , she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend 's , in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland ; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel .
Marianne Dashwood	But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.-- Towards the evening Marianne became ill again , growing more heavy , restless , and uncomfortable than before .
Marianne Dashwood	Her sister , however , still sanguine , was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made ; and carefully administering the cordials prescribed , saw her , with satisfaction , sink at last into a slumber , from which she expected the most beneficial effects .
Marianne Dashwood	Her sleep , though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it , lasted a considerable time ; and anxious to observe the result of it herself , she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it . Mrs. Jennings , knowing nothing of any change in the patient , went unusually early to bed ; her maid , who was one of the principal nurses , was recreating herself in the housekeeper 's room , and Elinor remained alone with Marianne .
Marianne Dashwood	"The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed ; and her sister , who watched , with unremitting attention her continual change of posture , and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips , was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber , when Marianne , suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house , started hastily up , and , with feverish wildness , cried out,-- "" Is mama coming?-- "" "" Not yet , "" cried the other , concealing her terror , and assisting Marianne to lie down again , "" but she will be here , I hope , before it is long . It is a great way , you know , from hence to Barton . "" "" But she must not go round by London , "" cried Marianne , in the same hurried manner . "" I shall never see her , if she goes by London . "" Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself , and , while attempting to soothe her , eagerly felt her pulse . It was lower and quicker than ever !"
Marianne Dashwood	and Marianne , still talking wildly of mama , her alarm increased so rapidly , as to determine her on sending instantly for Mr. Harris , and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother .
Marianne Dashwood	To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the latter , was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance ; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister , she hastened down to the drawing - room , where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present . It was no time for hesitation .
Marianne Dashwood	Her fears , he had no courage , no confidence to attempt the removal of:-- he listened to them in silent despondence;--but her difficulties were instantly obviated , for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion , and the service pre - arranged in his mind , he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood .
Marianne Dashwood	It was then about twelve o'clock , and she returned to her sister 's apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary , and to watch by her the rest of the night .
Marianne Dashwood	Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne 's side , and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor 's , before Mr. Harris appeared . Her apprehensions once raised , paid by their excess for all her former security ; and the servant who sat up with her , for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called , only tortured her more , by hints of what her mistress had always thought .
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne 's ideas were still , at intervals , fixed incoherently on her mother , and whenever she mentioned her name , it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor , who , reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness , and wretched for some immediate relief , fancied that all relief might soon be in vain , that every thing had been delayed too long , and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child , or to see her rational .
Marianne Dashwood	His opinion , however , made some little amends for his delay , for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient , he would not allow the danger to be material , and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure , with a confidence which , in a lesser degree , was communicated to Elinor . He promised to call again in the course of three or four hours , and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them .
Marianne Dashwood	With strong concern , and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid , did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed . Her former apprehensions , now with greater reason restored , left her no doubt of the event ; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor , her conviction of her sister 's danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope .
Marianne Dashwood	The rapid decay , the early death of a girl so young , so lovely as Marianne , must have struck a less interested person with concern . On Mrs. Jennings 's compassion she had other claims .
Marianne Dashwood	The distress of her sister too , particularly a favourite , was before her;--and as for their mother , when Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to herself , her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere .
Marianne Dashwood	was unabated ; and Marianne only more quiet -- not more herself -- remained in a heavy stupor .
Marianne Dashwood	But he judged it unnecessary : he had still something more to try , some more fresh application , of whose success he was as confident as the last , and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear , but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood . She was calm , except when she thought of her mother ; but she was almost hopeless ; and in this state she continued till noon , scarcely stirring from her sister 's bed , her thoughts wandering from one image of grief , one suffering friend to another , and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings , who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne 's disappointment had brought on .
Marianne Dashwood	About noon , however , she began -- but with a caution -- a dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent , even to her friend -- to fancy , to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her sister 's pulse;--she waited , watched , and examined it again and again;--and at last , with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness , than all her foregoing distress , ventured to communicate her hopes .
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings , though forced , on examination , to acknowledge a temporary revival , tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;-- and Elinor , conning over every injunction of distrust , told herself likewise not to hope .
Marianne Dashwood	Hope had already entered ; and feeling all its anxious flutter , she bent over her sister to watch -- she hardly knew for what .
Marianne Dashwood	Half an hour passed away , and the favourable symptom yet blessed her .
Marianne Dashwood	Others even arose to confirm it . Her breath , her skin , her lips , all flattered Elinor with signs of amendment ; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her with a rational , though languid , gaze .
Marianne Dashwood	Anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees , and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock;--when his assurances , his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation , gave her confidence , comfort , and tears of joy .
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne was in every respect materially better , and he declared her entirely out of danger . Mrs. Jennings , perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm , allowed herself to trust in his judgment , and admitted , with unfeigned joy , and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness , the probability of an entire recovery . Elinor could not be cheerful . Her joy was of a different kind , and led to any thing rather than to gaiety .
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne restored to life , health , friends , and to her doting mother , was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort , and expand it in fervent gratitude;-- but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy , no words , no smiles .
Marianne Dashwood	She continued by the side of her sister , with little intermission the whole afternoon , calming every fear , satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits , supplying every succour , and watching almost every look and every breath .
Marianne Dashwood	The possibility of a relapse would of course , in some moments , occur to remind her of what anxiety was-- but when she saw , on her frequent and minute examination , that every symptom of recovery continued , and saw Marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet , steady , and to all appearance comfortable , sleep , she silenced every doubt .
Marianne Dashwood	At seven o'clock , leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep , she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing - room to tea .
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her , at its conclusion , to take some rest before her mother 's arrival , and allow HER to take her place by Marianne ; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue , no capability of sleep at that moment about her , and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant .
Marianne Dashwood	The wind roared round the house , and the rain beat against the windows ; but Elinor , all happiness within , regarded it not . Marianne slept through every blast ; and the travellers-- they had a rich reward in store , for every present inconvenience .
Marianne Dashwood	All that remained to be done was to be speedy ; and , therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings 's maid with her sister , she hurried down stairs . The bustle in the vestibule , as she passed along an inner lobby , assured her that they were already in the house . She rushed to the drawing - room,--she entered it,--and saw only Willoughby .
Marianne Dashwood	She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for Marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge .
Marianne Dashwood	When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne , she found her just awaking , refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes .
Marianne Dashwood	The past , the present , the future , Willoughby 's visit , Marianne 's safety , and her mother 's expected arrival , threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue , and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister . Short was the time , however , in which that fear could affect her , for within half an hour after Willoughby 's leaving the house , she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment 's horrible suspense , she ran immediately into the hall , and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it .
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood , whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne 's being no more , had no voice to inquire after her , no voice even for Elinor ; but SHE , waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry , instantly gave the joyful relief;-- and her mother , catching it with all her usual warmth , was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness , as she had been before by her fears .
Marianne Dashwood	She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend;-- and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon 's hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor 's delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;-- but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her . Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night ; and Elinor ,
Marianne Dashwood	She dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower . Then , remembering Colonel Brandon , reproved herself , felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival 's , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby 's death .
Marianne Dashwood	The shock of Colonel Brandon 's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne , that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection .
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne continued to mend every day , and the brilliant cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood 's looks and spirits proved her to be , as she repeatedly declared herself , one of the happiest women in the world . Elinor could not hear the declaration , nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward .
Marianne Dashwood	But Mrs. Dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it . Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her;-- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor .
Marianne Dashwood	"He has told me so himself . "" Her daughter , feeling by turns both pleased and pained , surprised and not surprised , was all silent attention . """
Marianne Dashwood	"And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two . "" Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so , because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age , characters , or feelings , could be given;--but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject , and therefore instead of an inquiry , she passed it off with a smile . """
Marianne Dashwood	I , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal his distress ; I saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy -- or rather , not thinking at all , I suppose -- giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for Marianne .
Marianne Dashwood	He has loved her , my Elinor , ever since the first moment of seeing her .
Marianne Dashwood	""" Here , however , Elinor perceived,--not the language , not the professions of Colonel Brandon , but the natural embellishments of her mother 's active fancy , which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose ."
Marianne Dashwood	as more sincere or constant -- which ever we are to call it-- has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne 's unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!--and without selfishness -- without encouraging a hope!--could he have seen her happy with another -- Such a noble mind!-- such openness , such sincerity!--no one can be deceived in HIM .
Marianne Dashwood	""" His character , however , "" answered Elinor , "" does not rest on ONE act of kindness , to which his affection for Marianne , were humanity out of the case , would have prompted him ."
Marianne Dashwood	"To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him?--Did you allow him to hope ? "" "" Oh !"
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne might at that moment be dying .
Marianne Dashwood	Yet after a time I DID say , for at first I was quite overcome -- that if she lived , as I trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , I have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power .
Marianne Dashwood	Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything;--Marianne 's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.-- His own merits must soon secure it .
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" To judge from the Colonel 's spirits , however , you have not yet made him equally sanguine . "" "" No.--He thinks Marianne 's affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time , and even supposing her heart again free , is too diffident of himself to believe , that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her ."
Marianne Dashwood	There , however , he is quite mistaken .
Marianne Dashwood	"Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness -- often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other . I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be with Colonel Brandon . "" She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree with her , but her dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" At Delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me , "" added Mrs. Dashwood , "" even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation ."
Marianne Dashwood	My affection for Marianne , my thorough conviction of her attachment to me -- it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty , or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches , which I was naturally inclined to feel , and expensive society had increased . I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife , if I chose to address her , and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do . A heavy scene however awaited me , before I could leave Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day ; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement .
Marianne Dashwood	To see Marianne , I felt , would be dreadful , and I even doubted whether I could see her again , and keep to my resolution .
Marianne Dashwood	In that point , however , I undervalued my own magnanimity , as the event declared ; for I went , I saw her , and saw her miserable , and left her miserable -- and left her hoping never to see her again .
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" Why did you call , Mr. Willoughby ? "" said Elinor , reproachfully ; "" a note would have answered every purpose.-- Why was it necessary to call ? "" "" It was necessary to my own pride ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?-- That infamous letter -- Did she shew it you ? "" "" Yes , I saw every note that passed ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" When the first of hers reached me ( as it immediately did , for I was in town the whole time , ) what I felt is-- in the common phrase , not to be expressed ; in a more simple one -- perhaps too simple to raise any emotion-- my feelings were very , very painful.--Every line , every word was -- in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer , were she here , would forbid -- a dagger to my heart ."
Marianne Dashwood	"To know that Marianne was in town was -- in the same language-- a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste , her opinions -- I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure they are dearer . "" Elinor 's heart , which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation , was now softened again;--yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Marianne 's note , by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse ."
Marianne Dashwood	I say awakened , because time and London , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and I had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become
Marianne Dashwood	indifferent to me ;
Marianne Dashwood	I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that I was using her infamously . But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me .
Marianne Dashwood	I sent no answer to Marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street;--but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , I watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name .
Marianne Dashwood	The next morning brought another short note from Marianne-- still affectionate , open , artless , confiding -- everything that could make MY conduct most hateful .
Marianne Dashwood	With my head and heart full of your sister , I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those three or four weeks were worse than all . Well , at last , as I need not tell you , you were forced on me ; and what a sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!-- Marianne , beautiful as an angel on one side , calling me Willoughby in such a tone!--Oh , God!--holding out her hand to me , asking me for an explanation , with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and Sophia , jealous as the devil on the other hand , looking all that was -- Well , it does not signify ; it is over now.-- Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could ; but not before I had seen Marianne 's sweet face as white as death.--THAT was the last , last look I ever had of her;-- the last manner in which she appeared to me .
Marianne Dashwood	It was a horrid sight!--yet when I thought of her to - day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world .
Marianne Dashwood	"She was before me , constantly before me , as I travelled , in the same look and hue . "" A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" We are assured of it . "" "" Your poor mother , too!--doting on Marianne . "" "" But the letter , Mr. Willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to say about that ?"
Marianne Dashwood	And after all , what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends , in what language my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end .
Marianne Dashwood	Her three notes -- unluckily they were all in my pocketbook , or I should have denied their existence , and hoarded them for ever -- I was forced to put them up , and could not even kiss them .
Marianne Dashwood	suppose it a relief to your own conscience .
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever .
Marianne Dashwood	And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit .
Marianne Dashwood	"how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . "" Here Mrs. Jennings ceased , and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce . Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that Mrs. Jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of Marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it ."
Marianne Dashwood	As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject , Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion .
Marianne Dashwood	going to remove what she really believed to be her sister 's chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and to make Marianne , by a resemblance in their situations , which to HER fancy would seem strong , feel all her own disappointment over again . But unwelcome as such a task must be , it was necessary to be done , and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it .
Marianne Dashwood	She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings , or to represent herself as suffering much , any otherwise than as the self - command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward 's engagement , might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne . Her narration was clear and simple ; and though it could not be given without emotion , it was not accompanied by violent agitation , nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer , for Marianne listened with horror , and cried excessively .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses , no less than in theirs ; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind , and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence , was readily offered . But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither . Edward seemed a second Willoughby ; and acknowledging as Elinor did , that she HAD loved him most sincerely , could she feel less than herself !
Marianne Dashwood	At these words , Marianne 's eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter .
Marianne Dashwood	""" Four months!""--cried Marianne again.--""So calm!-- so cheerful!--how have you been supported?""--"
Marianne Dashwood	""" Marianne seemed much struck ."
Marianne Dashwood	"Lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--And after all , Marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one 's happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant -- it is not fit -- it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edward will marry Lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER.""-- "" If such is your way of thinking , "" said Marianne , "" if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else , your resolution , your self - command , are , perhaps , a little less to be wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For four months , Marianne , I have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as I thought , with triumph.-- This person 's suspicions , therefore , I have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling -- surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW ."
Marianne Dashwood	"The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that I have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;-- they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No , Marianne.--THEN , if I had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely -- not even what I owed to my dearest friends -- from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy . ""-- Marianne was quite subdued.-- "" Oh !"
Marianne Dashwood	"Elinor , "" she cried , "" you have made me hate myself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!-- you , who have been my only comfort , who have borne with me in all my misery , who have seemed to be only suffering for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I can make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself , I have been trying to do it away . """
Marianne Dashwood	In such a frame of mind as she was now in , Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality.-- These were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make . She performed her promise of being discreet , to admiration.--She
Marianne Dashwood	attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject , with an unchanging complexion , dissented from her in nothing , and was heard
Marianne Dashwood	It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart , that she had asked these young women to her house ; merely because she thought they deserved some attention , were harmless , well - behaved girls , and would be pleasant companions ; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us , while your kind friend there , was attending her daughter .
Marianne Dashwood	"His mother explained to him her liberal designs , in case of his marrying Miss Morton ; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate , which , clear of land - tax , brings in a good thousand a - year ; offered even , when matters grew desperate , to make it twelve hundred ; and in opposition to this , if he still persisted in this low connection , represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match . His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all ; she would never see him again ; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance , that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support , she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it . "" Here Marianne , in an ecstasy of indignation , clapped her hands together , and cried , "" Gracious God !"
Marianne Dashwood	""" Well may you wonder , Marianne , "" replied her brother , "" at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these ."
Marianne Dashwood	""""
Marianne Dashwood	"Marianne was going to retort , but she remembered her promises , and forbore . """
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension ; and Elinor 's heart wrung for the feelings of Edward , while braving his mother 's threats , for a woman who could not reward him .
Marianne Dashwood	"Marianne got up and walked about the room . """
Marianne Dashwood	, he went away ; leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion , as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars 's conduct , the Dashwoods ' , and Edward 's . Marianne 's indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room ; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor , and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings , they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party .
Marianne Dashwood	29 Before the house - maid had lit their fire the next day , or the sun gained any power over a cold , gloomy morning in January , Marianne , only half dressed , was kneeling against one of the window - seats for the sake of all the little light she could command from it , and writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her .
Marianne Dashwood	"In this situation , Elinor , roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs , first perceived her ; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety , said , in a tone of the most considerate gentleness , "" Marianne , may I ask- ?"
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power ; and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more , had not Marianne entreated her , with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability , not to speak to her for the world .
Marianne Dashwood	In such circumstances , it was better for both that they should not be long together ; and the restless state of Marianne 's mind not only prevented her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed , but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place , made her wander about the house till breakfast time , avoiding
Marianne Dashwood	At breakfast she neither ate , nor attempted to eat any thing ; and Elinor 's attention was then all employed , not in urging her , not in pitying her , nor in appearing to regard her , but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jenning 's notice entirely to herself .
Marianne Dashwood	As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings , it lasted a considerable time , and they were just setting themselves , after it , round the common working table , when a letter was delivered to Marianne , which she eagerly caught from the servant , and , turning of a death - like paleness , instantly ran out of the room .
Marianne Dashwood	"Elinor , who saw as plainly by this , as if she had seen the direction , that it must come from Willoughby , felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head , and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jenning 's notice . That good lady , however , saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking . Of Elinor 's distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as Marianne disappeared , she said , "" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature ."
Marianne Dashwood	"I hope , from the bottom of my heart , he wo n't keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn . Pray , when are they to be married ? """
Marianne Dashwood	"Elinor , though never less disposed to speak than at that moment , obliged herself to answer such an attack as this , and , therefore , trying to smile , replied , "" And have you really , Ma'am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister 's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby ?"
Marianne Dashwood	"Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ? Come , come , this wo n't do . Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long . I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte . "" "" Indeed , Ma'am , "" said Elinor , very seriously , "" you are mistaken . Indeed , you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report , and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now ."
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings laughed again , but Elinor had not spirits to say more , and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written , hurried away to their room , where , on opening the door , she saw Marianne stretched on the bed , almost choked by grief , one letter in her hand , and two or three others laying by her . Elinor drew near , but without saying a word ; and seating herself on the bed , took her hand , kissed her affectionately several times , and then gave way to a burst of tears , which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne 's .
Marianne Dashwood	The latter , though unable to speak , seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour , and after some time thus spent in joint affliction , she put all the letters into Elinor 's hands ; and then covering her face with her handkerchief , almost screamed with agony .
Marianne Dashwood	Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever-- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings 's chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed .
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings , with a thoroughly good - humoured concern for its cause , admitted the excuse most readily , and Elinor , after seeing her safe off , returned to Marianne , whom she found attempting to rise from the bed , and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor , faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food ;
Marianne Dashwood	for it was many days since she had any appetite , and many nights since she had really slept ; and now , when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense , the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head , a weakened stomach , and a general nervous faintness .
Marianne Dashwood	"A glass of wine , which Elinor procured for her directly , made her more comfortable , and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness , by saying , "" Poor Elinor ! how unhappy I make you ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I only wish , "" replied her sister , "" there were any thing I COULD do , which might be of comfort to you . "" This , as every thing else would have been , was too much for Marianne , who could only exclaim , in the anguish of her heart , "" Oh !"
Marianne Dashwood	"Elinor , I am miserable , indeed , "" before her voice was entirely lost in sobs ."
Marianne Dashwood	"Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence . "" Exert yourself , dear Marianne , "" she cried , "" if you would not kill yourself and all who love you ."
Marianne Dashwood	Think of your mother ; think of her misery while YOU suffer : for her sake you must exert yourself .
Marianne Dashwood	""" I can not , I can not , "" cried Marianne ; "" leave me , leave me , if I distress you ; leave me , hate me , forget me ! but do not torture me so ."
Marianne Dashwood	Happy , happy Elinor , YOU can not have an idea of what I suffer .
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" Do you call ME happy , Marianne ?"
Marianne Dashwood	"if you knew!--And can you believe me to be so , while I see you so wretched ! "" "" Forgive me , forgive me , "" throwing her arms round her sister 's neck ; "" I know you feel for me ; I know what a heart you have ; but yet you are -- you must be happy ; Edward loves you -- what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ? "" "" Many , many circumstances , "" said Elinor , solemnly ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" No , no , no , "" cried Marianne wildly , "" he loves you , and only you ."
Marianne Dashwood	"You CAN have no grief . "" "" I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" And you will never see me otherwise . Mine is a misery which nothing can do away . "" "" You must not talk so , Marianne ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" Engagement ! "" cried Marianne , "" there has been no engagement ."
Marianne Dashwood	"He has broken no faith with me . "" "" But he told you that he loved you ."
Marianne Dashwood	"Yet you wrote to him?""-- "" Yes -- could that be wrong after all that had passed?-- But I can not talk . """
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor said no more , and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before , directly ran over the contents of all .
Marianne Dashwood	"The first , which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town , was to this effect . Berkeley Street , January . "" How surprised you will be , Willoughby , on receiving this ; and I think you will feel something more than surprise , when you know that I am in town ."
Marianne Dashwood	But her condemnation of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their having been written at all ; and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs of tenderness , not warranted by anything preceding , and most severely condemned by the event , when Marianne , perceiving that she had finished the letters , observed to
Marianne Dashwood	"For a moment or two she could say no more ; but when this emotion had passed away , she added , in a firmer tone , "" Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby . "" "" Dearest Marianne , who but himself ? By whom can he have been instigated ? "" "" By all the world , rather than by his own heart ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Elinor would not contend , and only replied , "" Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy , let them be cheated of their malignant triumph , my dear sister , by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits ."
Marianne Dashwood	"It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence . "" "" No , no , "" cried Marianne , "" misery such as mine has no pride ."
Marianne Dashwood	I care not who knows that I am wretched .
Marianne Dashwood	The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor , Elinor , they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like -- may resist insult , or return mortification -- but I can not .
Marianne Dashwood	"I must feel -- I must be wretched -- and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can . "" "" But for my mother 's sake and mine-- "" "" I would do more than for my own ."
Marianne Dashwood	But to appear happy when I am so miserable -- Oh !
Marianne Dashwood	"Elinor was employed in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window , from the window to the fire , without knowing that she received warmth from one , or discerning objects through the other ; and Marianne , seated at the foot of the bed , with her head leaning against one of its posts , again took up Willoughby 's letter , and , after shuddering over every sentence , exclaimed-- "" It is too much !"
Marianne Dashwood	"Oh , barbarously insolent!--Elinor , can he be justified ? "" "" No , Marianne , in no possible way . "" "" And yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been?--how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh !"
Marianne Dashwood	no one , no one -- he talked to me only of myself .
Marianne Dashwood	Another pause ensued ; Marianne was greatly agitated , and it ended thus .
Marianne Dashwood	""" Elinor , I must go home ."
Marianne Dashwood	I must go and comfort mama . Can not we be gone to - morrow ?
Marianne Dashwood	""" To - morrow , Marianne ! "" "" Yes , why should I stay here ?"
Marianne Dashwood	I came only for Willoughby 's sake -- and now who cares for me ?
Marianne Dashwood	"Who regards me ? """
Marianne Dashwood	"We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility ; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that . "" "" Well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but I can not stay here long , I can not stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people ."
Marianne Dashwood	The Middletons and Palmers -- how am I to bear their pity ?
Marianne Dashwood	From a night of more sleep than she had expected , Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt ; and before breakfast was ready , they had gone through the subject again and again ; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor 's side , the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on Marianne 's , as before .
Marianne Dashwood	Her mother , still confident of their engagement , and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy , had only been roused by Elinor 's application , to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them both ; and this , with such tenderness towards her , such affection for Willoughby , and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other , that she wept with agony through the whole of it . All her impatience to be at home again now returned ; her mother was dearer to her than ever ; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby , and she was wildly urgent to be gone .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor , unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be in London or at Barton , offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother 's wishes could be known ; and at length she obtained her sister 's consent to wait for that knowledge .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor , with a very heavy heart , aware of the pain she was going to communicate , and perceiving , by Marianne 's letter , how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it , then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed , and entreat her directions for the future ; while Marianne , who came into the drawing - room on Mrs. Jennings 's going away , remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote , watching the advancement of her pen , grieving over her for the hardship of such a task , and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother . In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour , when Marianne , whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise , was startled by a rap at the door .
Marianne Dashwood	"Marianne moved to the window-- "" It is Colonel Brandon ! "" said she , with vexation ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" He will not come in , as Mrs. Jennings is from home . "" "" I will not trust to THAT , "" retreating to her own room ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . "" The event proved her conjecture right , though it was founded on injustice and error ; for Colonel Brandon DID come in ; and Elinor , who was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither , and who saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look , and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her , could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly ."
Marianne Dashwood	Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne .
Marianne Dashwood	39 The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town , and Marianne 's impatience to be gone increased every day .
Marianne Dashwood	She sighed for the air , the liberty , the quiet of the country ; and fancied that if any place could give her ease , Barton must do it .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge . She began , however , seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment , and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess , who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good - will , when a plan was suggested , which , though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer , appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other .
Marianne Dashwood	When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious .
Marianne Dashwood	As Marianne 's affection for her mother was sincere , it must triumph with little difficulty , over the imaginary evils she had started .
Marianne Dashwood	"Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother 's concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;-- and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton . "" Ah !"
Marianne Dashwood	""" Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it;-- and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor 's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might NOT hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne 's turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel 's inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house ."
Marianne Dashwood	"They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable , when another lucky stop in Marianne 's performance brought her these words in the Colonel 's calm voice,-- "" I am afraid it can not take place very soon . """
Marianne Dashwood	I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . I suppose Lady Middleton wo n't ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here .
Marianne Dashwood	Remember me kindly to her .
Marianne Dashwood	"me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne , "" I am , & c. """
Marianne Dashwood	47 Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite . She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt;--she was sorry for him;--she wished him happy .
Marianne Dashwood	But the feelings of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken -- a character unblemished , to Marianne .
Marianne Dashwood	Nothing could replace him , therefore , in her former esteem , nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon .
Marianne Dashwood	Had Mrs. Dashwood , like her daughter , heard Willoughby 's story from himself -- had she witnessed his distress , and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner , it is probable that her compassion would have been greater .
Marianne Dashwood	"In the evening , when they were all three together , Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;-- but that it was not without an effort , the restless , unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting -- her rising colour , as she spoke,-- and her unsteady voice , plainly shewed . """
Marianne Dashwood	"I wish to assure you both , "" said she , "" that I see every thing -- as you can desire me to do . """
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness , had not Elinor , who really wished to hear her sister 's unbiased opinion , by an eager sign , engaged her silence .
Marianne Dashwood	"Marianne slowly continued-- "" It is a great relief to me -- what Elinor told me this morning -- I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear ."
Marianne Dashwood	"""--For some moments her voice was lost ; but recovering herself , she added , and with greater calmness than before--""I am now perfectly satisfied , I wish for no change ."
Marianne Dashwood	I never could have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later I must have known , all this.--I should have had no confidence , no esteem .
Marianne Dashwood	Nothing could have done it away to my feelings .
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" I know it -- I know it , "" cried her mother ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Happy with a man of libertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends , and the best of men!--No -- my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience , her sensitive conscience , would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt . """
Marianne Dashwood	"Marianne sighed , and repeated , "" I wish for no change . """
Marianne Dashwood	"Marianne 's lips quivered , and she repeated the word "" Selfish ? "" in a tone that implied--""do you really think him selfish ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I have not a doubt of it , "" said Marianne ; "" and I have nothing to regret -- nothing but my own folly ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Rather say your mother 's imprudence , my child , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ; "" SHE must be answerable . """
Marianne Dashwood	"Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor , satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister 's spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued , "" One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby 's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams ."
Marianne Dashwood	"That crime has been the origin of every lesser one , and of all his present discontents . "" Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark ; and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon 's injuries and merits , warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate . Her daughter did not look , however , as if much of it were heard by her ."
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor , according to her expectation , saw on the two or three following days , that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done ; but while her resolution was unsubdued , and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy , her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health .
Marianne Dashwood	She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London , nothing new of his plans , nothing certain even of his present abode . Some letters had passed between her and her brother , in consequence of Marianne 's illness ; and in the first of John 's , there had been this sentence:--
Marianne Dashwood	"Their man - servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business ; and when , as he waited at table , he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand , this was his voluntary communication-- "" I suppose you know , ma'am , that Mr. Ferrars is married . """
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne gave a violent start , fixed her eyes upon Elinor , saw her turning pale , and fell back in her chair in hysterics .
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood , whose eyes , as she answered the servant 's inquiry , had intuitively taken the same direction , was shocked to perceive by Elinor 's countenance how much she really suffered , and a moment afterwards , alike distressed by Marianne 's situation , knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention .
Marianne Dashwood	The servant , who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill , had sense enough to call one of the maids , who , with Mrs. Dashwood 's assistance , supported her into the other room .
Marianne Dashwood	By that time , Marianne was rather better ,
Marianne Dashwood	and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the maid , returned to Elinor , who , though still much disordered , had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas , as to the source of his intelligence . Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself ; and Elinor
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" I see Mr. Ferrars myself , ma'am , this morning in Exeter , and his lady too , Miss Steele as was ."
Marianne Dashwood	They was stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn , as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother , who is one of the post - boys .
Marianne Dashwood	I happened to look up as I went by the chaise , and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele ; so I took off my hat ,
Marianne Dashwood	"and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma'am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars 's , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they 'd make sure to come and see you . "" "" But did she tell you she was married , Thomas ?"
Marianne Dashwood	She smiled , and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts .
Marianne Dashwood	She was always a very affable and free - spoken young lady , and very civil behaved .
Marianne Dashwood	"So , I made free to wish her joy . "" "" Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her ?"
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor 's heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward ; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation .
Marianne Dashwood	""" They come straight from town , as Miss Lucy-- Mrs. Ferrars told me . "" "" And are they going farther westward ?"
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter ; but Elinor knew better than to expect them .
Marianne Dashwood	She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message , and was very confident that Edward would never come near them .
Marianne Dashwood	"Elinor looked as if she wished to hear more . "" Did you see them off , before you came away ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No , ma'am -- the horses were just coming out , but I could not bide any longer ; I was afraid of being late . "" "" Did Mrs. Ferrars look well ? "" "" Yes , ma'am , she said how she was very well ; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady -- and she seemed vastly contented . "" Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question , and Thomas and the tablecloth , now alike needless , were soon afterwards dismissed ."
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne had already sent to say , that she should eat nothing more .
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood 's and Elinor 's appetites were equally lost , and Margaret might think herself very well off , that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced , so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals , she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before .
Marianne Dashwood	When the dessert and the wine were arranged , and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves , they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence .
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark , and ventured not to offer consolation . She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor 's representation of herself ; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time , to spare her from an increase of unhappiness , suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne .
Marianne Dashwood	She found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wo nt to believe , or than it was now proved to be . She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor;-- that Marianne 's affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self - provocation , and greater fortitude .
Marianne Dashwood	"She paused -- and added in a low voice , "" If I could but know HIS heart , everything would become easy . """
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne said not a word.--She trembled , her eyes were fixed on the ground , and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them . A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart , but she dared not urge one .
Marianne Dashwood	She caught every syllable with panting eagerness ; her hand , unknowingly to herself , closely pressed her sister 's , and tears covered her cheeks .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor , dreading her being tired , led her towards home ; and till they reached the door of the cottage , easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it , talked of nothing but Willoughby , and their conversation together ; and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look , where minuteness could be safely indulged .
Marianne Dashwood	"As soon as they entered the house , Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears , "" Tell mama , "" withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up stairs ."
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought ; and with a mind anxiously pre - arranging its result , and a resolution of reviving the subject again , should Marianne fail to do it , she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting injunction .
Marianne Dashwood	""" But if you write a note to the housekeeper , Mr. Brandon , "" said Marianne , eagerly , "" will it not be sufficient ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" If you would but let us know what your business is , "" said Mrs. Jennings , "" we might see whether it could be put off or not . "" "" You would not be six hours later , "" said Willoughby , "" if you were to defer your journey till our return . "" "" I can not afford to lose ONE hour . ""-- Elinor then heard Willoughby say , in a low voice to Marianne , "" There are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . Brandon is one of them ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" I have no doubt of it , "" replied Marianne ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do . "" To Marianne , he merely bowed and said nothing ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" And who is Miss Williams ? "" asked Marianne ."
Marianne Dashwood	do not you know who Miss Williams is ?
Marianne Dashwood	I am sure you must have heard of her before .
Marianne Dashwood	The carriages were then ordered ; Willoughby 's was first , and Marianne never looked happier than when she got into it .
Marianne Dashwood	"Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor 's right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and Willoughby , and said to Marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , "" I have found you out in spite of all your tricks ."
Marianne Dashwood	"I know where you spent the morning . "" Marianne coloured , and replied very hastily , "" Where , pray?"
Marianne Dashwood	""" -- "" Did not you know , "" said Willoughby , "" that we had been out in my curricle ? "" "" Yes , yes , Mr. Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne . It is a very large one , I know ; and when I come to see you , I hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago . "" Marianne turned away in great confusion ."
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily ; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby 's groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house . Elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose , or Marianne consent , to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was in it , with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance . As soon as they left the dining - room , Elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true .
Marianne Dashwood	""" But , my dear Marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ?"
Marianne Dashwood	I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation .
Marianne Dashwood	I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith 's grounds , or in seeing her house .
Marianne Dashwood	"They will one day be Mr. Willoughby 's , and-- "" "" If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . "" She blushed at this hint ; but it was even visibly gratifying to her ; and after a ten minutes ' interval of earnest thought , she came to her sister again , and said with great good humour , "" Perhaps , Elinor , it WAS rather ill - judged in me to go to Allenham ; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place ; and it is a charming house , I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful ."
Marianne Dashwood	Come , Miss Marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better .
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears .
Marianne Dashwood	Comparisons would occur -- regrets would arise;--and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language . But Elinor -- how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil .
Marianne Dashwood	A three weeks ' residence at Delaford , where , in his evening hours at least , he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty - six and seventeen , brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne 's looks , all the kindness of her welcome , and all the encouragement of her mother 's language , to make it cheerful .
Marianne Dashwood	"He agreed that he might . "" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first . "" He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour.-- "" And if they really DO interest themselves , "" said Marianne , in her new character of candour , "" in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit . "" After a visit on Colonel Brandon 's side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to Delaford , that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on his journey to town ."
Marianne Dashwood	They had in fact nothing to wish for , but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne , and rather better pasturage for their cows .
Marianne Dashwood	""" I will not say that I am disappointed , my dear sister , "" said John , as they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford House , "" THAT would be saying too much , for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world , as it is . But , I confess , it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother . His property here , his place , his house , every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire , as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though , perhaps , Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him-- yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you , for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home , nobody can tell what may happen -- for , when people are much thrown together , and see little of anybody else -- and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage , and so forth;-- in short , you may as well give her a chance -- You understand me . ""--"
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford ; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest , though rather more liberal than what John had expressed .
Marianne Dashwood	Precious as was the company of her daughter to her , she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend ; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion - house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor . They each felt his sorrows , and their own obligations , and Marianne , by general consent , was to be the reward of all . With such a confederacy against her -- with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness -- with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself , which at last , though long after it was observable to everybody else -- burst on her -- what could she do ?
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate .
Marianne Dashwood	She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions , and to counteract , by her conduct , her most favourite maxims . She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen , and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship , voluntarily to give her hand to another!--and THAT other , a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment , whom , two years before , she had considered too old to be married,--and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat ! But so it was .
Marianne Dashwood	Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion , as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,--instead of remaining even for ever with her mother , and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study , as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,-- she found herself at nineteen , submitting to new attachments , entering on new duties , placed in a new home , a wife , the mistress of a family , and the patroness of a village .
Marianne Dashwood	Colonel Brandon was now as happy , as all those who best loved him , believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to animation , and his spirits to cheerfulness ; and that Marianne found her own happiness in forming his , was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend .
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne could never love by halves ; and her whole heart became , in time , as much devoted to her husband , as it had once been to Willoughby . Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang ; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith , who , by stating his marriage with a woman of character , as the source of her clemency
Marianne Dashwood	, gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards Marianne , he might at once have been happy and rich .
Marianne Dashwood	That his repentance of misconduct , which thus brought its own punishment , was sincere , need not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of Colonel Brandon with envy , and of Marianne with regret . But that he was for ever inconsolable , that he fled from society , or contracted an habitual gloom of temper , or died of a broken heart , must not be depended on -- for he did neither . He lived to exert , and frequently to enjoy himself .
Marianne Dashwood	His wife was not always out of humour , nor his home always uncomfortable ; and in his breed of horses and dogs , and in sporting of every kind , he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity . For Marianne , however -- in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss -- he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her , and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;-- and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after - days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon .
Marianne Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage , without attempting a removal to Delaford ; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , when Marianne was taken from them , Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing , and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover .
Marianne Dashwood	Between Barton and Delaford , there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among the merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne , let it not be ranked as the least considerable , that though sisters , and living almost within sight of each other , they could live without disagreement between themselves , or producing coolness between their husbands .
Marianne Dashwood	15 Mrs. Dashwood 's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day , and two of her daughters went with her ; but Marianne excused herself from being of the party , under some trifling pretext of employment ; and her mother , who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent , was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home . On their return from the park they found Willoughby 's curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage , and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just .
Marianne Dashwood	They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction , with her handkerchief at her eyes ; and without noticing them ran up stairs .
Marianne Dashwood	"Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted , where they found only Willoughby , who was leaning against the mantel - piece with his back towards them . He turned round on their coming in , and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over - powered Marianne . "" Is anything the matter with her ? "" cried Mrs. Dashwood as she entered--""is she ill ? "" "" I hope not , "" he replied , trying to look cheerful ; and with a forced smile presently added , "" It is I who may rather expect to be ill -- for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment ! """
Marianne Dashwood	One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side ; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for , though when she considered what Marianne 's love for him was , a quarrel seemed almost impossible . But whatever might be the particulars of their separation , her sister 's affliction was indubitable ; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief , but feeding and encouraging as a duty . In about half an hour her mother returned , and though her eyes were red , her countenance was not uncheerful .
Marianne Dashwood	I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him , ) and on that account is eager to get him away;-- and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him . This is what I believe to have happened . He is , moreover , aware that she DOES disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from Devonshire for a while . You will tell me , I know , that this may or may NOT have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this .
Marianne Dashwood	You had rather look out for misery for Marianne , and guilt for poor Willoughby , than an apology for the latter .
Marianne Dashwood	my dear child , do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment ?
Marianne Dashwood	Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us , for at least the last fortnight , declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife , and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation ? Have we not perfectly understood each other ?
Marianne Dashwood	They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time , when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word .
Marianne Dashwood	Her eyes were red and swollen ; and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty . She avoided the looks of them all , could neither eat nor speak , and after some time , on her mother 's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion , her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome , she burst into tears and left the room .
Marianne Dashwood	She was without any power , because she was without any desire of command over herself .
Marianne Dashwood	The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby overpowered her in an instant ; and though her family were most anxiously attentive to her comfort , it was impossible for them , if they spoke at all , to keep clear of every subject which her feelings connected with him .
Marianne Dashwood	""" "" That is true , "" cried Marianne , in a cheerful voice , and walking to the window as she spoke , to examine the day . "" I had not thought of that ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" At any rate , "" said Elinor , wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister 's thoughts as clearly as she did , "" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" But if she DID , the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact . Whatever the truth of it might be , and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it , yet while she saw Marianne in spirits , she could not be very uncomfortable herself . And Marianne was in spirits ; happy in the mildness of the weather , and still happier in her expectation of a frost ."
Marianne Dashwood	The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs. Jennings 's acquaintance to inform them of her being in town ; and Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind , watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air .
Marianne Dashwood	There seems to me a very decided difference .
Marianne Dashwood	I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff . It was not so yesterday , I think .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor was alternately diverted and pained ; but Marianne persevered , and saw every night in the brightness of the fire , and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere , the certain symptoms
Marianne Dashwood	Colonel Brandon , who had a general invitation to the house , was with them almost every day ; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor , who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence , but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister . She feared it was a strengthening regard .
Marianne Dashwood	It grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne , and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton .
Marianne Dashwood	""" Good God ! "" cried Marianne , "" he has been here while we were out . """
Marianne Dashwood	But Marianne seemed hardly to hear her , and on Mrs. Jenning 's entrance , escaped with the precious card .
Marianne Dashwood	This event , while it raised the spirits of Elinor , restored to those of her sister all , and more than all , their former agitation .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor 's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street during their absence ; but a moment 's glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her , that Willoughby had paid no second visit there .
Marianne Dashwood	"A note was just then brought in , and laid on the table , "" For me ! "" cried Marianne , stepping hastily forward ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" No , ma'am , for my mistress . "" But Marianne , not convinced , took it instantly up ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" You are expecting a letter , then ? "" said Elinor , unable to be longer silent ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" You have no confidence in me , Marianne . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Me ! "" returned Elinor in some confusion ; "" indeed , Marianne , I have nothing to tell ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" Nor I , "" answered Marianne with energy , "" our situations then are alike ."
Marianne Dashwood	"We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing . """
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor , distressed by this charge of reserve in herself , which she was not at liberty to do away , knew not how , under such circumstances , to press for greater openness in Marianne . Mrs. Jennings soon appeared , and the note being given her , she read it aloud .
Marianne Dashwood	The invitation was accepted ; but when the hour of appointment drew near , necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings , that they should both attend her on such a visit , Elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go , for still she had seen nothing of Willoughby ; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad , than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence .
Marianne Dashwood	He looked at them slightly , without seeming to know who they were , and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the room . Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered : it was enough -- HE was not there -- and she sat down , equally ill - disposed to receive or communicate pleasure . After they had been assembled about an hour , Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town , though Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house , and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come .
Marianne Dashwood	""" Did you ? "" replied Elinor ."
Marianne Dashwood	Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life , as she was that evening , and never so much fatigued by the exercise .
Marianne Dashwood	She complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street .
Marianne Dashwood	""" Aye , aye , "" said Mrs. Jennings , "" we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Invited ! "" cried Marianne ."
Marianne Dashwood	""" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . "" Marianne said no more , but looked exceedingly hurt . Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister 's relief , Elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother , and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne , to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed ; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow , that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby , for she could not suppose it to be to any other person . About the middle of the day , Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on business , and Elinor began her letter directly , while Marianne , too restless for employment , too anxious for conversation , walked from one window to the other , or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation ."
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother , relating all that had passed , her suspicions of Willoughby 's inconstancy , urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him . Her letter was scarcely finished , when a rap foretold a visitor , and Colonel Brandon was announced .
Marianne Dashwood	Marianne , who had seen him from the window , and who hated company of any kind , left the room before he entered it .
Marianne Dashwood	He looked more than usually grave , and though expressing satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone , as if he had somewhat in particular to tell her , sat for some time without saying a word .
Marianne Dashwood	Elinor , persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned , impatiently expected its opening .
Marianne Dashwood	"It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction ; for , more than once before , beginning with the observation of "" your sister looks unwell to - day , "" or "" your sister seems out of spirits , "" he had appeared on the point , either of disclosing , or of inquiring , something particular about her . After a pause of several minutes , their silence was broken , by his asking her in a voice of some agitation , when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother ?"
Marianne Dashwood	"He tried to smile as he replied , "" your sister 's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" It can not be generally known , "" returned Elinor , "" for her own family do not know it . "" He looked surprised and said , "" I beg your pardon , I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of ."
Marianne Dashwood	But still I might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister 's writing .
Marianne Dashwood	Excuse me , Miss Dashwood .
Marianne Dashwood	I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence .
Marianne Dashwood	These words , which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister , affected her very much .
Marianne Dashwood	The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known to herself , that in endeavouring to explain it , she might be as liable to say too much as too little .
Marianne Dashwood	Yet as she was convinced that Marianne 's affection for Willoughby , could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon 's success , whatever the event of that affection might be , and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure , she thought it most prudent and kind , after some consideration , to say more than she really knew or believed . She acknowledged , therefore , that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other , of their mutual affection she had no doubt , and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear .
Marianne Dashwood	"He listened to her with silent attention , and on her ceasing to speak , rose directly from his seat , and after saying in a voice of emotion , "" to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her,""--took leave , and went away"
Elinor Dashwood	and the two girls set off together . They gaily ascended the downs , rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky ; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south - westerly wind , they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations .
Elinor Dashwood	The gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . Then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by Margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither Margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour . Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression .
Elinor Dashwood	Had he been even old , ugly , and vulgar , the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child ; but the influence of youth , beauty , and elegance ,
Elinor Dashwood	""" said Elinor ."
Elinor Dashwood	21 The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day , and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain each other . But this did not last long ; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head , had hardly done wondering at Charlotte 's being so happy without a cause , at Mr. Palmer 's acting so simply , with good abilities , and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife , before Sir John 's and Mrs. Jennings 's active zeal in the cause of society , procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe .
Elinor Dashwood	Sir John 's confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise , and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles ' arrival , and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world . From such commendation as this , however , there was not much to be learned ; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of England , under every possible variation of form , face , temper and understanding .
Elinor Dashwood	How can you be so cross as not to come ? Why they are your cousins , you know , after a fashion . YOU are my cousins , and they are my wife 's , so you must be related .
Elinor Dashwood	took place , they found in the appearance of the eldest , who was nearly thirty , with a very plain and not a sensible face , nothing to admire ; but in the other , who was not more than two or three and twenty , they acknowledged considerable beauty ; her features were pretty , and she had a sharp quick eye , and a smartness of air , which though it did not give actual elegance or grace , gave distinction to her person.-- Their manners were particularly civil , and Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense , when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton .
Elinor Dashwood	With her children they were in continual raptures , extolling their beauty , courting their notice , and humouring their whims ; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it , was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing , if she happened to be doing any thing , or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress , in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight .
Elinor Dashwood	She saw their sashes untied , their hair pulled about their ears , their work - bags searched , and their knives and scissors stolen away , and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment . It suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by , without claiming a share in what was passing .
Elinor Dashwood	Marianne was silent ; it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel , however trivial the occasion ; and upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it , always fell .
Elinor Dashwood	She did her best when thus called on , by speaking of Lady Middleton with more warmth than she felt , though with far less than Miss Lucy .
Elinor Dashwood	""" I should guess so , "" said Elinor , with a smile , "" from what I have witnessed this morning ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I have a notion , "" said Lucy , "" you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton ; and for my part , I love to see children full of life and spirits ; I can not bear them if they are tame and quiet . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I confess , "" replied Elinor , "" that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence . """
Elinor Dashwood	In some surprise at the familiarity of this question , or at least of the manner in which it was spoken , Elinor replied that she was .
Elinor Dashwood	""" I think every one MUST admire it , "" replied Elinor , "" who ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" And had you a great many smart beaux there ?"
Elinor Dashwood	I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world ; for my part , I think they are a vast addition always .
Elinor Dashwood	But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux , and had as lief be without them as with them .
Elinor Dashwood	Now there 's Mr. Rose at Exeter , a prodigious smart young man , quite a beau , clerk to Mr. Simpson , you know , and yet if you do but meet him of a morning , he is not fit to be seen.--
Elinor Dashwood	""" Upon my word , "" replied Elinor , "" I can not tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word ."
Elinor Dashwood	But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him .
Elinor Dashwood	Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter , well provided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton , his family , and all his relations , and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins , whom they declared to be the most beautiful , elegant , accomplished , and agreeable girls they had ever beheld , and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.-- And to be better acquainted therefore , Elinor soon found was their inevitable lot , for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles , their party would be too strong for opposition , and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to , which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the same room almost every day .
Elinor Dashwood	To do him justice , he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve , by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins ' situations in the most delicate particulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice , before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister 's having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton .
Elinor Dashwood	""" ' Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure , "" said she , "" and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward , than he had been with respect to Marianne ; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two , as being somewhat newer and more conjectural ; and since Edward 's visit , they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks , as to excite general attention . The letter F-- had been likewise invariably brought forward , and found productive of such countless jokes , that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long established with Elinor ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle 's , it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well . "" Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise ."
Elinor Dashwood	She wished very much to have the subject continued , though she did not chuse to join in it herself ; but nothing more of it was said , and for the first time in her life , she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information , or in a disposition to communicate it .
Elinor Dashwood	The manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward , increased her curiosity ; for it struck her as being rather ill - natured , and suggested the suspicion of that lady 's knowing , or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing , for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars 's name by Miss Steele when alluded to , or even openly mentioned by Sir John .
Elinor Dashwood	Colonel Brandon tell you of it !
Elinor Dashwood	Surely you must be mistaken .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Oh -- he did not say much ; but he looked as if he knew it to be true , so from that moment I set it down as certain ."
Elinor Dashwood	It will be quite delightful , I declare !
Elinor Dashwood	yes , quite well ; and so full of your praises , he did nothing but say fine things of you .
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am flattered by his commendation ."
Elinor Dashwood	"He seems an excellent man ; and I think him uncommonly pleasing . "" "" So do I.--He is such a charming man , that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull ."
Elinor Dashwood	Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was , for he hardly ever falls in love with any body .
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire ? "" said Elinor ."
Elinor Dashwood	yes , extremely well ; that is , I do not believe many people are acquainted with him , because Combe Magna is so far off ; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you .
Elinor Dashwood	Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes , and so you may tell your sister .
Elinor Dashwood	However , I do n't think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night .
Elinor Dashwood	You ca n't think how much I longed to see you !
Elinor Dashwood	""" Grandeur has but little , "" said Elinor , "" but wealth has much to do with it ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Elinor , for shame ! "" said Marianne , "" money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Beyond a competence , it can afford no real satisfaction , as far as mere self is concerned . "" "" Perhaps , "" said Elinor , smiling , "" we may come to the same point ."
Elinor Dashwood	YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ?
Elinor Dashwood	""" We are all unanimous in that wish , I suppose , "" said Elinor , "" in spite of the insufficiency of wealth ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" You must begin your improvements on this house , "" observed Elinor , "" and your difficulties will soon vanish ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes , "" said Elinor , "" in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated ."
Elinor Dashwood	This has always been your doctrine , I am sure .
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility , "" said Edward to Elinor , "" Do you gain no ground ?"
Elinor Dashwood	""" Quite the contrary , "" replied Elinor , looking expressively at Marianne ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" My judgment , "" he returned , "" is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister 's ."
Elinor Dashwood	"I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company , I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility ! "" "" Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers , "" said Elinor ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor looked surprised at his emotion ; but trying to laugh off the subject , she said to him , "" Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ? Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ? "" Edward made no answer ."
Elinor Dashwood	Edward remained a week at the cottage ; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer ; but , as if he were bent only on self - mortification , he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height .
Elinor Dashwood	He valued their kindness beyond any thing , and his greatest happiness was in being with them . Yet , he must leave them at the end of a week , in spite of their wishes and his own , and without any restraint on his time . Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother 's account ; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her , as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son .
Elinor Dashwood	Disappointed , however , and vexed as she was , and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself , she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications , which had been rather more painfully extorted from her , for Willoughby 's service , by her mother . His want of spirits , of openness , and of consistency , were most usually attributed to his want of independence , and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars 's disposition and designs . The shortness of his visit , the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them , originated in the same fettered inclination , the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother . The old well - established grievance of duty against will , parent against child , was the cause of all .
Elinor Dashwood	She would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease , this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed , and her son be at liberty to be happy .
Elinor Dashwood	"But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward 's affection , to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton , and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger . "" I think , Edward , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , as they were at breakfast the last morning , "" you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions ."
Elinor Dashwood	"But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward 's affection , to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton , and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger . "" I think , Edward , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , as they were at breakfast the last morning , "" you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" I do assure you , "" he replied , "" that I have long thought on this point , as you think now ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" The consequence of which , I suppose , will be , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , "" since leisure has not promoted your own happiness , that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits , employments , professions , and trades as Columella 's ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" I think , "" replied Edward , "" that I may defy many months to produce any good to me . "" This desponding turn of mind , though it could not be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood , gave additional pain to them all in the parting , which shortly took place , and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor 's feelings especially , which required some trouble and time to subdue . But as it was her determination to subdue it , and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away , she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne , on a similar occasion , to augment and fix her sorrow , by seeking silence , solitude and idleness ."
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor sat down to her drawing - table as soon as he was out of the house , busily employed herself the whole day , neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name , appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family , and if , by this conduct , she did not lessen her own grief , it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase , and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account .
Elinor Dashwood	Such behaviour as this , so exactly the reverse of her own , appeared no more meritorious to Marianne , than her own had seemed faulty to her . The business of self - command she settled very easily;--with strong affections it was impossible , with calm ones it could have no merit . That her sister 's affections WERE calm , she dared not deny , though she blushed to acknowledge it ; and of the strength of her own , she gave a very striking proof , by still loving and respecting that sister , in spite of this mortifying conviction .
Elinor Dashwood	Without shutting herself up from her family , or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them , or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation , Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of Edward , and of Edward 's behaviour , in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce,--with tenderness , pity , approbation , censure , and doubt . There were moments in abundance , when , if not by the absence of her mother and sisters , at least by the nature of their employments , conversation was forbidden among them , and every effect of solitude was produced .
Elinor Dashwood	Her mind was inevitably at liberty ; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere ; and the past and the future , on a subject so interesting , must be before her , must force her attention , and engross her memory , her reflection , and her fancy .
Elinor Dashwood	From a reverie of this kind , as she sat at her drawing - table
Elinor Dashwood	, she was roused one morning , soon after Edward 's leaving them , by the arrival of company .
Elinor Dashwood	She happened to be quite alone .
Elinor Dashwood	The closing of the little gate , at the entrance of the green court in front of the house , drew her eyes to the window , and she saw a large party walking up to the door .
Elinor Dashwood	"but there were two others , a gentleman and lady , who were quite unknown to her . She was sitting near the window , and as soon as Sir John perceived her , he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door , and stepping across the turf , obliged her to open the casement to speak to him , though the space was so short between the door and the window , as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other . "" Well , "" said he , "" we have brought you some strangers ."
Elinor Dashwood	"How do you like them ? "" "" Hush !"
Elinor Dashwood	"they will hear you . "" "" Never mind if they do ."
Elinor Dashwood	Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you .
Elinor Dashwood	"You may see her if you look this way . "" As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes , without taking that liberty , she begged to be excused ."
Elinor Dashwood	"I see her instrument is open . "" "" She is walking , I believe . """
Elinor Dashwood	How does Mrs. Dashwood do ? And where are your sisters ? What !
Elinor Dashwood	"I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again""-- Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John ."
Elinor Dashwood	( turning to Mrs. Dashwood )
Elinor Dashwood	""" Mr. Palmer made her no answer , and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Mr. Palmer does not hear me , "" said she , laughing ; "" he never does sometimes ."
Elinor Dashwood	This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood ; she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one , and could not help looking with surprise at them both .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings , in the meantime , talked on as loud as she could , and continued her account of their surprise , the evening before , on seeing their friends , without ceasing till every thing was told . Mrs. Palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment , and every body agreed , two or three times over , that it had been quite an agreeable surprise .
Elinor Dashwood	""" You may believe how glad we all were to see them , "" added Mrs. Jennings , leaning forward towards Elinor , and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else , though they were seated on different sides of the room ; "" but , however , I ca n't help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Mrs. Palmer laughed , and said it would not do her any harm . "" She expects to be confined in February , "" continued Mrs. Jennings . Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation , and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in the paper . "" No , none at all , "" he replied , and read on ."
Elinor Dashwood	He immediately went into the passage , opened the front door , and ushered her in himself . Mrs. Jennings asked her , as soon as she appeared , if she had not been to Allenham ; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question , as to show she understood it .
Elinor Dashwood	Do but look , mama , how sweet !
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood , who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage , absolutely refused on her own account ; her daughters might do as they pleased .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties , all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party ; and the young ladies were obliged to yield .
Elinor Dashwood	""" They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now , "" said Elinor , "" by these frequent invitations , than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago ."
Elinor Dashwood	11 Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into Devonshire , that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves , or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment . Yet such was the case .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them . To her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind .
Elinor Dashwood	Her heart was devoted to Willoughby , and the fond attachment to Norland , which she brought with her from Sussex , was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before , by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor 's happiness was not so great .
Elinor Dashwood	Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse .
Elinor Dashwood	Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse .
Elinor Dashwood	She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times ; and had Elinor 's memory been equal to her means of improvement , she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jenning 's last illness , and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died .
Elinor Dashwood	She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times ; and had Elinor 's memory been equal to her means of improvement , she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jenning 's last illness , and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died .
Elinor Dashwood	Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them ; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired .
Elinor Dashwood	"Colonel Brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne , and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister . Elinor 's compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him . This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park , when they were sitting down together by mutual consent , while the others were dancing . His eyes were fixed on Marianne , and , after a silence of some minutes , he said , with a faint smile , "" Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , "" replied Elinor , "" her opinions are all romantic ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist . "" "" I believe she does ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist . "" "" I believe she does ."
Elinor Dashwood	But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , I know not .
Elinor Dashwood	"A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . "" "" This will probably be the case , "" he replied ; "" and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I can not agree with you there , "" said Elinor ."
Elinor Dashwood	Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage .
Elinor Dashwood	"After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,-- "" Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ?"
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" Upon my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment 's being pardonable ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" Upon my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment 's being pardonable ."
Elinor Dashwood	"I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an inforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances""-- Here he stopt suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered Elinor 's head . The lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" In defence of your protege you can even be saucy . "" "" My protege , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , "" replied Elinor , "" and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid ."
Elinor Dashwood	I can only
Elinor Dashwood	pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , I believe , possessing an amiable heart .
Elinor Dashwood	Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness , and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem , she thought she could even now , under the first smart of the heavy blow , command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters .
Elinor Dashwood	And so well was she able to answer her own expectations , that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes , no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters , that Elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love , and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man , of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed , and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house .
Elinor Dashwood	The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne , what had been entrusted in confidence to herself , though it obliged her to unceasing exertion , was no aggravation of Elinor 's distress . On the contrary it was a relief to her , to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them , and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward , which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself , and which was more than she felt equal to support . From their counsel , or their conversation , she knew she could receive no assistance , their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress , while her self - command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise . She was stronger alone , and her own good sense so well supported her , that her firmness was as unshaken , her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable , as with regrets so poignant and so fresh , it was possible for them to be .
Elinor Dashwood	One or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private , when Sir John called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles . Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother 's permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma'am , "" said Elinor , endeavouring to smooth away the offence ; "" and I do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano - forte I ever heard . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You are very kind , "" said Lady Middleton to Elinor ; "" and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ? """
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals , and thus by a little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to practise , gained her own end , and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time .
Elinor Dashwood	Lucy made room for her with ready attention , and the two fair rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table , and , with the utmost harmony , engaged in forwarding the same work .
Elinor Dashwood	It does not do him justice , to be sure , but yet I think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for.--I
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" You are quite in the right , "" replied Elinor calmly ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am sure , "" said she , "" I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I certainly did not seek your confidence , "" said Elinor ; "" but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on ."
Elinor Dashwood	I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance .
Elinor Dashwood	Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward 's mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask .
Elinor Dashwood	Anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for I am in constant fear of her betraying me .
Elinor Dashwood	She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day , when Edward 's name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all .
Elinor Dashwood	You ca n't think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether .
Elinor Dashwood	I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward 's sake these last four years .
Elinor Dashwood	I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Here she took out her handkerchief ; but Elinor did not feel very compassionate ."
Elinor Dashwood	What would you advise me to do in such a case , Miss Dashwood ?
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" Pardon me , "" replied Elinor , startled by the question ; "" but I can give you no advice under such circumstances ."
Elinor Dashwood	Did you not think him dreadful low - spirited when he was at Barton ?
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , "" replied Elinor , most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy 's veracity ; "" I remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth . "" She remembered too , her own surprise at the time , at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends , at his total silence with respect even to their names ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Did not you think him sadly out of spirits ? "" repeated Lucy ."
Elinor Dashwood	"I heard from him just before I left Exeter ; "" taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor ."
Elinor Dashwood	If he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture .
Elinor Dashwood	Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him ?
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" I did , "" said Elinor , with a composure of voice , under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before ."
Elinor Dashwood	41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett 's Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life .
Elinor Dashwood	Her own happiness , and her own spirits , were at least very certain ; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas .
Elinor Dashwood	So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood 's part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued .
Elinor Dashwood	It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street , and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife 's indisposition , beyond one verbal enquiry , Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation , however , which not only opposed her own inclination , but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions .
Elinor Dashwood	, was very urgent to prevent her sister 's going at all ; and Mrs. Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor 's service , so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward 's part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tete - a - tete with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood was denied ; but before the carriage could turn from the house , her husband accidentally came out .
Elinor Dashwood	He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor , told her that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street , and , assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her , invited her to come in .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Fanny is in her own room , I suppose , "" said he:--""I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it , indeed ."
Elinor Dashwood	"NOW especially there can not be -- but however , you and Marianne were always great favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?""--"
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor made what excuse she could for her .
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am not sorry to see you alone , "" he replied , "" for I have a good deal to say to you ."
Elinor Dashwood	"This living of Colonel Brandon's -- can it be true?--has he really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it . "" "" It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward . "" "" Really!--Well , this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no connection between them!--and now that livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Very well -- and for the next presentation to a living of that value -- supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly , and likely to vacate it soon -- he might have got I dare say -- fourteen hundred pounds . And how came he not to have settled that matter before this person 's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it , but a man of Colonel Brandon 's sense!--I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common , such natural , concern!--Well , I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character . I suppose , however -- on recollection -- that the case may probably be THIS ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Elinor contradicted it , however , very positively ; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward , and , therefore , must understand the terms on which it was given , obliged him to submit to her authority ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" It is truly astonishing!""--he cried , after hearing what she said--""what could be the Colonel 's motive ? """
Elinor Dashwood	will not mention the matter to Fanny , however , for though I have broke it to her , and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear it much talked of .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing , that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure , an acquisition of wealth to her brother , by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Mrs. Ferrars , "" added he , lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject , "" knows nothing about it at present , and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.-- When the marriage takes place , I fear she must hear of it all . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" But why should such precaution be used?--Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be quite out of the question ; yet why , upon her late behaviour , is she supposed to feel at all?--She"
Elinor Dashwood	has done with her son , she cast him off for ever , and has made all those over whom she had any influence , cast him off likewise .
Elinor Dashwood	"Surely , after doing so , she can not be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account-- she can not be interested in any thing that befalls him.-- She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child , and yet retain the anxiety of a parent ! """
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor , "" said John , "" your reasoning is very good , but it is founded on ignorance of human nature ."
Elinor Dashwood	When Edward 's unhappy match takes place , depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him ; and , therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event , must be concealed from her as much as possible .
Elinor Dashwood	"Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son . "" "" You surprise me ; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You wrong her exceedingly ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world . "" Elinor was silent ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" We think NOW,""--said Mr. Dashwood , after a short pause , "" of ROBERT 'S marrying Miss Morton . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor , smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother 's tone , calmly replied , "" The lady , I suppose , has no choice in the affair . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Choice!--how do you mean ? "" "" I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert . "" """
Elinor Dashwood	"as to any thing else , they are both very agreeable young men : I do not know that one is superior to the other . "" Elinor said no more , and John was also for a short time silent.--His"
Elinor Dashwood	""" Of ONE thing , my dear sister , "" kindly taking her hand , and speaking in an awful whisper,--""I may assure you;-- and I WILL do it , because I know it must gratify you ."
Elinor Dashwood	I have good reason to think -- indeed I have it from the best authority , or I should not repeat it , for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it -- but I have it from the very best authority -- not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself -- but her daughter DID , and I have it from her -- That in short , whatever objections there might be against a certain -- a certain connection -- you understand me -- it would have been far preferable to her , it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does .
Elinor Dashwood	I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light-- a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all .
Elinor Dashwood	' It would have been beyond comparison , ' she said , ' the least evil of the two , and she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse . '
Elinor Dashwood	But however , all that is quite out of the question -- not to be thought of or mentioned-- as to any attachment you know -- it never could be -- all that is gone by . But I thought I would just tell you of this , because I knew how much it must please you .
Elinor Dashwood	Not that you have any reason to regret , my dear Elinor .
Elinor Dashwood	There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well -- quite as well , or better , perhaps , all things considered .
Elinor Dashwood	"Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately ? "" Elinor had heard enough , if not to gratify her vanity , and raise her self - importance , to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself , and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother , by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars ."
Elinor Dashwood	After a few moments ' chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister 's being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother 's love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother 's integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor repeated the particulars of it , as she had given them to John ; and their effect on Robert , though very different , was not less striking than it had been on HIM . He laughed most immoderately .
Elinor Dashwood	The idea of Edward 's being a clergyman , and living in a small parsonage - house , diverted him beyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice , and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown , he could conceive nothing more ridiculous . Elinor , while she waited in silence and immovable gravity , the conclusion of such folly , could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited . It was a look , however , very well bestowed , for it relieved her own feelings , and gave no intelligence to him . He was recalled from wit to wisdom , not by any reproof of her 's , but by his own sensibility .
Elinor Dashwood	You must not judge of him , Miss Dashwood , from YOUR slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born , you know , with the same powers,--the same address.--
Elinor Dashwood	I could not believe it.-- My mother was the first person who told me of it ; and I , feeling myself called on to act with resolution , immediately said to her , ' My dear madam , I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion , but as for myself , I must say , that if Edward does marry this young woman , I never will see him again . '
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" Have you ever seen the lady ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes ; once , while she was staying in this house , I happened to drop in for ten minutes ; and I saw quite enough of her ."
Elinor Dashwood	The merest awkward country girl , without style , or elegance , and almost without beauty.-- I remember her perfectly .
Elinor Dashwood	I offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late THEN , I found , to do any thing , for unluckily , I was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere .
Elinor Dashwood	"He must be starved , you know;-- that is certain ; absolutely starved . """
Elinor Dashwood	He had just settled this point with great composure , when the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject .
Elinor Dashwood	But though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family , Elinor could see its influence on her mind , in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered , and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself .
Elinor Dashwood	She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room , and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful .
Elinor Dashwood	"For a short time he sat deep in thought , after Elinor had ceased to speak;--at last , and as if it were rather an effort , he said , "" Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability ."
Elinor Dashwood	I have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother I know esteems him highly .
Elinor Dashwood	"He is undoubtedly a sensible man , and in his manners perfectly the gentleman . "" "" Indeed , "" replied Elinor , "" I believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house , ) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Edward made no answer ; but when she had turned away her head , gave her a look so serious , so earnest , so uncheerful , as seemed to say , that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion - house much greater . "" Colonel Brandon , I think , lodges in St. James Street , "" said he , soon afterwards , rising from his chair ."
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor told him the number of the house .
Elinor Dashwood	""" I must hurry away then , to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU ; to assure him that he has made me a very -- an exceedingly happy man ."
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor did not offer to detain him ; and they parted , with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him ; on HIS , with rather an attempt to return the same good will , than the power of expressing it .
Elinor Dashwood	""" When I see him again , "" said Elinor to herself , as the door shut him out , "" I shall see him the husband of Lucy . """
Elinor Dashwood	And with this pleasing anticipation , she sat down to reconsider the past , recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward ; and , of course , to reflect on her own with discontent .
Elinor Dashwood	"When Mrs. Jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared . "" Well , my dear , "" she cried , "" I sent you up to the young man ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty -- You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Really , "" said Elinor , "" I know so little of these kind of forms , that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time , or the preparation necessary ; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination . """
Elinor Dashwood	my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months !
Elinor Dashwood	""" My dear ma'am , "" said Elinor , "" what can you be thinking of?-- Why , Colonel Brandon 's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Lord bless you , my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Aye , aye , the parsonage is but a small one , "" said she , after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over , "" and very likely MAY be out of repair ; but to hear a man apologising , as I thought , for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground - floor , and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!-- and to you too , that had been used to live in Barton cottage!--"
Elinor Dashwood	It seems quite ridiculous . But , my dear , we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before Lucy goes to it .
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living 's being enough to allow them to marry . "" "" The Colonel is a ninny , my dear ; because he has two thousand a - year himself , he thinks that nobody else can marry on less . Take my word for it , that , if I am alive , I shall"
Elinor Dashwood	"I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there . "" Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more ."
Elinor Dashwood	5 No sooner was her answer dispatched , than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son - in - law and his wife that she was provided with a house , and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it .
Elinor Dashwood	They heard her with surprise .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing ; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland .
Elinor Dashwood	"She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily towards her , on hearing this , and , in a voice of surprise and concern , which required no explanation to her , repeated , "" Devonshire !"
Elinor Dashwood	Are you , indeed , going there ?
Elinor Dashwood	She explained the situation .
Elinor Dashwood	""" It is but a cottage , "" she continued , "" but I hope to see many of my friends in it ."
Elinor Dashwood	"A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them . "" She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton ; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection ."
Elinor Dashwood	Though her late conversation with her daughter - in - law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was unavoidable , it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended .
Elinor Dashwood	To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match .
Elinor Dashwood	Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture . He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture was all sent around by water . It chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne 's .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh : she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood 's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own , she should have any handsome article of furniture .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth ; it was ready furnished , and she might have immediate possession .
Elinor Dashwood	No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter . For the comfort of her children , had she consulted only her own wishes , she would have kept it ; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed .
Elinor Dashwood	The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress 's arrival ; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John 's description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own .
Elinor Dashwood	Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter - in - law in the prospect of her removal ; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure . Now was the time when her son - in - law 's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled
Elinor Dashwood	"But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind , and to be convinced , from the general drift of his discourse , that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland . He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away . In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton 's first letter to Norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey . Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved . "" Dear , dear Norland ! "" said Marianne , as she wandered alone before the house , on the last evening of their being there ; "" when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh ! happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And"
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" I shall very soon think him handsome , Elinor , if I do not now ."
Elinor Dashwood	"When you tell me to love him as a brother , I shall no more see imperfection in his face , than I now do in his heart . "" Elinor started at this declaration , and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into , in speaking of him ."
Elinor Dashwood	She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion .
Elinor Dashwood	She believed the regard to be mutual ; but she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne 's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her .
Elinor Dashwood	She knew that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment , they believed the next -- that with them , to wish was to hope , and to hope was to expect . She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister .
Elinor Dashwood	""" I do not attempt to deny , "" said she , "" that I think very highly of him -- that I greatly esteem , that I like him ."
Elinor Dashwood	Cold - hearted Elinor !
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor could not help laughing . "" Excuse me , "" said she ; "" and be assured that I meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings ."
Elinor Dashwood	Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion -- the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly .
Elinor Dashwood	But farther than this you must not believe .
Elinor Dashwood	I am by no means assured of his regard for me .
Elinor Dashwood	There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is .
Elinor Dashwood	In my heart I feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference .
Elinor Dashwood	What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister .
Elinor Dashwood	She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it .
Elinor Dashwood	A doubt of her regard , supposing him to feel it , need not give him more than inquietude .
Elinor Dashwood	A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection . She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present , nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself , without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement .
Elinor Dashwood	With such a knowledge as this , it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject .
Elinor Dashwood	She was far from depending on that result of his preference of her , which her mother and sister still considered as certain . Nay , the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard ; and sometimes , for a few painful minutes , she believed it to be no more than friendship .
Elinor Dashwood	But , whatever might really be its limits , it was enough , when perceived by his sister , to make her uneasy , and at the same time , ( which was still more common , ) to make her uncivil .
Elinor Dashwood	She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother - in - law on the occasion , talking to her so expressively of her brother 's great expectations , of Mrs. Ferrars 's resolution that both her sons should marry well , and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN ; that Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious , nor endeavor to be calm .
Elinor Dashwood	She gave her an answer which marked her contempt , and instantly left the room , resolving that , whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal , her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations . In this state of her spirits , a letter was delivered to her from the post , which contained a proposal particularly well timed . It was the offer of a small house , on very easy terms , belonging to a relation of her own , a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire .
Elinor Dashwood	The letter was from this gentleman himself , and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation . He understood that she was in need of a dwelling ; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage , he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary , if the situation pleased her .
Elinor Dashwood	He earnestly pressed her , after giving the particulars of the house and garden , to come with her daughters to Barton Park , the place of his own residence , from whence she might judge , herself , whether Barton Cottage , for the houses were in the same parish , could , by any alteration , be made comfortable to her .
Elinor Dashwood	He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin ; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections .
Elinor Dashwood	She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry .
Elinor Dashwood	Her resolution was formed as she read .
Elinor Dashwood	To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil ; it was an object of desire ; it was a blessing , in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter - in - law 's guest ; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress .
Elinor Dashwood	She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness , and her acceptance of his proposal ; and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters , that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent . Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland , than immediately amongst their present acquaintance .
Elinor Dashwood	On THAT head , therefore , it was not for her to oppose her mother 's intention of removing into Devonshire .
Elinor Dashwood	The house , too , as described by Sir John , was on so simple a scale , and the rent so uncommonly moderate , as to leave her no right of objection on either point ; and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence .
Elinor Dashwood	After some opposition , Marianne yielded to her sister 's entreaties , and consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an hour .
Elinor Dashwood	She expressly conditioned , however , for paying no visits , and would do no more than accompany them to Gray 's in Sackville Street , where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old - fashioned jewels of her mother .
Elinor Dashwood	All that could be done was , to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession ; one gentleman only was standing there , and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch .
Elinor Dashwood	He was giving orders for a toothpick - case for himself , and till its size , shape , and ornaments were determined , all of which , after examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick - case in the shop , were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy , he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies , than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares ; a kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face , of strong , natural , sterling insignificance , though adorned in the first style of fashion .
Elinor Dashwood	Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment , on this impertinent examination of their features , and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick - cases presented to his inspection , by remaining unconscious of it all ; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself , and be as ignorant of what was passing around her , in Mr. Gray 's shop , as in her own bedroom .
Elinor Dashwood	The ivory , the gold , and the pearls , all received their appointment , and the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick - case , drew on his gloves with leisurely care , and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods , but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration , walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference . Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward , was on the point of concluding it , when another gentleman presented himself at her side . She turned her eyes towards his face , and found him with some surprise to be her brother .
Elinor Dashwood	John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again ; it rather gave them satisfaction ; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days .
Elinor Dashwood	""" I wished very much to call upon you yesterday , "" said he , "" but it was impossible , for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars ."
Elinor Dashwood	THIS morning I had fully intended to call on you , if I could possibly find a spare half hour ,
Elinor Dashwood	but one has always so much to do on first coming to town . I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal .
Elinor Dashwood	But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street , and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings .
Elinor Dashwood	I understand she is a woman of very good fortune .
Elinor Dashwood	And the Middletons too , you must introduce me to THEM .
Elinor Dashwood	"As my mother - in - law 's relations , I shall be happy to show them every respect . They are excellent neighbours to you in the country , I understand . "" "" Excellent indeed ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than I can express . "" "" I am extremely glad to hear it , upon my word ; extremely glad indeed ."
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother ; and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him , by the arrival of Mrs. Jennings 's servant , who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door .
Elinor Dashwood	"His visit was duly paid . He came with a pretence at an apology from their sister - in - law , for not coming too ; "" but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where . """
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her . His manners to THEM , though calm , were perfectly kind ; to Mrs. Jennings , most attentively civil ; and on Colonel Brandon 's coming in soon after himself , he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say , that he only wanted to know him to be rich , to be equally civil to HIM . After staying with them half an hour , he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street , and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton .
Elinor Dashwood	The weather was remarkably fine , and she readily consented .
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" Yes ; he has very good property in Dorsetshire . "" "" I am glad of it ."
Elinor Dashwood	"He seems a most gentlemanlike man ; and I think , Elinor , I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Me , brother !"
Elinor Dashwood	"what do you mean ? "" "" He likes you ."
Elinor Dashwood	I observed him narrowly , and am convinced of it .
Elinor Dashwood	""" I believe about two thousand a year . "" "" Two thousand a - year ; "" and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity , he added , "" Elinor , I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much , for your sake ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Indeed I believe you , "" replied Elinor ; "" but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" You are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken ."
Elinor Dashwood	A very little trouble on your side secures him .
Elinor Dashwood	Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it .
Elinor Dashwood	And there can be no reason why you should not try for him .
Elinor Dashwood	It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side -- in short , you know as to an attachment of that kind , it is quite out of the question , the objections are insurmountable-- you have too much sense not to see all that .
Elinor Dashwood	Colonel Brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family .
Elinor Dashwood	"Recollecting himself , however , he added , "" That is , I mean to say -- your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; Fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , I assure you ."
Elinor Dashwood	"And her mother too , Mrs. Ferrars , a very good - natured woman , I am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day . "" Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer . "" It would be something remarkable , now , "" he continued , "" something droll , if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time . And yet it is not very unlikely . "" "" Is Mr. Edward Ferrars , "" said Elinor , with resolution , "" going to be married ? "" """
Elinor Dashwood	He has a most excellent mother .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Ferrars , with the utmost liberality , will come forward , and settle on him a thousand a year , if the match takes place . The lady is the Hon . Miss Morton , only daughter of the late Lord Morton , with thirty thousand pounds .
Elinor Dashwood	A thousand a - year is a great deal for a mother to give away , to make over for ever ; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit .
Elinor Dashwood	To give you another instance of her liberality:--The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny 's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds .
Elinor Dashwood	"He paused for her assent and compassion ; and she forced herself to say , "" Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable ; but your income is a large one . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Not so large , I dare say , as many people suppose ."
Elinor Dashwood	I do not mean to complain , however ; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one , and I hope will in time be better . The enclosure of Norland Common , now carrying on , is a most serious drain . And then I have made a little purchase within this half year ; East Kingham Farm , you must remember the place , where old Gibson used to live .
Elinor Dashwood	The land was so very desirable for me in every respect , so immediately adjoining my own property , that I felt it my duty to buy it . I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands .
Elinor Dashwood	A man must pay for his convenience ; and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money .
Elinor Dashwood	""" More than you think it really and intrinsically worth . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Why , I hope not that ."
Elinor Dashwood	"I might have sold it again , the next day , for more than I gave : but , with regard to the purchase - money , I might have been very unfortunate indeed ; for the stocks were at that time so low , that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker 's hands , I must have sold out to very great loss . "" Elinor could only smile ."
Elinor Dashwood	Our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland ( and very valuable they were ) to your mother .
Elinor Dashwood	Far be it from me to repine at his doing so ; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose , but , in consequence of it , we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen , china , & c. to supply the place of what was taken away
Elinor Dashwood	"You may guess , after all these expenses , how very far we must be from being rich , and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars 's kindness is . "" "" Certainly , "" said Elinor ; "" and assisted by her liberality , I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances ."
Elinor Dashwood	"It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park , and the flower - garden will slope down just before it , and be exceedingly pretty . We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow . "" Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself ; and was very thankful that Marianne was not present , to share the provocation . Having now said enough to make his poverty clear , and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear - rings for each of his sisters , in his next visit at Gray 's his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn , and he began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings . """
Elinor Dashwood	She seems a most valuable woman indeed -- Her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous.--Her
Elinor Dashwood	inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten.--
Elinor Dashwood	"She must have a great deal to leave . "" "" Nothing at all , I should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Indeed , brother , your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far . "" "" Why , to be sure , "" said he , seeming to recollect himself , "" people have little , have very little in their power ."
Elinor Dashwood	But , my dear Elinor , what is the matter with Marianne?-- she looks very unwell , has lost her colour , and is grown quite thin .
Elinor Dashwood	Is she ill ?
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" She is not well , she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks ."
Elinor Dashwood	At her time of life , any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever !
Elinor Dashwood	Her 's has been a very short one !
Elinor Dashwood	She was as handsome a girl last September , as I ever saw ; and as likely to attract the man .
Elinor Dashwood	There was something in her style of beauty , to please them particularly .
Elinor Dashwood	I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her .
Elinor Dashwood	I question whether Marianne NOW , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a - year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better .
Elinor Dashwood	"I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . "" Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon ; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished , and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman , and promoting the marriage by every possible attention . He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself , to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal ; and an offer from Colonel Brandon , or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings , was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect ."
Elinor Dashwood	They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home , and Sir John came in before their visit ended .
Elinor Dashwood	Sir John was ready to like anybody , and though Mr. Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses , he soon set him down as a very good - natured fellow : while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think
Elinor Dashwood	""" I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny , "" said he , as he walked back with his sister ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman !"
Elinor Dashwood	Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor 's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable.-- She had seen enough of her pride , her meanness , and her determined prejudice against herself , to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement , and retarded the marriage , of Edward and herself , had he been otherwise free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake , that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars 's creation , preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice , or any solicitude for her good opinion .
Elinor Dashwood	Or at least , if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward 's being fettered to Lucy , she determined , that had Lucy been more amiable , she OUGHT to have rejoiced .
Elinor Dashwood	She wondered that Lucy 's spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was NOT ELINOR , appear a compliment to herself -- or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her , because her real situation was unknown .
Elinor Dashwood	But that it was so , had not only been declared by Lucy 's eyes at the time , but was declared over again the next morning more openly , for at her particular desire , Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone , to tell her how happy she was .
Elinor Dashwood	The chance proved a lucky one , for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived , carried Mrs. Jennings away .
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor wished to talk of something else , but Lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness ; and Elinor was obliged to go on.-- "" Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement , "" said she , "" nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was not the case""-- "" I guessed you would say so""--replied Lucy quickly--""but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing ."
Elinor Dashwood	You sha n't talk me out of my satisfaction .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister .
Elinor Dashwood	"They are both delightful women , indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was ! "" To this Elinor had no answer to make , and did not attempt any ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Are you ill , Miss Dashwood?--you seem low -- you do n't speak;--sure you an't well . "" "" I never was in better health . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it ."
Elinor Dashwood	"I should be sorry to have YOU ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship . ""-- Elinor tried to make a civil answer , though doubting her own success ."
Elinor Dashwood	"But it seemed to satisfy Lucy , for she directly replied , "" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward 's love , it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton 's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;-- and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me.--"
Elinor Dashwood	They are such charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her , you can not speak too high .
Elinor Dashwood	But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she SHOULD tell her sister .
Elinor Dashwood	"For where she DOES dislike , I know it is most violent . "" Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph , by the door 's being thrown open , the servant 's announcing Mr. Ferrars , and Edward 's immediately walking in . It was a very awkward moment ; and the countenance of each shewed that it was so . They all looked exceedingly foolish ; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again , as to advance farther into it ."
Elinor Dashwood	But Elinor had more to do ; and so anxious was she , for his sake and her own , to do it well , that she forced herself , after a moment 's recollection , to welcome him , with a look and manner that were almost easy , and almost open ; and another struggle , another effort still improved them .
Elinor Dashwood	She would not allow the presence of Lucy , nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself , to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him , and that she had very much regretted being from home , when he called before in Berkeley Street . She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which , as a friend and almost a relation , were his due , by the observant eyes of Lucy , though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her .
Elinor Dashwood	Her manners gave some re - assurance to Edward , and he had courage enough to sit down ; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion , which the case rendered reasonable , though his sex might make it rare ; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy 's , nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor 's
Elinor Dashwood	.
Elinor Dashwood	Her exertions did not stop here ; for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine , under pretence of fetching Marianne , to leave the others by themselves ; and she really did it , and THAT in the handsomest manner , for she loitered away several minutes on the landing - place , with the most high - minded fortitude , before she went to her sister .
Elinor Dashwood	Her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings , strong in itself , and strongly spoken . She
Elinor Dashwood	met him with a hand that would be taken , and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Dear Edward ! "" she cried , "" this is a moment of great happiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing ? """
Elinor Dashwood	Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved , but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt .
Elinor Dashwood	Again they all sat down , and for a moment or two all were silent ; while Marianne was looking with the most speaking tenderness , sometimes at Edward and sometimes at Elinor , regretting only that their delight in each other should be checked by Lucy 's unwelcome presence .
Elinor Dashwood	"Edward was the first to speak , and it was to notice Marianne 's altered looks , and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her . "" Oh , do n't think of me ! "" she replied with spirited earnestness , though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke , "" do n't think of MY health ."
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor is well , you see .
Elinor Dashwood	"That must be enough for us both . "" This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy , nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy , who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Do you like London ? "" said Edward , willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject ."
Elinor Dashwood	I expected much pleasure in it , but I have found none .
Elinor Dashwood	"She paused -- no one spoke . """
Elinor Dashwood	"I think , Elinor , "" she presently added , "" we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton ."
Elinor Dashwood	In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge .
Elinor Dashwood	But Marianne , who saw his agitation , and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself , was perfectly satisfied ,
Elinor Dashwood	"So dull , so wretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head , which can not be said now . "" And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever , and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother , till they were more in private ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Perhaps , Miss Marianne , "" cried Lucy , eager to take some revenge on her , "" you think young men never stand upon engagements , if they have no mind to keep them , little as well as great ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor was very angry , but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting ; for she calmly replied , "" Not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street ."
Elinor Dashwood	And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure . He is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body I ever saw . Edward , it is so , and I will say it .
Elinor Dashwood	must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation .
Elinor Dashwood	The nature of her commendation , in the present case , however , happened to be particularly ill - suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors , and was so very unexhilarating to Edward , that he very soon got up to go away .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Going so soon ! "" said Marianne ; "" my dear Edward , this must not be ."
Elinor Dashwood	And drawing him a little aside , she whispered her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer .
Elinor Dashwood	""" What can bring her here so often ? "" said Marianne , on her leaving them ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Marianne looked at her steadily , and said , "" You know , Elinor , that this is a kind of talking which I can not bear . If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted , as I must suppose to be the case , you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it . I can not descend to be tricked out of assurances , that are not really wanted ."
Elinor Dashwood	She then left the room ; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more , for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy , she could give no information that would convince Marianne ;
Elinor Dashwood	and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be , she was obliged to submit to it .
Elinor Dashwood	All that she could hope , was that Edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne 's mistaken warmth , nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting -- and this she had every reason to expect .
Elinor Dashwood	But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister 's composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against Marianne inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm . A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings 's advice , of sending for the Palmers ' apothecary .
Elinor Dashwood	"He came , examined his patient , and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health , yet , by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency , and allowing the word "" infection "" to pass his lips , gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer , on her baby 's account . Mrs. Jennings , who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne 's complaint more serious than Elinor , now looked very grave on Mr. Harris 's report , and confirming Charlotte 's fears and caution , urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant ; and Mr. Palmer , though treating their apprehensions as idle , found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood ."
Elinor Dashwood	Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris 's arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer 's , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.--Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister 's account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c.
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , confirmed in every pleasant hope , was all cheerfulness ; rejoicing that in her letters to her mother , she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend 's , in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland ; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel .
Elinor Dashwood	Her sleep , though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it , lasted a considerable time ; and anxious to observe the result of it herself , she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it . Mrs. Jennings , knowing nothing of any change in the patient , went unusually early to bed ; her maid , who was one of the principal nurses , was recreating herself in the housekeeper 's room , and Elinor remained alone with Marianne .
Elinor Dashwood	"The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed ; and her sister , who watched , with unremitting attention her continual change of posture , and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips , was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber , when Marianne , suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house , started hastily up , and , with feverish wildness , cried out,-- "" Is mama coming?-- "" "" Not yet , "" cried the other , concealing her terror , and assisting Marianne to lie down again , "" but she will be here , I hope , before it is long . It is a great way , you know , from hence to Barton . "" "" But she must not go round by London , "" cried Marianne , in the same hurried manner . "" I shall never see her , if she goes by London . "" Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself , and , while attempting to soothe her , eagerly felt her pulse . It was lower and quicker than ever !"
Elinor Dashwood	Her fears , he had no courage , no confidence to attempt the removal of:-- he listened to them in silent despondence;--but her difficulties were instantly obviated , for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion , and the service pre - arranged in his mind , he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome .
Elinor Dashwood	She thanked him with brief , though fervent gratitude , and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris , and an order for post - horses directly , she wrote a few lines to her mother .
Elinor Dashwood	The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon -- or such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully was it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide , whose attendance must relieve , and whose friendship might soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons COULD be lessened to her , his presence , his manners , his assistance , would lessen it .
Elinor Dashwood	HE , meanwhile , whatever he might feel , acted with all the firmness of a collected mind , made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch , and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return .
Elinor Dashwood	The horses arrived , even before they were expected , and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity , and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear , hurried into the carriage .
Elinor Dashwood	Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne 's side , and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor 's , before Mr. Harris appeared . Her apprehensions once raised , paid by their excess for all her former security ; and the servant who sat up with her , for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called , only tortured her more , by hints of what her mistress had always thought .
Elinor Dashwood	Marianne 's ideas were still , at intervals , fixed incoherently on her mother , and whenever she mentioned her name , it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor , who , reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness , and wretched for some immediate relief , fancied that all relief might soon be in vain , that every thing had been delayed too long , and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child , or to see her rational .
Elinor Dashwood	His opinion , however , made some little amends for his delay , for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient , he would not allow the danger to be material , and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure , with a confidence which , in a lesser degree , was communicated to Elinor . He promised to call again in the course of three or four hours , and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them .
Elinor Dashwood	With strong concern , and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid , did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed . Her former apprehensions , now with greater reason restored , left her no doubt of the event ; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor , her conviction of her sister 's danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope .
Elinor Dashwood	Her heart was really grieved .
Elinor Dashwood	The rapid decay , the early death of a girl so young , so lovely as Marianne , must have struck a less interested person with concern . On Mrs. Jennings 's compassion she had other claims .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , catching all , and more than all , his fears in a moment , proposed to call in further advice .
Elinor Dashwood	But he judged it unnecessary : he had still something more to try , some more fresh application , of whose success he was as confident as the last , and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear , but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood . She was calm , except when she thought of her mother ; but she was almost hopeless ; and in this state she continued till noon , scarcely stirring from her sister 's bed , her thoughts wandering from one image of grief , one suffering friend to another , and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings , who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne 's disappointment had brought on .
Elinor Dashwood	Marianne was in every respect materially better , and he declared her entirely out of danger . Mrs. Jennings , perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm , allowed herself to trust in his judgment , and admitted , with unfeigned joy , and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness , the probability of an entire recovery . Elinor could not be cheerful . Her joy was of a different kind , and led to any thing rather than to gaiety .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , for some time after he left her , for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away , remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas , widely differing in themselves , but of which sadness was the general result , to think even of her sister .
Elinor Dashwood	Willoughby , he , whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men
Elinor Dashwood	Willoughby , in spite of all his faults , excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them , which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family , with a tenderness , a regret , rather in proportion ,
Elinor Dashwood	as she soon acknowledged within herself -- to his wishes than to his merits .
Elinor Dashwood	She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for Marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge .
Elinor Dashwood	But she felt that it was so , long , long before she could feel his influence less .
Elinor Dashwood	When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne , she found her just awaking , refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor 's heart was full .
Elinor Dashwood	The past , the present , the future , Willoughby 's visit , Marianne 's safety , and her mother 's expected arrival , threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue , and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister . Short was the time , however , in which that fear could affect her , for within half an hour after Willoughby 's leaving the house , she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment 's horrible suspense , she ran immediately into the hall , and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood , whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne 's being no more , had no voice to inquire after her , no voice even for Elinor ; but SHE , waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry , instantly gave the joyful relief;-- and her mother , catching it with all her usual warmth , was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness , as she had been before by her fears .
Elinor Dashwood	She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend;-- and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon 's hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor 's delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;-- but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her . Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night ; and Elinor ,
Elinor Dashwood	in compliance with her mother 's entreaty , went to bed .
Elinor Dashwood	"Willoughby , "" poor Willoughby , "" as she now allowed herself to call him , was constantly in her thoughts ; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world , and now blamed , now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before ."
Elinor Dashwood	But her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful .
Elinor Dashwood	She dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower . Then , remembering Colonel Brandon , reproved herself , felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival 's , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby 's death .
Elinor Dashwood	The shock of Colonel Brandon 's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne , that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection .
Elinor Dashwood	Marianne continued to mend every day , and the brilliant cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood 's looks and spirits proved her to be , as she repeatedly declared herself , one of the happiest women in the world . Elinor could not hear the declaration , nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward .
Elinor Dashwood	But Mrs. Dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it . Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her;-- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor .
Elinor Dashwood	It was thus imparted to her , as soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred .
Elinor Dashwood	My Elinor , you do not yet know all my happiness .
Elinor Dashwood	Colonel Brandon loves Marianne .
Elinor Dashwood	"He has told me so himself . "" Her daughter , feeling by turns both pleased and pained , surprised and not surprised , was all silent attention . """
Elinor Dashwood	You are never like me , dear Elinor , or I should wonder at your composure now .
Elinor Dashwood	Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family , I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon 's marrying one of you as the object most desirable .
Elinor Dashwood	"And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two . "" Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so , because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age , characters , or feelings , could be given;--but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject , and therefore instead of an inquiry , she passed it off with a smile . """
Elinor Dashwood	It came out quite unawares , quite undesignedly .
Elinor Dashwood	I , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal his distress ; I saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy -- or rather , not thinking at all , I suppose -- giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for Marianne .
Elinor Dashwood	He has loved her , my Elinor , ever since the first moment of seeing her .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Here , however , Elinor perceived,--not the language , not the professions of Colonel Brandon , but the natural embellishments of her mother 's active fancy , which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" His regard for her , infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned , as much more warm ,"
Elinor Dashwood	""" Colonel Brandon 's character , "" said Elinor , "" as an excellent man , is well established ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I know it is""--replied her mother seriously , "" or after such a warning , I should be the last to encourage such affection , or even to be pleased by it . But his coming for me as he did , with such active , such ready friendship , is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" His character , however , "" answered Elinor , "" does not rest on ONE act of kindness , to which his affection for Marianne , were humanity out of the case , would have prompted him ."
Elinor Dashwood	"To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him?--Did you allow him to hope ? "" "" Oh !"
Elinor Dashwood	my love , I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself .
Elinor Dashwood	Marianne might at that moment be dying .
Elinor Dashwood	Yet after a time I DID say , for at first I was quite overcome -- that if she lived , as I trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , I have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power .
Elinor Dashwood	Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything;--Marianne 's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.-- His own merits must soon secure it .
Elinor Dashwood	And his person , his manners too , are all in his favour .
Elinor Dashwood	My partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby -- but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.-- There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby 's eyes at times , which I did not like .
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother , without waiting for her assent , continued , "" And his manners , the Colonel 's manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby 's ever were , but they"
Elinor Dashwood	are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching to Marianne .
Elinor Dashwood	"Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness -- often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other . I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be with Colonel Brandon . "" She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree with her , but her dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" At Delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me , "" added Mrs. Dashwood , "" even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation ."
Elinor Dashwood	Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!--but her spirit was stubborn .
Elinor Dashwood	""" His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , I am sure it must be a good one . """
Elinor Dashwood	Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person , and Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private , to wish success to her friend , and yet in wishing it , to feel a pang for Willoughby .
Elinor Dashwood	In the height of her morality , good woman ! she offered to forgive the past , if I would marry Eliza . That could not be -- and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house .
Elinor Dashwood	The night following this affair -- I was to go the next morning-- was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be .
Elinor Dashwood	My affection for Marianne , my thorough conviction of her attachment to me -- it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty , or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches , which I was naturally inclined to feel , and expensive society had increased . I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife , if I chose to address her , and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do . A heavy scene however awaited me , before I could leave Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day ; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement .
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" Why did you call , Mr. Willoughby ? "" said Elinor , reproachfully ; "" a note would have answered every purpose.-- Why was it necessary to call ? "" "" It was necessary to my own pride ."
Elinor Dashwood	I could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you , or the rest of the neighbourhood , to suspect any part of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself-- and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage , in my way to Honiton .
Elinor Dashwood	The sight of your dear sister , however , was really dreadful ; and , to heighten the matter , I found her alone .
Elinor Dashwood	You were all gone I do not know where .
Elinor Dashwood	I had left her only the evening before , so fully , so firmly resolved within my self on doing right !
Elinor Dashwood	"A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever ; and I remember how happy , how gay were my spirits , as I walked from the cottage to Allenham , satisfied with myself , delighted with every body ! But in this , our last interview of friendship , I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling . Her sorrow , her disappointment , her deep regret , when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately -- I never shall forget it -- united too with such reliance , such confidence in me!--Oh , God!--what a hard - hearted rascal I was ! "" They were both silent for a few moments . Elinor first spoke ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Did you tell her that you should soon return ?"
Elinor Dashwood	""" I do not know what I told her , "" he replied , impatiently ; "" less than was due to the past , beyond a doubt , and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future"
Elinor Dashwood	came your dear mother to torture me farther , with all her kindness and confidence .
Elinor Dashwood	Thank Heaven !
Elinor Dashwood	Miss Dashwood , you can not have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?-- That infamous letter -- Did she shew it you ? "" "" Yes , I saw every note that passed ."
Elinor Dashwood	"To know that Marianne was in town was -- in the same language-- a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste , her opinions -- I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure they are dearer . "" Elinor 's heart , which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation , was now softened again;--yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear . """
Elinor Dashwood	'-- But this note made me know myself better .
Elinor Dashwood	To retreat was impossible .
Elinor Dashwood	I sent no answer to Marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street;--but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , I watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name .
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" Watched us out of the house ! "" "" Even so ."
Elinor Dashwood	You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you , how often I was on the point of falling in with you .
Elinor Dashwood	I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight , as the carriage drove by .
Elinor Dashwood	Lodging as I did in Bond Street , there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you ; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side , a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight , could have separated us so long .
Elinor Dashwood	He asked me to a party , a dance at his house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there , I should have felt it too certain a thing , to trust myself near him .
Elinor Dashwood	But I thought of her , I believe , every moment of the day .
Elinor Dashwood	If you CAN pity me , Miss Dashwood , pity my situation as it was THEN .
Elinor Dashwood	With my head and heart full of your sister , I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those three or four weeks were worse than all . Well , at last , as I need not tell you , you were forced on me ; and what a sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!-- Marianne , beautiful as an angel on one side , calling me Willoughby in such a tone!--Oh , God!--holding out her hand to me , asking me for an explanation , with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and Sophia , jealous as the devil on the other hand , looking all that was -- Well , it does not signify ; it is over now.-- Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could ; but not before I had seen Marianne 's sweet face as white as death.--THAT was the last , last look I ever had of her;-- the last manner in which she appeared to me .
Elinor Dashwood	Your sister is certainly better , certainly out of danger ?
Elinor Dashwood	""" We are assured of it . "" "" Your poor mother , too!--doting on Marianne . "" "" But the letter , Mr. Willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to say about that ?"
Elinor Dashwood	Your sister wrote to me again , you know , the very next morning . You saw what she said .
Elinor Dashwood	I was breakfasting at the Ellisons,--and her letter , with some others , was brought to me there from my lodgings .
Elinor Dashwood	"And , in short -- what do you think of my wife 's style of letter - writing?--delicate -- tender-- truly feminine -- was it not ? "" "" Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand - writing . "" "" Yes , but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to ."
Elinor Dashwood	The original was all her own -- her own happy thoughts and gentle diction . But what could I do!--we were engaged , every thing in preparation , the day almost fixed -- But I am talking like a fool .
Elinor Dashwood	Preparation!--day!--In honest words , her money was necessary to me , and in a situation like mine , any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture .
Elinor Dashwood	Such were my reasonings , as , in a sort of desperate carelessness , I copied my wife 's words , and parted with the last relics of Marianne .
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" You are very wrong , Mr. Willoughby , very blamable , "" said Elinor , while her voice , in spite of herself , betrayed her compassionate emotion ; "" you ought not to speak in this way , either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister ."
Elinor Dashwood	You had made your own choice .
Elinor Dashwood	Your wife has a claim to your politeness , to your respect , at least . She must be attached to you , or she would not have married you .
Elinor Dashwood	To treat her with unkindness , to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne -- nor can I
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" Do not talk to me of my wife , "" said he with a heavy sigh.-- "" She does not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no regard for her when we married.--Well , married we were , and came down to Combe Magna to be happy , and afterwards returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity me , Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?--"
Elinor Dashwood	Am I -- be it only one degree -- am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before?--My intentions were not always wrong .
Elinor Dashwood	"Have I explained away any part of my guilt ? "" "" Yes , you have certainly removed something -- a little.-- You have proved yourself , on the whole , less faulty than I had believed you . You have proved your heart less wicked , much less wicked ."
Elinor Dashwood	But I hardly know -- the misery that you have inflicted -- I hardly know what could have made it worse .
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered , what I have been telling you?--Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours ."
Elinor Dashwood	You tell me that she has forgiven me already .
Elinor Dashwood	Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart , and of my present feelings , will draw from her a more spontaneous , more natural , more gentle , less dignified , forgiveness .
Elinor Dashwood	Tell her of my misery and my penitence -- tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her , and if you will , that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever .
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification ."
Elinor Dashwood	"But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard of her illness . "" "" Last night , in Drury Lane lobby , I ran against Sir John Middleton , and when he saw who I was -- for the first time these two months -- he spoke to me.--That he had cut me ever since my marriage , I had seen without surprise or resentment . Now , however , his good - natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to -- though probably he did not think it WOULD -- vex me horridly . As bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland -- a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent -- the Palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c.--I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John . His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill - will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy ."
Elinor Dashwood	What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying -- and dying too , believing me the greatest villain upon earth , scorning , hating me in her latest moments -- for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed ?
Elinor Dashwood	"ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing-- What I felt was dreadful!--My resolution was soon made , and at eight o'clock this morning I was in my carriage . Now you know all . "" Elinor made no answer ."
Elinor Dashwood	Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness , dissipation , and luxury , had made in the mind , the character , the happiness , of a man who , to every advantage of person and talents , united a disposition naturally open and honest , and a feeling , affectionate temper .
Elinor Dashwood	"The attachment , from which against honour , against feeling , against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself , now , when no longer allowable , governed every thought ; and the connection , for the sake of which he had , with little scruple , left her sister to misery , was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature . From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said-- "" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off . "" "" Are you going back to town ?"
Elinor Dashwood	She could not refuse to give him hers's;--he pressed it with affection .
Elinor Dashwood	""" And you DO think something better of me than you did?""--said he , letting it fall , and leaning against the mantel - piece as if forgetting he was to go ."
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave , pitied , wished him well -- was even interested in his happiness -- and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it .
Elinor Dashwood	If , however , I am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions , it may be the means -- it may put me on my guard -- at least , it may be something to live for .
Elinor Dashwood	"Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again-- "" Elinor stopped him with a reproof ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" What do you mean ? "" "" Your sister 's marriage . "" "" You are very wrong ."
Elinor Dashwood	"She can never be more lost to you than she is now . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" But she will be gained by some one else ."
Elinor Dashwood	And if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , I could least bear -- but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive .
Elinor Dashwood	And with these words , he almost ran out of the room .
Elinor Dashwood	"Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight , that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her ; and , contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day , returned from that period to her own home , and her own habits , in which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share . About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street , Mrs. Jennings , on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer , entered the drawing - room , where Elinor was sitting by herself , with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful ; and giving her time only to form that idea , began directly to justify it , by saying , "" Lord !"
Elinor Dashwood	So upon that , he smirked , and simpered , and looked grave , and seemed to know something or other , and at last he said in a whisper , ' For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister 's indisposition , I think it advisable to say , that I believe there is no great reason for alarm ; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will do very well . '
Elinor Dashwood	Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ) , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There 's for you , my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it
Elinor Dashwood	out directly . Well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;-- till this very morning , poor Nancy , who , you know , is a well - meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out .
Elinor Dashwood	' Lord ! ' thinks she to herself , ' they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ; ' and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet - work , little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord 's daughter or other , I forget who . So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride .
Elinor Dashwood	She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother 's ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing - room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . So up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for Lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on .
Elinor Dashwood	And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit .
Elinor Dashwood	Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes .
Elinor Dashwood	I declare , I have no patience with your sister ; and I hope , with all my heart , it will be a match in spite of her .
Elinor Dashwood	He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care .
Elinor Dashwood	"how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . "" Here Mrs. Jennings ceased , and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce . Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that Mrs. Jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of Marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it ."
Elinor Dashwood	She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was ; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last , than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy .
Elinor Dashwood	What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do , though there could not be a doubt of its nature , she was anxious to hear ; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself .
Elinor Dashwood	For HIM she felt much compassion;-- for Lucy very little -- and it cost her some pains to procure that little;--for the rest of the party none at all .
Elinor Dashwood	As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject , Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion .
Elinor Dashwood	No time was to be lost in undeceiving her , in making her acquainted with the real truth , and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others , without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister , or any resentment against Edward . Elinor 's office was a painful one.--She
Elinor Dashwood	going to remove what she really believed to be her sister 's chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and to make Marianne , by a resemblance in their situations , which to HER fancy would seem strong , feel all her own disappointment over again . But unwelcome as such a task must be , it was necessary to be done , and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it .
Elinor Dashwood	She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings , or to represent herself as suffering much , any otherwise than as the self - command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward 's engagement , might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne . Her narration was clear and simple ; and though it could not be given without emotion , it was not accompanied by violent agitation , nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer , for Marianne listened with horror , and cried excessively .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses , no less than in theirs ; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind , and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence , was readily offered . But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither . Edward seemed a second Willoughby ; and acknowledging as Elinor did , that she HAD loved him most sincerely , could she feel less than herself !
Elinor Dashwood	As for Lucy Steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her . She would not even admit it to have been natural ; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so , by that which only could convince her , a better knowledge of mankind . Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed.--Marianne 's feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment .
Elinor Dashwood	"The first question on her side , which led to farther particulars , was , "" How long has this been known to you , Elinor ? has he written to you ?"
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" I have known it these four months . When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November , she told me in confidence of her engagement . """
Elinor Dashwood	At these words , Marianne 's eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter .
Elinor Dashwood	"After a pause of wonder , she exclaimed-- "" Four months!--Have you known of this four months ? "" Elinor confirmed it ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" What!--while attending me in all my misery , has this been on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!""-- "" It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Four months!""--cried Marianne again.--""So calm!-- so cheerful!--how have you been supported?""--"
Elinor Dashwood	""" By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to Lucy , obliged me to be secret ."
Elinor Dashwood	I owed it to her , therefore , to avoid giving any hint of the truth ; and I owed it to my family and friends , not to create in them a solicitude about me , which it could not be in my power to satisfy .
Elinor Dashwood	""" I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother , "" added Elinor ; "" and once or twice I have attempted it;-- but without betraying my trust , I never could have convinced you . "" "" Four months!--and yet you loved him!""-- "" Yes ."
Elinor Dashwood	But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others was dear to me , I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt . Now , I can think and speak of it with little emotion .
Elinor Dashwood	I would not have you suffer on my account ; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself . I have many things to support me .
Elinor Dashwood	I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own , I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther .
Elinor Dashwood	I acquit Edward of essential misconduct .
Elinor Dashwood	"Lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--And after all , Marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one 's happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant -- it is not fit -- it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edward will marry Lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER.""-- "" If such is your way of thinking , "" said Marianne , "" if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else , your resolution , your self - command , are , perhaps , a little less to be wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For four months , Marianne , I have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as I thought , with triumph.-- This person 's suspicions , therefore , I have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling -- surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW ."
Elinor Dashwood	"The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that I have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;-- they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No , Marianne.--THEN , if I had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely -- not even what I owed to my dearest friends -- from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy . ""-- Marianne was quite subdued.-- "" Oh !"
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor , "" she cried , "" you have made me hate myself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!-- you , who have been my only comfort , who have borne with me in all my misery , who have seemed to be only suffering for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I can make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself , I have been trying to do it away . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor , "" she cried , "" you have made me hate myself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!-- you , who have been my only comfort , who have borne with me in all my misery , who have seemed to be only suffering for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I can make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself , I have been trying to do it away . """
Elinor Dashwood	In such a frame of mind as she was now in , Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality.-- These were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make . She performed her promise of being discreet , to admiration.--She

She performed her promise of being discreet , to admiration.--She
Elinor Dashwood	"""--She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another , and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward 's affection , it cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such"
Elinor Dashwood	advances towards heroism in her sister , made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself .
Elinor Dashwood	The next morning brought a farther trial of it , in a visit from their brother , who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair , and bring them news of his wife .
Elinor Dashwood	"Your sister , "" he continued , "" has suffered dreadfully ."
Elinor Dashwood	It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart , that she had asked these young women to her house ; merely because she thought they deserved some attention , were harmless , well - behaved girls , and would be pleasant companions ; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us , while your kind friend there , was attending her daughter .
Elinor Dashwood	"I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . """
Elinor Dashwood	"It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns . "" Elinor 's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward , though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it ."
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence .
Elinor Dashwood	She had an excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate , and her feelings were strong ; but she knew how to govern them : it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn ; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught .
Elinor Dashwood	Marianne 's abilities were , in many respects , quite equal to Elinor 's .
Elinor Dashwood	She was sensible and clever ; but eager in everything : her sorrows , her joys , could have no moderation .
Elinor Dashwood	She was generous , amiable , interesting : she was everything but prudent .
Elinor Dashwood	The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor saw , with concern , the excess of her sister 's sensibility ; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , too , was deeply afflicted ; but still she could struggle , she could exert herself .
Elinor Dashwood	She could consult with her brother , could receive her sister - in - law on her arrival , and treat her with proper attention ; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion , and encourage her to similar forbearance .
Elinor Dashwood	Margaret , the other sister , was a good - humored , well - disposed girl ; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne 's romance , without having much of her sense , she did not , at thirteen , bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life .
Elinor Dashwood	"In this situation , Elinor , roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs , first perceived her ; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety , said , in a tone of the most considerate gentleness , "" Marianne , may I ask- ?"
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" No , Elinor , "" she replied , "" ask nothing ; you will soon know all . """
Elinor Dashwood	The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said , lasted no longer than while she spoke , and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction . It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter , and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her , at intervals , to withhold her pen , were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power ; and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more , had not Marianne entreated her , with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability , not to speak to her for the world .
Elinor Dashwood	At breakfast she neither ate , nor attempted to eat any thing ; and Elinor 's attention was then all employed , not in urging her , not in pitying her , nor in appearing to regard her , but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jenning 's notice entirely to herself .
Elinor Dashwood	As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings , it lasted a considerable time , and they were just setting themselves , after it , round the common working table , when a letter was delivered to Marianne , which she eagerly caught from the servant , and , turning of a death - like paleness , instantly ran out of the room .
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor , who saw as plainly by this , as if she had seen the direction , that it must come from Willoughby , felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head , and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jenning 's notice . That good lady , however , saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking . Of Elinor 's distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as Marianne disappeared , she said , "" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature ."
Elinor Dashwood	"I hope , from the bottom of my heart , he wo n't keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn . Pray , when are they to be married ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor , though never less disposed to speak than at that moment , obliged herself to answer such an attack as this , and , therefore , trying to smile , replied , "" And have you really , Ma'am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister 's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby ?"
Elinor Dashwood	I thought it had been only a joke , but so serious a question seems to imply more ; and I must beg , therefore , that you will not deceive yourself any longer .
Elinor Dashwood	"I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married . "" "" For shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood !"
Elinor Dashwood	how can you talk so ?
Elinor Dashwood	"Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ? Come , come , this wo n't do . Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long . I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte . "" "" Indeed , Ma'am , "" said Elinor , very seriously , "" you are mistaken . Indeed , you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report , and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ?

Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings laughed again , but Elinor had not spirits to say more , and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written , hurried away to their room , where , on opening the door , she saw Marianne stretched on the bed , almost choked by grief , one letter in her hand , and two or three others laying by her . Elinor drew near , but without saying a word ; and seating herself on the bed , took her hand , kissed her affectionately several times , and then gave way to a burst of tears , which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne 's .

Elinor Dashwood	The latter , though unable to speak , seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour , and after some time thus spent in joint affliction , she put all the letters into Elinor 's hands ; and then covering her face with her handkerchief , almost screamed with agony .
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor , who knew that such grief , shocking as it was to witness it , must have its course , watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself , and then turning eagerly to Willoughby 's letter , read as follows : "" Bond Street , January . "" MY DEAR MADAM , "" I have just had the honour of receiving your letter , for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments ."

"" MY DEAR MADAM , "" I have just had the honour of receiving your letter , for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments ."
Elinor Dashwood	Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever-- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings 's chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed .

Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings , with a thoroughly good - humoured concern for its cause , admitted the excuse most readily , and Elinor , after seeing her safe off , returned to Marianne , whom she found attempting to rise from the bed , and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor , faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food ;
Elinor Dashwood	"A glass of wine , which Elinor procured for her directly , made her more comfortable , and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness , by saying , "" Poor Elinor ! how unhappy I make you ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I only wish , "" replied her sister , "" there were any thing I COULD do , which might be of comfort to you . "" This , as every thing else would have been , was too much for Marianne , who could only exclaim , in the anguish of her heart , "" Oh !"
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor , I am miserable , indeed , "" before her voice was entirely lost in sobs ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence . "" Exert yourself , dear Marianne , "" she cried , "" if you would not kill yourself and all who love you ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I can not , I can not , "" cried Marianne ; "" leave me , leave me , if I distress you ; leave me , hate me , forget me ! but do not torture me so ."
Elinor Dashwood	Happy , happy Elinor , YOU can not have an idea of what I suffer .
Elinor Dashwood	"if you knew!--And can you believe me to be so , while I see you so wretched ! "" "" Forgive me , forgive me , "" throwing her arms round her sister 's neck ; "" I know you feel for me ; I know what a heart you have ; but yet you are -- you must be happy ; Edward loves you -- what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ? "" "" Many , many circumstances , "" said Elinor , solemnly ."

Elinor Dashwood	""" No , no , no , "" cried Marianne wildly , "" he loves you , and only you ."
Elinor Dashwood	"You CAN have no grief . "" "" I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" And you will never see me otherwise . Mine is a misery which nothing can do away . "" "" You must not talk so , Marianne ."
Elinor Dashwood	Have you no comforts ?
Elinor Dashwood	Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation ?
Elinor Dashwood	Much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period-- if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it . Every additional day of unhappy confidence , on your side , would have made the blow more dreadful .
Elinor Dashwood	"Sometimes I thought it had been -- but it never was . "" """
Elinor Dashwood	"The first , which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town , was to this effect . Berkeley Street , January . "" How surprised you will be , Willoughby , on receiving this ; and I think you will feel something more than surprise , when you know that I am in town ."
Elinor Dashwood	At any rate I shall expect you to - morrow .
Elinor Dashwood	"Her second note , which had been written on the morning after the dance at the Middletons ' , was in these words:-- "" I can not express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday , nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week ago . I have been expecting to hear from you , and still more to see you , every hour of the day ."
Elinor Dashwood	You had better come earlier another time , because we are generally out by one .
Elinor Dashwood	I have been told that you were asked to be of the party . But could it be so ?
Elinor Dashwood	You must be very much altered indeed since we parted , if that could be the case , and you not there .
Elinor Dashwood	"But I will not suppose this possible , and I hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise . """
Elinor Dashwood	"The contents of her last note to him were these:-- "" What am I to imagine , Willoughby , by your behaviour last night ?"
Elinor Dashwood	I have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting ; but though I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour , I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it . You have perhaps been misinformed , or purposely deceived , in something concerning me , which may have lowered me in your opinion .
Elinor Dashwood	Tell me what it is , explain the grounds on which you acted , and I shall be satisfied , in being able to satisfy you . It would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you ; but if I am to do it , if I am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you , that your regard for us all was insincere , that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive , let it be told as soon as possible .
Elinor Dashwood	If your sentiments are no longer what they were , you will return my notes , and the lock of my hair which is in your possession .
Elinor Dashwood	That such letters , so full of affection and confidence , could have been so answered , Elinor , for Willoughby 's sake , would have been unwilling to believe .
Elinor Dashwood	But her condemnation of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their having been written at all ; and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs of tenderness , not warranted by anything preceding , and most severely condemned by the event , when Marianne , perceiving that she had finished the letters , observed to
Elinor Dashwood	""" I felt myself , "" she added , "" to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I can believe it , "" said Elinor ; "" but unfortunately he did not feel the same . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" He DID feel the same , Elinor -- for weeks and weeks he felt it ."
Elinor Dashwood	This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment !
Elinor Dashwood	Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton ?
Elinor Dashwood	"For a moment or two she could say no more ; but when this emotion had passed away , she added , in a firmer tone , "" Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby . "" "" Dearest Marianne , who but himself ? By whom can he have been instigated ? "" "" By all the world , rather than by his own heart ."

"" "" Dearest Marianne , who but himself ? By whom can he have been instigated ? "" "" By all the world , rather than by his own heart ."
Elinor Dashwood	Beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby , whose heart I know so well ?
Elinor Dashwood	""" Elinor would not contend , and only replied , "" Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy , let them be cheated of their malignant triumph , my dear sister , by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits ."
Elinor Dashwood	"I must feel -- I must be wretched -- and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can . "" "" But for my mother 's sake and mine-- "" "" I would do more than for my own ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor was employed in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window , from the window to the fire , without knowing that she received warmth from one , or discerning objects through the other ; and Marianne , seated at the foot of the bed , with her head leaning against one of its posts , again took up Willoughby 's letter , and , after shuddering over every sentence , exclaimed-- "" It is too much !"
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , nothing can .
Elinor Dashwood	"Oh , barbarously insolent!--Elinor , can he be justified ? "" "" No , Marianne , in no possible way . "" "" And yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been?--how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh !"
Elinor Dashwood	"Oh , what would HE say to that ! "" Elinor advised her to lie down again , and for a moment she did so ; but no attitude could give her ease ; and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another , till growing more and more hysterical , her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all , and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance ."
Elinor Dashwood	Some lavender drops , however , which she was at length persuaded to take , were of use ; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings returned , she continued on the bed quiet and motionless .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland ;
Elinor Dashwood	But she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease , and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter , whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income , which her mother would have approved .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour , which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections .
Elinor Dashwood	She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself , and she thought of it for her daughters ' sake with satisfaction , though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her in affluence .
Elinor Dashwood	For their brother 's sake , too , for the sake of his own heart , she rejoiced ; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before , in believing him incapable of generosity .
Elinor Dashwood	His attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him , and , for a long time , she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions .
Elinor Dashwood	The contempt which she had , very early in their acquaintance , felt for her daughter - in - law , was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character , which half a year 's residence in her family afforded ; and
Elinor Dashwood	perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former , the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long , had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility , according to the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood , to her daughters ' continuance at Norland .
Elinor Dashwood	This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood , a gentleman - like and pleasing young man , who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister 's establishment at Norland , and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there .
Elinor Dashwood	Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest , for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich ; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence , for , except a trifling sum , the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother .
Elinor Dashwood	But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration .
Elinor Dashwood	It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable , that he loved her daughter , and that Elinor returned the partiality . It was contrary to every doctrine of her 's that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition ; and that Elinor 's merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her , was to her comprehension impossible .
Elinor Dashwood	His understanding was good , and his education had given it solid improvement . But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister , who longed to see him distinguished -- as -- they hardly knew what . They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other . His mother wished to interest him in political concerns , to get him into parliament , or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day . Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise ; but in the mean while , till one of these superior blessings could be attained , it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche .
Elinor Dashwood	Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood 's attention ; for she was , at that time , in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects .
Elinor Dashwood	She saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive , and she liked him for it .
Elinor Dashwood	He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill - timed conversation .
Elinor Dashwood	She was first called to observe and approve him farther , by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister . It was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother .
Elinor Dashwood	""" It is enough , "" said she ; "" to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough ."
Elinor Dashwood	"I love him already . "" "" I think you will like him , "" said Elinor , "" when you know more of him . "" "" Like him ! "" replied her mother with a smile ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love . "" "" You may esteem him ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love . "" Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him . Her manners were attaching , and soon banished his reserve . She speedily comprehended all his merits ; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration ; but she really felt assured of his worth : and even that"
Elinor Dashwood	quietness of manner , which militated against all her established ideas of what a young man 's address ought to be , was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate .
Elinor Dashwood	No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to Elinor , than she considered their serious attachment as certain , and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching .
Elinor Dashwood	""" In a few months , my dear Marianne . "" said she , "" Elinor will , in all probability be settled for life ."
Elinor Dashwood	We shall miss her ; but SHE will be happy .
Elinor Dashwood	"Mamma , how shall we do without her ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" My love , it will be scarcely a separation ."
Elinor Dashwood	You will gain a brother , a real , affectionate brother .
Elinor Dashwood	I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward 's heart .
Elinor Dashwood	"But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister 's choice ? "" "" Perhaps , "" said Marianne , "" I may consider it with some surprise ."
Elinor Dashwood	Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly .
Elinor Dashwood	But yet -- he is not the kind of young man -- there is something wanting -- his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister .
Elinor Dashwood	And besides all this , I am afraid , Mamma , he has no real taste .
Elinor Dashwood	Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor 's drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth .
Elinor Dashwood	It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter .
Elinor Dashwood	To satisfy me , those characters must be united .
Elinor Dashwood	I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own .
Elinor Dashwood	He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both .
Elinor Dashwood	mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward 's manner in reading to us last night !
Elinor Dashwood	I felt for my sister most severely .
Elinor Dashwood	Yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it .
Elinor Dashwood	I could hardly keep my seat .
Elinor Dashwood	"To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference!""-- "" He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose . I thought so at the time ; but you WOULD give him Cowper ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Nay , Mamma , if he is not to be animated by Cowper!-- but we must allow for difference of taste . Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him ."
Elinor Dashwood	But it would have broke MY heart , had I loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility . Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love .
Elinor Dashwood	I require so much !
Elinor Dashwood	"He must have all Edward 's virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm . "" "" Remember , my love , that you are not seventeen ."
Elinor Dashwood	Why should you be less fortunate than your mother ?
Elinor Dashwood	"In one circumstance only , my Marianne , may your destiny be different from her 's ! """
Elinor Dashwood	Do but consider , my dear Mr. Dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother - in - law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a - piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it .
Elinor Dashwood	When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can .
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" Certainly , "" returned Mrs. John Dashwood ."
Elinor Dashwood	When your father and mother moved to Norland , though the furniture of Stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother .
Elinor Dashwood	Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it .
Elinor Dashwood	It gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before ; and he finally resolved , that it would be absolutely unnecessary , if not highly indecorous , to do more for the widow and children of his father , than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out .
Elinor Dashwood	From a night of more sleep than she had expected , Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt ; and before breakfast was ready , they had gone through the subject again and again ; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor 's side , the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on Marianne 's , as before .
Elinor Dashwood	Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself , and at others , lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him .
Elinor Dashwood	At one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world , at another she would seclude herself from it for ever , and at a third could resist it with energy .
Elinor Dashwood	In one thing , however , she was uniform , when it came to the point , in avoiding , where it was possible , the presence of Mrs. Jennings , and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it .
Elinor Dashwood	Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings 's entering into her sorrows with any compassion .
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , no , no , it can not be , "" she cried ; "" she can not feel ."
Elinor Dashwood	All that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because I supply it .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others , by the irritable refinement of her own mind , and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a strong sensibility , and the graces of a polished manner .
Elinor Dashwood	Like half the rest of the world , if more than half there be that are clever and good , Marianne , with excellent abilities and an excellent disposition , was neither reasonable nor candid .
Elinor Dashwood	She expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own , and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself .
Elinor Dashwood	Thus a circumstance occurred , while the sisters were together in their own room after breakfast , which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower in her estimation ; because , through her own weakness , it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself , though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill .
Elinor Dashwood	"With a letter in her outstretched hand , and countenance gaily smiling , from the persuasion of bringing comfort , she entered their room , saying , "" Now , my dear , I bring you something that I am sure will do you good . """
Elinor Dashwood	Marianne heard enough .
Elinor Dashwood	In one moment her imagination placed before her a letter from Willoughby , full of tenderness and contrition , explanatory of all that had passed , satisfactory , convincing ; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself , rushing eagerly into the room to inforce , at her feet , by the eloquence of his eyes , the assurances of his letter . The work of one moment was destroyed by the next .
Elinor Dashwood	The hand writing of her mother , never till then unwelcome , was before her ; and , in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope , she felt as if , till that instant , she had never suffered .
Elinor Dashwood	The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language , within her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence , could have expressed ; and now she could reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence -- a reproach , however , so entirely lost on its object , that after many expressions of pity , she withdrew , still referring her to the letter of comfort .
Elinor Dashwood	But the letter , when she was calm enough to read it , brought little comfort .
Elinor Dashwood	Her mother , still confident of their engagement , and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy , had only been roused by Elinor 's application , to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them both ; and this , with such tenderness towards her , such affection for Willoughby , and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other , that she wept with agony through the whole of it . All her impatience to be at home again now returned ; her mother was dearer to her than ever ; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby , and she was wildly urgent to be gone .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be in London or at Barton , offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother 's wishes could be known ; and at length she obtained her sister 's consent to wait for that knowledge .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual ; for she could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself ; and positively refusing Elinor 's offered attendance , went out alone for the rest of the morning .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , with a very heavy heart , aware of the pain she was going to communicate , and perceiving , by Marianne 's letter , how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it , then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed , and entreat her directions for the future ; while Marianne , who came into the drawing - room on Mrs. Jennings 's going away , remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote , watching the advancement of her pen , grieving over her for the hardship of such a task , and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother . In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour , when Marianne , whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise , was startled by a rap at the door .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Who can this be ? "" cried Elinor ."
Elinor Dashwood	I thought we HAD been safe .
Elinor Dashwood	""" He will not come in , as Mrs. Jennings is from home . "" "" I will not trust to THAT , "" retreating to her own room ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . "" The event proved her conjecture right , though it was founded on injustice and error ; for Colonel Brandon DID come in ; and Elinor , who was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither , and who saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look , and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her , could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street , "" said he , after the first salutation , "" and she encouraged me to come on ; and I was the more easily encouraged , because I thought it probable that I might find you alone , which I was very desirous of doing ."
Elinor Dashwood	My object -- my wish -- my sole wish in desiring it -- I hope , I believe it is -- is to be a means of giving comfort;--no , I must not say comfort -- not present comfort -- but conviction , lasting conviction to your sister 's mind .
Elinor Dashwood	My regard for her , for yourself , for your mother -- will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere regard -- nothing but an earnest desire of being useful -- I think I am justified -- though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right , is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong ?
Elinor Dashwood	""" I understand you , "" said Elinor ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby , that will open his character farther ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" You shall ; and , to be brief , when I quitted Barton last October,--but this will give you no idea -- I must go farther back ."
Elinor Dashwood	You will find me a very awkward narrator , Miss Dashwood ; I hardly know where to begin .
Elinor Dashwood	You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation-- ( it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park -- it was the evening of a dance -- in which I alluded to a lady I had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister Marianne .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Indeed , "" answered Elinor , "" I have NOT forgotten it . """
Elinor Dashwood	I can not remember the time when I did not love Eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt . Her 's , for me , was , I believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate . At seventeen she was lost to me for ever .
Elinor Dashwood	And this , I fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian .
Elinor Dashwood	I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing -- but how blindly I
Elinor Dashwood	relate !
Elinor Dashwood	I have never told you how this was brought on .
Elinor Dashwood	I was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father 's point was gained .
Elinor Dashwood	I had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one--
Elinor Dashwood	but had her marriage been happy , so young as I then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least I should not have now to lament it .
Elinor Dashwood	She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned .
Elinor Dashwood	"Had I remained in England , perhaps -- but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange . The shock which her marriage had given me , "" he continued , in a voice of great agitation , "" was of trifling weight -- was nothing to what I felt when I heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce . It was THAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection of what I suffered-- "" He could say no more , and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room . Elinor , affected by his relation , and still more by his distress , could not speak ."
Elinor Dashwood	He saw her concern , and coming to her , took her hand , pressed it , and kissed it with grateful respect .
Elinor Dashwood	I could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin .
Elinor Dashwood	Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person .
Elinor Dashwood	At last , however , and after I had been six months in England , I DID find her .
Elinor Dashwood	Regard for a former servant of my own , who had since fallen into misfortune , carried me to visit him in a spunging - house , where he was confined for debt ; and there , the same house , under a similar confinement , was my unfortunate sister .
Elinor Dashwood	hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom I had once doted . What I endured in so beholding her -- but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it -- I have pained you too much already .
Elinor Dashwood	That she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was -- yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort . Life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given .
Elinor Dashwood	"I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life : I was with her in her last moments . "" Again he stopped to recover himself ; and Elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern , at the fate of his unfortunate friend ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Your sister , I hope , can not be offended , "" said he , "" by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation ."
Elinor Dashwood	Their fates , their fortunes , can not be the same ; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind , or a happier marriage , she might have been all that you will live to see the other be .
Elinor Dashwood	I seem to have been distressing you for nothing .
Elinor Dashwood	It was a valued , a precious trust to me ; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense , by watching over her education myself , had the nature of our situations allowed it ; but I had no family , no home ; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school .
Elinor Dashwood	I saw her there whenever I could , and after the death of my brother , ( which happened about five years ago , and which left to me the possession of the family property , ) she visited me at Delaford .
Elinor Dashwood	I called her a distant relation ; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her .
Elinor Dashwood	It is now three years ago ( she had just reached her fourteenth year , ) that I removed her from school , to place her under the care of a very respectable woman , residing in Dorsetshire , who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life ; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation .
Elinor Dashwood	I had allowed her , ( imprudently , as it has since turned out , ) at her earnest desire , to go to Bath with one of her young friends , who was attending her father there for his health . I knew him to be a very good sort of man , and I thought well of his daughter -- better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill - judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all .
Elinor Dashwood	He , her father , a well - meaning , but not a quick - sighted man , could really , I believe , give no information ; for he had been generally confined to the house , while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose ; and he tried to convince me , as thoroughly as he was convinced himself , of his daughter 's being entirely unconcerned in the business . In short , I could learn nothing but that she was gone ; all the rest , for eight long months , was left to conjecture .
Elinor Dashwood	What I thought , what I feared , may be imagined ; and what I suffered too .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Good heavens ! "" cried Elinor , "" could it be -- could Willoughby!""-- "" The first news that reached me of her , "" he continued , "" came in a letter from herself , last October ."
Elinor Dashwood	It was forwarded to me from Delaford , and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell ; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly , which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body , and which I believe gave offence to some . Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine , I suppose , when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party , that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable ; but HAD he known it , what would it have availed ?
Elinor Dashwood	Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister ?
Elinor Dashwood	""" His character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both ."
Elinor Dashwood	Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it .
Elinor Dashwood	To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister -- but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister 's influence might yet reclaim him .
Elinor Dashwood	Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self - reproach , which must attend her through life .
Elinor Dashwood	Use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what I have told you .
Elinor Dashwood	You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor 's thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness ; attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to Marianne , from the communication of what had passed .
Elinor Dashwood	""" I have been more pained , "" said she , "" by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Have you , "" she continued , after a short silence , "" ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton ?"
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor , startled by his manner , looked at him anxiously , saying , "" What ? have you met him to-- "" "" I could meet him no other way ."
Elinor Dashwood	Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this ; but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it .
Elinor Dashwood	"No ; as soon as she recovered from her lying - in , for I found her near her delivery , I removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains . "" Recollecting , soon afterwards , that he was probably dividing Elinor from her sister , he put an end to his visit , receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments , and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him ."
Elinor Dashwood	"But your sister does not -- I think you said so -- she does not consider quite as you do ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . "" He made no answer ; and soon afterwards , by the removal of the tea - things , and the arrangement of the card parties , the subject was necessarily dropped ."
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge . She began , however , seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment , and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess , who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good - will , when a plan was suggested , which , though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer , appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other .
Elinor Dashwood	When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Cleveland!""--she cried , with great agitation ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , I can not go to Cleveland ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" You forget , "" said Elinor gently , "" that its situation is not ... that it is not in the neighbourhood of ... "" "" But it is in Somersetshire.--I can not go into Somersetshire.--There , where I looked forward to going ..."
Elinor Dashwood	No , Elinor , you can not expect me to go there .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others;--represented it , therefore , as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother , whom she so much wished to see , in a more eligible , more comfortable manner , than any other plan could do , and perhaps without any greater delay . From Cleveland , which was within a few miles of Bristol , the distance to Barton was not beyond one day , though a long day 's journey ; and their mother 's servant might easily come there to attend them down ; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland , they might now be at home in little more than three weeks ' time .
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother 's concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;-- and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton . "" Ah !"
Elinor Dashwood	""" Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it;-- and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor 's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might NOT hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne 's turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel 's inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house ."

Elinor Dashwood	She wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette . What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest .
Elinor Dashwood	"This delay on the Colonel 's side , however , did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least , for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards , and moving different ways , Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say , and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said , "" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude , and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence , the Colonel should be able to take leave of them , as he immediately did , with the utmost sang - froid , and go away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor . What had really passed between them was to this effect . "" I have heard , "" said he , with great compassion , "" of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?-- "" Elinor told him that it was ."
Elinor Dashwood	I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street , and am much pleased with him . He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , I wish it still more .
Elinor Dashwood	I understand that he intends to take orders .
Elinor Dashwood	Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford , now just vacant , as I am informed by this day 's post , is his , if he think it worth his acceptance -- but THAT , perhaps , so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now , it may be nonsense to appear to doubt ; I only wish it were more valuable.--
Elinor Dashwood	It is a rectory , but a small one ; the late incumbent , I believe , did not make more than 200 L per annum , and though it is certainly capable of improvement , I fear , not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor 's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater , had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand .
Elinor Dashwood	The preferment , which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward , was already provided to enable him to marry;-- and SHE , of all people in the world , was fixed on to bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure , less pleasing , might have a share in that emotion , her esteem for the general benevolence , and her gratitude for the particular friendship , which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act , were strongly felt , and warmly expressed .
Elinor Dashwood	She thanked him for it with all her heart , spoke of Edward 's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve ; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure , if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another . But at the same time , she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself .
Elinor Dashwood	It was an office in short , from which , unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER , she would have been very glad to be spared herself;-- but Colonel Brandon , on motives of equal delicacy , declining it likewise , still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means , that she would not on any account make farther opposition .
Elinor Dashwood	Edward , she believed , was still in town , and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele . She could undertake therefore to inform him of it , in the course of the day .
Elinor Dashwood	After this had been settled , Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour , and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret , that the house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor , as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do , made very light of , at least as far as regarded its size .
Elinor Dashwood	""" The smallness of the house , "" said she , "" I can not imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income . "" By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr. Ferrars 's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation ; for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such an income , as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on-- and he said so ."
Elinor Dashwood	"His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least , I am afraid it can not take place very soon.-- "" Such was the sentence which , when misunderstood , so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings ; but after this narration of what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor , while they stood at the window , the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting , may perhaps appear in general , not less reasonably excited , nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage ."
Elinor Dashwood	( Laughing affectedly.)--No , no ; they were shut up in the drawing - room together , and all I heard was only by listening at the door .
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" How ! "" cried Elinor ; "" have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door ?"
Elinor Dashwood	I am sorry I did not know it before ; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself .
Elinor Dashwood	I only stood at the door , and heard what I could .
Elinor Dashwood	"And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me ; for a year or two back , when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together , she never made any bones of hiding in a closet , or behind a chimney - board , on purpose to hear what we said . "" Elinor tried to talk of something else ; but Miss Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes , from what was uppermost in her mind ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Edward talks of going to Oxford soon , "" said she ; "" but now he is lodging at No . -- , Pall Mall ."
Elinor Dashwood	And your brother and sister were not very kind !
Elinor Dashwood	However , I sha n't say anything against them to YOU ; and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot , which was more than I looked for .
Elinor Dashwood	And for my part , I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before ; but , however , nothing was said about them , and I took care to keep mine out of sight .
Elinor Dashwood	I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious !
Elinor Dashwood	( giggling as she spoke ) I 'd lay my life I know what my cousins will say , when they hear of it .
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" Well , "" said Elinor , "" it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst ."
Elinor Dashwood	"You have got your answer ready . "" Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject , but the approach of her own party made another more necessary ."
Elinor Dashwood	I had a vast deal more to say to you , but I must not stay away from them not any longer .
Elinor Dashwood	I assure you they are very genteel people .
Elinor Dashwood	I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . I suppose Lady Middleton wo n't ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here .
Elinor Dashwood	Remember me kindly to her .
Elinor Dashwood	"if you have not got your spotted muslin on!--I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn . """
Elinor Dashwood	Such was her parting concern ; for after this , she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings , before her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson ; and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time , though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind .
Elinor Dashwood	as she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended , exactly after her expectation , on his getting that preferment , of which , at present , there seemed not the smallest chance .
Elinor Dashwood	As soon as they returned to the carriage , Mrs. Jennings was eager for information ; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that Lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known .
Elinor Dashwood	"The continuance of their engagement , and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end , was all her communication ; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark . "" Wait for his having a living!--ay , we all know how THAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth , and finding no good comes of it , will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a - year , with the interest of his two thousand pounds , and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her.--Then they will have a child every year !"
Elinor Dashwood	how poor they will be!--I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house .
Elinor Dashwood	"Two maids and two men , indeed!--as I talked of t'other day.--No , no , they must get a stout girl of all works.-- Betty 's sister would never do for them NOW . "" The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two - penny post from Lucy herself ."
Elinor Dashwood	I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her ; but I know
Elinor Dashwood	your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward , after all the troubles we have went through lately , therefore will make no more apologies , but proceed
Elinor Dashwood	We have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember , as will Edward too , who I have told of it .
Elinor Dashwood	I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother 's anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and
Elinor Dashwood	should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs. Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr. Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us.--Poor
Elinor Dashwood	Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs. Jennings wo n't think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ' twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper reminds
Elinor Dashwood	"me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne , "" I am , & c. """
Elinor Dashwood	"As soon as Elinor had finished it , she performed what she concluded to be its writer 's real design , by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings , who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise . "" Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye , that was quite proper to let him be off if he would ."
Elinor Dashwood	I wish I COULD get him a living , with all my heart.--She calls me dear Mrs. Jennings , you see .
Elinor Dashwood	She is a good - hearted girl as ever lived.--Very well upon my word .
Elinor Dashwood	Yes , yes , I will go and see her , sure enough .
Elinor Dashwood	How attentive she is , to think of every body!--Thank you , my dear , for shewing it me .
Elinor Dashwood	"It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw , and does Lucy 's head and heart great credit . """
Elinor Dashwood	This would not , in itself , have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself , as , joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy , induced her to accept it with pleasure .
Elinor Dashwood	"Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods;""--was Mrs. Jennings 's address to him when he first called on her , after their leaving her was settled--""for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back!--Lord !"
Elinor Dashwood	I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her ; but I know
Elinor Dashwood	But it was neither in Elinor 's power , nor in her wish , to rouse such feelings in another , by her retailed explanation , as had at first been called forth in herself . Reflection had given calmness to her judgment , and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby 's deserts;-- she wished , therefore , to declare only the simple truth , and lay open such facts as were really due to his character , without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness , had not Elinor , who really wished to hear her sister 's unbiased opinion , by an eager sign , engaged her silence .
Elinor Dashwood	"Marianne slowly continued-- "" It is a great relief to me -- what Elinor told me this morning -- I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" You consider the matter , "" said Elinor , "" exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it ; and I dare say you perceive , as well as myself , not only in this , but in many other circumstances , reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments , in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection , on his side , much less certain ."
Elinor Dashwood	Had you married , you must have been always poor .
Elinor Dashwood	His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self - denial is a word hardly understood by him . His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before .
Elinor Dashwood	"YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you , I know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that-- and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge HIS enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"Marianne 's lips quivered , and she repeated the word "" Selfish ? "" in a tone that implied--""do you really think him selfish ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" The whole of his behaviour , "" replied Elinor , "" from the beginning to the end of the affair , has been grounded on selfishness ."
Elinor Dashwood	It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections ; which afterwards , when his own were engaged , made him delay the confession of it , and which finally carried him from Barton .
Elinor Dashwood	"MY happiness never was his object . "" "" At present , "" continued Elinor , "" he regrets what he has done ."
Elinor Dashwood	It has not made him happy . His circumstances are now unembarrassed -- he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself . But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have been different .
Elinor Dashwood	"Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor , satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister 's spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued , "" One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby 's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams ."
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , according to her expectation , saw on the two or three following days , that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done ; but while her resolution was unsubdued , and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy , her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health .
Elinor Dashwood	Margaret returned , and the family were again all restored to each other , again quietly settled at the cottage ; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to Barton , at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future . Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward .
Elinor Dashwood	She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London , nothing new of his plans , nothing certain even of his present abode . Some letters had passed between her and her brother , in consequence of Marianne 's illness ; and in the first of John 's , there had been this sentence:--
Elinor Dashwood	""" We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward , and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject , but conclude him to be still at Oxford ; "" which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence , for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters ."
Elinor Dashwood	She was not doomed , however , to be long in ignorance of his measures .
Elinor Dashwood	Marianne gave a violent start , fixed her eyes upon Elinor , saw her turning pale , and fell back in her chair in hysterics .
Elinor Dashwood	and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the maid , returned to Elinor , who , though still much disordered , had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas , as to the source of his intelligence . Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself ; and Elinor
Elinor Dashwood	had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it .
Elinor Dashwood	"and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma'am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars 's , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they 'd make sure to come and see you . "" "" But did she tell you she was married , Thomas ?"
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor 's heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward ; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter ; but Elinor knew better than to expect them .
Elinor Dashwood	She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message , and was very confident that Edward would never come near them .
Elinor Dashwood	She observed in a low voice , to her mother , that they were probably going down to Mr. Pratt 's , near Plymouth .
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor looked as if she wished to hear more . "" Did you see them off , before you came away ? """
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood 's and Elinor 's appetites were equally lost , and Margaret might think herself very well off , that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced , so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals , she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before .
Elinor Dashwood	When the dessert and the wine were arranged , and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves , they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark , and ventured not to offer consolation . She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor 's representation of herself ; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time , to spare her from an increase of unhappiness , suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne .
Elinor Dashwood	She found that she had been misled by the careful , the considerate attention of her daughter , to think the attachment , which once she had so well understood , much slighter in reality , than she had been wo nt to believe , or than it was now proved to be . She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor;-- that Marianne 's affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self - provocation , and greater fortitude .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration , without feeling at all nearer decision than at first , heard this ; and perceiving that as reflection did nothing , resolution must do all , soon found herself leading to the fact .
Elinor Dashwood	She managed the recital , as she hoped , with address ; prepared her anxious listener with caution ; related simply and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby grounded his apology ; did justice to his repentance , and softened only his protestations of present regard .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , dreading her being tired , led her towards home ; and till they reached the door of the cottage , easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it , talked of nothing but Willoughby , and their conversation together ; and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look , where minuteness could be safely indulged .
Elinor Dashwood	"As soon as they entered the house , Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears , "" Tell mama , "" withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up stairs ."
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought ; and with a mind anxiously pre - arranging its result , and a resolution of reviving the subject again , should Marianne fail to do it , she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting injunction .
Elinor Dashwood	Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected .
Elinor Dashwood	She was prepared to be wet through , fatigued , and frightened ; but the event was still more unfortunate , for they did not go at all .
Elinor Dashwood	""" No bad news , Colonel , I hope ; "" said Mrs. Jennings , as soon as he entered the room ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" None at all , ma'am , I thank you ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Was it from Avignon ? I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , ma'am ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" My dear madam , "" said Lady Middleton , "" recollect what you are saying . "" "" Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married ? "" said Mrs. Jennings , without attending to her daughter 's reproof ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well , then , I know who it is from , Colonel ."
Elinor Dashwood	"And I hope she is well . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Whom do you mean , ma'am ? "" said he , colouring a little ."
Elinor Dashwood	"you know who I mean . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am particularly sorry , ma'am , "" said he , addressing Lady Middleton , "" that I should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" In town ! "" cried Mrs. Jennings ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" My own loss is great , "" be continued , "" in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ; but I am the more concerned , as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" If you would but let us know what your business is , "" said Mrs. Jennings , "" we might see whether it could be put off or not . "" "" You would not be six hours later , "" said Willoughby , "" if you were to defer your journey till our return . "" "" I can not afford to lose ONE hour . ""-- Elinor then heard Willoughby say , in a low voice to Marianne , "" There are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . Brandon is one of them ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" I have no doubt of it , "" replied Marianne ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" There is no persuading you to change your mind , Brandon , I know of old , "" said Sir John , "" when once you are determined on anything . But , however , I hope you will think better of it ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I hope we shall see you at Barton , "" added her ladyship , "" as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" You are very obliging ."
Elinor Dashwood	"he must and shall come back , "" cried Sir John ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" If he is not here by the end of the week , I shall go after him . "" "" Ay , so do , Sir John , "" cried Mrs. Jennings , "" and then perhaps you may find out what his business is ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" You do not go to town on horseback , do you ? "" added Sir John ."
Elinor Dashwood	I shall then go post .
Elinor Dashwood	""" I assure you it is not in my power . """
Elinor Dashwood	Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ?
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am afraid , none at all . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do . "" To Marianne , he merely bowed and said nothing ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Come Colonel , "" said Mrs. Jennings , "" before you go , do let us know what you are going about . """
Elinor Dashwood	He wished her a good morning , and , attended by Sir John , left the room .
Elinor Dashwood	""" I can guess what his business is , however , "" said Mrs. Jennings exultingly ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Can you , ma'am ? "" said almost every body ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes ; it is about Miss Williams , I am sure . """
Elinor Dashwood	I am sure you must have heard of her before .
Elinor Dashwood	She is a relation of the Colonel 's , my dear ; a very near relation .
Elinor Dashwood	We will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Then , lowering her voice a little , she said to Elinor , "" She is his natural daughter . "" "" Indeed ! "" "" Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune . "" When Sir John returned , he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event ; concluding however by observing , that as they were all got together , they must do something by way of being happy ; and after some consultation it was agreed , that although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell , they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country ."
Elinor Dashwood	Some more of the Careys came to dinner , and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table , which Sir John observed with great contentment .
Elinor Dashwood	"Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor 's right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and Willoughby , and said to Marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , "" I have found you out in spite of all your tricks ."
Elinor Dashwood	"I know where you spent the morning . "" Marianne coloured , and replied very hastily , "" Where , pray?"
Elinor Dashwood	""" -- "" Did not you know , "" said Willoughby , "" that we had been out in my curricle ? "" "" Yes , yes , Mr. Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne . It is a very large one , I know ; and when I come to see you , I hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago . "" Marianne turned away in great confusion ."
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily ; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby 's groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house . Elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose , or Marianne consent , to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was in it , with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance . As soon as they left the dining - room , Elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true .
Elinor Dashwood	Marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Why should you imagine , Elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ?"
Elinor Dashwood	"Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby . "" "" Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion ."
Elinor Dashwood	"I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . "" "" I am afraid , "" replied Elinor , "" that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . "" "" On the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , Elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did , I should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" But , my dear Marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ?"
Elinor Dashwood	""" If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives ."
Elinor Dashwood	I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation .
Elinor Dashwood	"They will one day be Mr. Willoughby 's , and-- "" "" If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . "" She blushed at this hint ; but it was even visibly gratifying to her ; and after a ten minutes ' interval of earnest thought , she came to her sister again , and said with great good humour , "" Perhaps , Elinor , it WAS rather ill - judged in me to go to Allenham ; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place ; and it is a charming house , I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others , she would have described every room in the house with equal delight ."
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , without observing the varying complexion of her sister , and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan , immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both , in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations .
Elinor Dashwood	But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother,--I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence -- Oh !
Elinor Dashwood	"It should not , must not be a struggle . "" Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare them perfectly well ; and Elinor , who now understood her sister , and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again , made no farther direct opposition to the plan , and merely referred it to her mother 's decision , from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit , which she could not approve of for Marianne , and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid . Whatever Marianne was desirous of , her mother would be eager to promote -- she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust ; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London . That Marianne , fastidious as she was , thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings ' manners , and invariably disgusted by them , should overlook every inconvenience of that kind , should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings , in her pursuit of one object , was such a proof , so strong , so full , of the importance of that object to her , as Elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness ."
Elinor Dashwood	"And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . "" "" Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , "" said Elinor , "" you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . "" Marianne 's countenance sunk . "" And what , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , "" is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ?"
Elinor Dashwood	""" That is very true , "" replied her mother , "" but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings , "" said Marianne , "" at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation ."
Elinor Dashwood	"I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . "" Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours . To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy 's account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished . "" I will have you BOTH go , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ; "" these objections are nonsensical ."
Elinor Dashwood	"You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law 's family . "" Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother 's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself , that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed , and now on this attack , though almost hopeless of success , she forced herself to begin her design by saying , as calmly as she could , "" I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . """
Elinor Dashwood	Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment , and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel . With regard to herself , it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not , and
Elinor Dashwood	when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan , and her sister exhilarated by it in look , voice , and manner , restored to all her usual animation , and elevated to more than her usual gaiety , she could not be dissatisfied with the cause , and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence .
Elinor Dashwood	Her mother 's affliction was hardly less , and Elinor was the only one of the three , who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal .
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , "" answered Elinor , with a smile , which concealed very agitated feelings , "" on such a subject I certainly will not ."
Elinor Dashwood	"You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes . "" "" Indeed you wrong me , "" replied Lucy , with great solemnity ; "" I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ' I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , ' I should resolve upon doing it immediately . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward 's future wife , and replied , "" This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one ."
Elinor Dashwood	"It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person . "" "" ' Tis because you are an indifferent person , "" said Lucy , with some pique , and laying a particular stress on those words , "" that your judgment might justly have such weight with me . If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having . "" Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this , lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve ; and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again . Another pause therefore of many minutes ' duration , succeeded this speech , and Lucy was still the first to end it ."
Elinor Dashwood	I had quite depended upon meeting you there .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor was soon called to the card - table by the conclusion of the first rubber , and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end , to which both of them submitted without any reluctance , for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before ; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife ; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage , which sincere affection on HER side would have given , for self - interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement , of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary . From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor , and when entered on by Lucy , who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it , and was particularly careful to inform her confidante , of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward , it was treated by the former with calmness and caution , and dismissed as soon as civility would allow ; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which Lucy did not deserve , and which were dangerous to herself .
Elinor Dashwood	It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;--and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question , it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did , so much in need of encouragement and fresh air .
Elinor Dashwood	This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table at four o'clock , about three hours after his arrival , he had secured his lady , engaged her mother 's consent , and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover , but , in the reality of reason and truth , one of the happiest of men .
Elinor Dashwood	He was brought , not from doubt or suspense , but from misery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine , flowing , grateful cheerfulness , as his friends had never witnessed in him before . His heart was now open to Elinor , all its weaknesses , all its errors confessed , and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty - four .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love Edward , nor praise Elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both .
Elinor Dashwood	Comparisons would occur -- regrets would arise;--and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language . But Elinor -- how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil .
Elinor Dashwood	But when the second moment had passed , when she found every doubt , every solicitude removed , compared her situation with what so lately it had been,--saw him honourably released from his former engagement , saw him instantly profiting by the release , to address herself and declare an affection as tender , as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was oppressed , she was overcome by her own felicity;-- and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better , it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits , or any degree of tranquillity to her heart . Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor 's company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different .
Elinor Dashwood	Lucy 's marriage , the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all , formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and Elinor 's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view , as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard .
Elinor Dashwood	How they could be thrown together , and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,--a girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family -- it was beyond her comprehension to make out .
Elinor Dashwood	To her own heart it was a delightful affair , to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one , but
Elinor Dashwood	to her reason , her judgment , it was completely a puzzle .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street , of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother 's affairs might have done , if applied to in time .
Elinor Dashwood	She repeated it to Edward .
Elinor Dashwood	""" How long it had been carrying on between them , however , he was equally at a loss with herself to make out ; for at Oxford , where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting London , he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself , and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent , nor less affectionate than usual ."
Elinor Dashwood	He put the letter into Elinor 's hands .
Elinor Dashwood	""" DEAR SIR , "" Being very sure I have long lost your affections , I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another , and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you ; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another 's ."
Elinor Dashwood	Sincerely wish you happy in your choice , and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends , as our near relationship now makes proper . I can safely say I owe you no ill - will , and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices .
Elinor Dashwood	"Your brother has gained my affections entirely , and as we could not live without one another , we are just returned from the altar , and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks , which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see , but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines , and shall always remain , "" Your sincere well - wisher , friend , and sister , "" LUCY FERRARS . """
Elinor Dashwood	I have burnt all your letters , and will return your picture the first opportunity .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor read and returned it without any comment .
Elinor Dashwood	""" I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition , "" said Edward.--""For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU in former days.--In a sister it is bad enough , but in a wife!--how I have blushed over"
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" However it may have come about , "" said Elinor , after a pause,--""they are certainly married ."
Elinor Dashwood	And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment .
Elinor Dashwood	The independence she settled on Robert , through resentment against you , has put it in his power to make his own choice ; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a - year , to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do .
Elinor Dashwood	She will hardly be less hurt , I suppose , by Robert 's marrying Lucy , than she would have been by your marrying her .
Elinor Dashwood	He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . It was his business , however , to say that he DID , and he said it very prettily . What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives . That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive , to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas , was perfectly clear to Elinor ; and Edward himself , now thoroughly enlightened on her character , had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill - nature . Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions-- they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well - disposed , good - hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself .
Elinor Dashwood	"Edward was , of course , immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than Lucy 's conduct , nor more self - evident than the motive of it . Elinor scolded him , harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves , for having spent so much time with them at Norland , when he must have felt his own inconstancy . "" Your behaviour was certainly very wrong , "" said she ; "" because -- to say nothing of my own conviction , our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT , as you were THEN situated , could never be . """
Elinor Dashwood	I was simple enough to think , that because my FAITH was plighted to another , there could be no danger in my being with you ; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour .
Elinor Dashwood	I felt that I admired you , but I told myself it was only friendship ; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and Lucy , I did not know how far I was got .
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor smiled , and shook her head . Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon 's being expected at the Cottage , as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him , but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of Delaford--""Which , at present , "" said he , "" after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion , he must think I have never forgiven him for offering . "" NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place . But so little interest had be taken in the matter , that he owed all his knowledge of the house , garden , and glebe , extent of the parish , condition of the land , and rate of the tithes , to Elinor herself , who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon , and heard it with so much attention , as to be entirely mistress of the subject . One question after this only remained undecided , between them , one difficulty only was to be overcome ."
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor smiled , and shook her head . Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon 's being expected at the Cottage , as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him , but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of Delaford--""Which , at present , "" said he , "" after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion , he must think I have never forgiven him for offering .

One question after this only remained undecided , between them , one difficulty only was to be overcome ."
Elinor Dashwood	They were brought together by mutual affection , with the warmest approbation of their real friends ; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain -- and they only wanted something to live upon . Edward had two thousand pounds , and Elinor one , which , with Delaford living , was all that they could call their own ; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood should advance anything ; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a - year would supply them with the comforts of life .
Elinor Dashwood	But Elinor had no such dependence ; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars 's flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele , she feared that Robert 's offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny .
Elinor Dashwood	Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood , and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars , since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor . It would be needless to say , that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other , as they advanced in each other 's acquaintance , for it could not be otherwise . Their resemblance in good principles and good sense , in disposition and manner of thinking , would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship , without any other attraction ; but their being in love with two sisters , and two sisters fond of each other , made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate , which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment .
Elinor Dashwood	The letters from town , which a few days before would have made every nerve in Elinor 's body thrill with transport , now arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth .
Elinor Dashwood	Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars ; and even , if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son , his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter , nor be permitted to appear in her presence .
Elinor Dashwood	The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them , was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime , because , had any suspicion of it occurred to the others , proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage ; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy 's engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled , than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.--
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" You may certainly ask to be forgiven , "" said Elinor , "" because you have offended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother 's anger . """
Elinor Dashwood	In spite of his being allowed once more to live , however , he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure , till he had revealed his present engagement ; for the publication of that circumstance , he feared , might give a sudden turn to his constitution , and carry him off as rapidly as before . With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed , and he was listened to with unexpected calmness . Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood , by every argument in her power;--told him , that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;-- and enforced the assertion , by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE ; but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit -- and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor . What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward 's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage , without attempting a removal to Delaford ; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , when Marianne was taken from them , Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing , and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover .
Elinor Dashwood	In spite of his being allowed once more to live , however , he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure , till he had revealed his present engagement ; for the publication of that circumstance , he feared , might give a sudden turn to his constitution , and carry him off as rapidly as before .

Elinor Dashwood	It was as much , however , as was desired , and more than was expected , by Edward and Elinor ; and Mrs. Ferrars herself , by her shuffling excuses , seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more .
Elinor Dashwood	With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them , they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living , but the readiness of the house , to which Colonel Brandon , with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor , was making considerable improvements ; and after waiting some time for their completion , after experiencing , as usual , a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen , Elinor , as usual , broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready , and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Jennings 's prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas , and she found in Elinor and her husband , as she really believed , one of the happiest couples in the world .
Elinor Dashwood	and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence . Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars , as either Robert or Fanny ; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her , and Elinor , though superior to her in fortune and birth , was spoken of as an intruder , SHE was in every thing considered , and always openly acknowledged , to be a favourite child .
Elinor Dashwood	It was an arrangement , however , justified in its effects , if not in its cause ; for nothing ever appeared in Robert 's style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income , as either leaving his brother too little , or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular , from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home , and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits , he might be supposed no less contented with his lot , no less free from every wish of an exchange .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor 's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived , without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless , for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her .
Elinor Dashwood	Precious as was the company of her daughter to her , she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend ; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion - house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor . They each felt his sorrows , and their own obligations , and Marianne , by general consent , was to be the reward of all . With such a confederacy against her -- with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness -- with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself , which at last , though long after it was observable to everybody else -- burst on her -- what could she do ?
Elinor Dashwood	His wife was not always out of humour , nor his home always uncomfortable ; and in his breed of horses and dogs , and in sporting of every kind , he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity . For Marianne , however -- in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss -- he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her , and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;-- and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after - days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon .
Elinor Dashwood	Between Barton and Delaford , there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate;--and among the merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne , let it not be ranked as the least considerable , that though sisters , and living almost within sight of each other , they could live without disagreement between themselves , or producing coolness between their husbands .
Elinor Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor felt equal amazement .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor 's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother 's .
Elinor Dashwood	She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust .
Elinor Dashwood	Willoughby 's behaviour in taking leave of them , his embarrassment , and affectation of cheerfulness , and , above all , his unwillingness to accept her mother 's invitation , a backwardness so unlike a lover , so unlike himself , greatly disturbed her .
Elinor Dashwood	One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side ; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for , though when she considered what Marianne 's love for him was , a quarrel seemed almost impossible . But whatever might be the particulars of their separation , her sister 's affliction was indubitable ; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief , but feeding and encouraging as a duty . In about half an hour her mother returned , and though her eyes were red , her countenance was not uncheerful .
Elinor Dashwood	""" Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton , Elinor , "" said she , as she sat down to work , "" and with how heavy a heart does he travel ?"
Elinor Dashwood	"Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?""-- "" It was not inclination that he wanted , Elinor ; I could plainly see THAT ."
Elinor Dashwood	I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you .
Elinor Dashwood	I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--but you , Elinor , who love to doubt where you can -- it will not satisfy YOU , I know ; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it .
Elinor Dashwood	I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him , ) and on that account is eager to get him away;-- and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him . This is what I believe to have happened . He is , moreover , aware that she DOES disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from Devonshire for a while . You will tell me , I know , that this may or may NOT have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this .
Elinor Dashwood	"And now , Elinor , what have you to say ? "" "" Nothing , for you have anticipated my answer . "" "" Then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened ."
Elinor Dashwood	Oh , Elinor , how incomprehensible are your feelings !
Elinor Dashwood	You had rather take evil upon credit than good .
Elinor Dashwood	You had rather look out for misery for Marianne , and guilt for poor Willoughby , than an apology for the latter .
Elinor Dashwood	You are resolved to think him blameable , because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn . And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ? Are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ? Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love , and no reason in the world to think ill of ?
Elinor Dashwood	"And , after all , what is it you suspect him of ? "" "" I can hardly tell myself ."
Elinor Dashwood	There is great truth , however , in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him , and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body . Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct , and I will hope that he has .
Elinor Dashwood	"But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence?--I am happy -- and he is acquitted . """
Elinor Dashwood	my dear child , do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment ?
Elinor Dashwood	This is strange indeed , when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness .
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" I want no proof of their affection , "" said Elinor ; "" but of their engagement I do ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject , by either of them . "" "" I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly ."
Elinor Dashwood	My Elinor , is it possible to doubt their engagement ?
Elinor Dashwood	How could such a thought occur to you ?
Elinor Dashwood	How is it to be supposed that Willoughby , persuaded as he must be of your sister 's love , should leave her , and leave her perhaps for months , without telling her of his affection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence ?
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" I confess , "" replied Elinor , "" that every circumstance except ONE is in favour of their engagement ; but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject , and with me it almost outweighs every other . """
Elinor Dashwood	You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby , if , after all that has openly passed between them , you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together .
Elinor Dashwood	Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time ?
Elinor Dashwood	Do you suppose him really indifferent to her ?
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" No , I can not think that . He must and does love her I am sure ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" But with a strange kind of tenderness , if he can leave her with such indifference , such carelessness of the future , as you attribute to him . "" "" You must remember , my dear mother , that I have never considered this matter as certain ."
Elinor Dashwood	If you were to see them at the altar
Elinor Dashwood	, you would suppose they were going to be married .
Elinor Dashwood	Ungracious girl ! But I require no such proof .
Elinor Dashwood	You can not doubt your sister 's wishes .
Elinor Dashwood	It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect . But why ? Is he not a man of honour and feeling ?
Elinor Dashwood	""" "" I hope not , I believe not , "" cried Elinor ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I love Willoughby , sincerely love him ; and suspicion of his integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me . It has been involuntary , and I will not encourage it ."
Elinor Dashwood	I was startled , I confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality .
Elinor Dashwood	"But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed . He had just parted from my sister , had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction ; and if he felt obliged , from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith , to resist the temptation of returning here soon , and yet aware that by declining your invitation , by saying that he was going away for some time , he should seem to act an ungenerous , a suspicious part by our family , be might well be embarrassed and disturbed . In such a case , a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think , as well as more consistent with his general character;--but I will not raise objections against any one 's conduct on so illiberal a foundation , as a difference in judgment from myself , or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You speak very properly ."
Elinor Dashwood	They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret ; and Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations of her mother , to acknowledge the probability of many , and hope for the justice of all .
Elinor Dashwood	Her eyes were red and swollen ; and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty . She avoided the looks of them all , could neither eat nor speak , and after some time , on her mother 's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion , her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome , she burst into tears and left the room .
Elinor Dashwood	""" At any rate , "" said Elinor , wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister 's thoughts as clearly as she did , "" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Ay , my dear , I 'll warrant you we do ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" And now , "" silently conjectured Elinor , "" she will write to Combe by this day 's post ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" But if she DID , the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact . Whatever the truth of it might be , and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it , yet while she saw Marianne in spirits , she could not be very uncomfortable herself . And Marianne was in spirits ; happy in the mildness of the weather , and still happier in her expectation of a frost ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" Do n't you find it colder than it was in the morning , Elinor ?"
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor was alternately diverted and pained ; but Marianne persevered , and saw every night in the brightness of the fire , and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere , the certain symptoms
Elinor Dashwood	Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan , and excepting a few old city friends , whom , to Lady Middleton 's regret , she had never dropped , she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions . Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected , Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties , which , whether at home or abroad , formed only for cards , could have little to amuse her .
Elinor Dashwood	Colonel Brandon , who had a general invitation to the house , was with them almost every day ; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor , who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence , but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister . She feared it was a strengthening regard .
Elinor Dashwood	It grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne , and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton .
Elinor Dashwood	"Elinor , rejoiced to be assured of his being in London , now ventured to say , """
Elinor Dashwood	But Marianne seemed hardly to hear her , and on Mrs. Jenning 's entrance , escaped with the precious card .
Elinor Dashwood	This event , while it raised the spirits of Elinor , restored to those of her sister all , and more than all , their former agitation .
Elinor Dashwood	From this moment her mind was never quiet ; the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day , made her unfit for any thing .
Elinor Dashwood	She insisted on being left behind , the next morning , when the others went out .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor 's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street during their absence ; but a moment 's glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her , that Willoughby had paid no second visit there .
Elinor Dashwood	""" You are expecting a letter , then ? "" said Elinor , unable to be longer silent ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" You have no confidence in me , Marianne . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Nay , Elinor , this reproach from YOU -- you who have confidence in no one !"
Elinor Dashwood	""" Me ! "" returned Elinor in some confusion ; "" indeed , Marianne , I have nothing to tell ."
Elinor Dashwood	"We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing . """
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , distressed by this charge of reserve in herself , which she was not at liberty to do away , knew not how , under such circumstances , to press for greater openness in Marianne . Mrs. Jennings soon appeared , and the note being given her , she read it aloud .
Elinor Dashwood	The invitation was accepted ; but when the hour of appointment drew near , necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings , that they should both attend her on such a visit , Elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go , for still she had seen nothing of Willoughby ; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad , than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor found , when the evening was over , that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode , for although scarcely settled in town , Sir John had contrived to collect around him , nearly twenty young people , and to amuse them with a ball . This was an affair , however , of which Lady Middleton did not approve .
Elinor Dashwood	""" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . "" Marianne said no more , but looked exceedingly hurt . Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister 's relief , Elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother , and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne , to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed ; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow , that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby , for she could not suppose it to be to any other person . About the middle of the day , Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on business , and Elinor began her letter directly , while Marianne , too restless for employment , too anxious for conversation , walked from one window to the other , or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation ."
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother , relating all that had passed , her suspicions of Willoughby 's inconstancy , urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him . Her letter was scarcely finished , when a rap foretold a visitor , and Colonel Brandon was announced .
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor , persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned , impatiently expected its opening .
Elinor Dashwood	"It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction ; for , more than once before , beginning with the observation of "" your sister looks unwell to - day , "" or "" your sister seems out of spirits , "" he had appeared on the point , either of disclosing , or of inquiring , something particular about her . After a pause of several minutes , their silence was broken , by his asking her in a voice of some agitation , when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother ?"
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor was not prepared for such a question , and having no answer ready , was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient , of asking what he meant ?
Elinor Dashwood	"He tried to smile as he replied , "" your sister 's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" It can not be generally known , "" returned Elinor , "" for her own family do not know it . "" He looked surprised and said , "" I beg your pardon , I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" By many -- by some of whom you know nothing , by others with whom you are most intimate , Mrs. Jennings , Mrs. Palmer , and the Middletons ."
Elinor Dashwood	But still I might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister 's writing .
Elinor Dashwood	These words , which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister , affected her very much .
Elinor Dashwood	She was not immediately able to say anything , and even when her spirits were recovered , she debated for a short time , on the answer it would be most proper to give .
Elinor Dashwood	The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known to herself , that in endeavouring to explain it , she might be as liable to say too much as too little .
Elinor Dashwood	Yet as she was convinced that Marianne 's affection for Willoughby , could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon 's success , whatever the event of that affection might be , and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure , she thought it most prudent and kind , after some consideration , to say more than she really knew or believed . She acknowledged , therefore , that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other , of their mutual affection she had no doubt , and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear .
Elinor Dashwood	"He listened to her with silent attention , and on her ceasing to speak , rose directly from his seat , and after saying in a voice of emotion , "" to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her,""--took leave , and went away"
Elinor Dashwood	Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation , to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points ; she was left , on the contrary , with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon 's unhappiness , and was prevented even from wishing it removed , by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it .
Edward Ferrars	""" Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward , than he had been with respect to Marianne ; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two , as being somewhat newer and more conjectural ; and since Edward 's visit , they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks , as to excite general attention . The letter F-- had been likewise invariably brought forward , and found productive of such countless jokes , that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long established with Elinor ."
Edward Ferrars	The manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward , increased her curiosity ; for it struck her as being rather ill - natured , and suggested the suspicion of that lady 's knowing , or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing , for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars 's name by Miss Steele when alluded to , or even openly mentioned by Sir John .
Edward Ferrars	17 Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him ; for his coming to Barton was , in her opinion , of all things the most natural .
Edward Ferrars	He received the kindest welcome from her ; and shyness , coldness , reserve could not stand against such a reception .
Edward Ferrars	They had begun to fail him before he entered the house , and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood .
Edward Ferrars	Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters , without extending the passion to her ; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself .
Edward Ferrars	His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all , and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible .
Edward Ferrars	He was not in spirits , however ; he praised their house , admired its prospect , was attentive , and kind ; but still he was not in spirits .
Edward Ferrars	"The whole family perceived it , and Mrs. Dashwood , attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother , sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents . "" What are Mrs. Ferrars 's views for you at present , Edward ? "" said she , when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire ; "" are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself ? """
Edward Ferrars	"I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life ! """
Edward Ferrars	""" But how is your fame to be established ?"
Edward Ferrars	for famous you must be to satisfy all your family ; and with no inclination for expense , no affection for strangers , no profession , and no assurance , you may find it a difficult matter .
Edward Ferrars	""" I shall not attempt it . I have no wish to be distinguished ; and have every reason to hope I never shall ."
Edward Ferrars	I can not be forced into genius and eloquence .
Edward Ferrars	""" You have no ambition , I well know ."
Edward Ferrars	"Your wishes are all moderate . "" "" As moderate as those of the rest of the world , I believe ."
Edward Ferrars	I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy ; but , like every body else it must be in my own way .
Edward Ferrars	Greatness will not make me so .
Edward Ferrars	YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ?
Edward Ferrars	Elinor laughed .
Edward Ferrars	ONE is my wealth !
Edward Ferrars	I guessed how it would end .
Edward Ferrars	"A proper establishment of servants , a carriage , perhaps two , and hunters , can not be supported on less . "" Elinor smiled again , to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna . "" Hunters ! "" repeated Edward--""but why must you have hunters ? Every body does not hunt . "" Marianne coloured as she replied , "" But most people do ."
Edward Ferrars	""" What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London , "" said Edward , "" in such an event !"
Edward Ferrars	You , Miss Dashwood , would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you -- and as for Marianne , I know her greatness of soul , there would not be music enough in London to content her .
Edward Ferrars	And books!--Thomson , Cowper , Scott -- she would buy them all over and over again : she would buy up every copy , I believe , to prevent their falling into unworthy hands ; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree .
Edward Ferrars	Forgive me , if I am very saucy .
Edward Ferrars	"But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old disputes . "" "" I love to be reminded of the past , Edward -- whether it be melancholy or gay , I love to recall it -- and you will never offend me by talking of former times ."
Edward Ferrars	You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent -- some of it , at least -- my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books .
Edward Ferrars	""" And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs ."
Edward Ferrars	""" No , Edward , I should have something else to do with it . "" "" Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life -- your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ? "" "" Undoubtedly ."
Edward Ferrars	"It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them . "" "" Marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see , "" said Elinor , "" she is not at all altered ."
Edward Ferrars	""" She is only grown a little more grave than she was . "" "" Nay , Edward , "" said Marianne , "" you need not reproach me ."
Edward Ferrars	"You are not very gay yourself . "" "" Why should you think so ! "" replied he , with a sigh ."
Edward Ferrars	""" But gaiety never was a part of MY character . "" "" Nor do I think it a part of Marianne 's , "" said Elinor ; "" I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest , very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry . "" "" I believe you are right , "" he replied , "" and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl . """
Edward Ferrars	My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding .
Edward Ferrars	All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour .
Edward Ferrars	You must not confound my meaning .
Edward Ferrars	I am guilty , I confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ?
Edward Ferrars	""" "" You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility , "" said Edward to Elinor , "" Do you gain no ground ?"
Edward Ferrars	""" My judgment , "" he returned , "" is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister 's ."
Edward Ferrars	I never wish to offend , but I am so foolishly shy , that I often seem negligent , when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness .
Edward Ferrars	"I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company , I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility ! "" "" Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers , "" said Elinor ."
Edward Ferrars	""" She knows her own worth too well for false shame , "" replied Edward ."
Edward Ferrars	"If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful , I should not be shy . "" "" But you would still be reserved , "" said Marianne , "" and that is worse ."
Edward Ferrars	"Edward started--""Reserved !"
Edward Ferrars	"Am I reserved , Marianne ? """
Edward Ferrars	""" I do not understand you , "" replied he , colouring ."
Edward Ferrars	""" Reserved!--how , in what manner ? What am I to tell you ?"
Edward Ferrars	"Elinor looked surprised at his emotion ; but trying to laugh off the subject , she said to him , "" Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ? Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ? "" Edward made no answer ."
Edward Ferrars	His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him in their fullest extent -- and he sat for some time silent and dull .
Edward Ferrars	Edward remained a week at the cottage ; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer ; but , as if he were bent only on self - mortification , he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height .
Edward Ferrars	His spirits , during the last two or three days , though still very unequal , were greatly improved -- he grew more and more partial to the house and environs -- never spoke of going away without a sigh -- declared his time to be wholly disengaged -- even doubted to what place he should go when he left them -- but still , go he must .
Edward Ferrars	Never had any week passed so quickly -- he could hardly believe it to be gone .
Edward Ferrars	He said so repeatedly ; other things he said too , which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions .
Edward Ferrars	He had no pleasure at Norland ; he detested being in town ; but either to Norland or London , he must go .
Edward Ferrars	He valued their kindness beyond any thing , and his greatest happiness was in being with them . Yet , he must leave them at the end of a week , in spite of their wishes and his own , and without any restraint on his time . Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother 's account ; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her , as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son .
Edward Ferrars	"But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward 's affection , to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton , and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger . "" I think , Edward , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , as they were at breakfast the last morning , "" you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions ."
Edward Ferrars	Some inconvenience to your friends , indeed , might result from it -- you would not be able to give them so much of your time .
Edward Ferrars	But ( with a smile ) you would be materially benefited in one particular at least -- you would know where to go when you left them .
Edward Ferrars	""" "" I do assure you , "" he replied , "" that I have long thought on this point , as you think now ."
Edward Ferrars	It has been , and is , and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me , that I have had no necessary business to engage me , no profession to give me employment , or afford me any thing like independence .
Edward Ferrars	But unfortunately my own nicety , and the nicety of my friends , have made me what I am , an idle , helpless being .
Edward Ferrars	We never could agree in our choice of a profession . I always preferred the church , as I still do .
Edward Ferrars	But that was not smart enough for my family .
Edward Ferrars	That was a great deal too smart for me .
Edward Ferrars	But I had no inclination for the law , even in this less abstruse study of it , which my family approved .
Edward Ferrars	As for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it -- and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing .
Edward Ferrars	I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since .
Edward Ferrars	""" "" They will be brought up , "" said he , in a serious accent , "" to be as unlike myself as is possible . In feeling , in action , in condition , in every thing ."
Edward Ferrars	""" Come , come ; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits , Edward ."
Edward Ferrars	You are in a melancholy humour , and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy .
Edward Ferrars	Know your own happiness . You want nothing but patience -- or give it a more fascinating name , call it hope .
Edward Ferrars	Your mother will secure to you , in time , that independence you are so anxious for ; it is her duty , and it will , it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent .
Edward Ferrars	""" "" I think , "" replied Edward , "" that I may defy many months to produce any good to me . "" This desponding turn of mind , though it could not be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood , gave additional pain to them all in the parting , which shortly took place , and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor 's feelings especially , which required some trouble and time to subdue . But as it was her determination to subdue it , and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away , she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne , on a similar occasion , to augment and fix her sorrow , by seeking silence , solitude and idleness ."
Edward Ferrars	Elinor sat down to her drawing - table as soon as he was out of the house , busily employed herself the whole day , neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name , appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family , and if , by this conduct , she did not lessen her own grief , it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase , and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account .
Edward Ferrars	Without shutting herself up from her family , or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them , or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation , Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of Edward , and of Edward 's behaviour , in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce,--with tenderness , pity , approbation , censure , and doubt . There were moments in abundance , when , if not by the absence of her mother and sisters , at least by the nature of their employments , conversation was forbidden among them , and every effect of solitude was produced .
Edward Ferrars	, she was roused one morning , soon after Edward 's leaving them , by the arrival of company .
Edward Ferrars	"She came hallooing to the window , "" How do you do , my dear ?"
Edward Ferrars	How does Mrs. Dashwood do ? And where are your sisters ? What !
Edward Ferrars	you will be glad of a little company to sit with you .
Edward Ferrars	I have brought my other son and daughter to see you .
Edward Ferrars	Their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest , at once indisputable and alarming ; and Edward 's visit near Plymouth , his melancholy state of mind , his dissatisfaction at his own prospects , his uncertain behaviour towards herself , the intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections , which had often surprised her , the picture , the letter , the ring , formed altogether such a body of evidence , as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly , and established as a fact , which no partiality could set aside , his ill - treatment of herself.--Her
Edward Ferrars	resentment of such behaviour , her indignation at having been its dupe , for a short time made her feel only for herself ; but other ideas , other considerations , soon arose . Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her ? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel ?
Edward Ferrars	Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart ?
Edward Ferrars	His affection was all her own .
Edward Ferrars	Her mother , sisters , Fanny , all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland ; it was not an illusion of her own vanity .
Edward Ferrars	He certainly loved her .
Edward Ferrars	He had been blamable , highly blamable , in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be .
Edward Ferrars	In that , he could not be defended ; but if he had injured her , how much more had he injured himself ; if her case were pitiable , his was hopeless .
Edward Ferrars	His imprudence had made her miserable for a while ; but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise . She might in time regain tranquillity ; but HE , what had he to look forward to ?
Edward Ferrars	Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele ; could he , were his affection for herself out of the question , with his integrity , his delicacy , and well - informed mind , be satisfied with a wife like her -- illiterate , artful , and selfish ? The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature ; but the four succeeding years -- years , which if rationally spent , give such improvement to the understanding , must have opened his eyes to her defects of education , while the same period of time , spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits , had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty .
Edward Ferrars	If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself , his difficulties from his mother had seemed great , how much greater were they now likely to be , when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections , and probably inferior in fortune to herself . These difficulties , indeed , with a heart so alienated from Lucy , might not press very hard upon his patience ; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness , could be felt as a relief ! As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession , she wept for him , more than for herself .
Edward Ferrars	Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness , and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem , she thought she could even now , under the first smart of the heavy blow , command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters .
Edward Ferrars	The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne , what had been entrusted in confidence to herself , though it obliged her to unceasing exertion , was no aggravation of Elinor 's distress . On the contrary it was a relief to her , to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them , and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward , which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself , and which was more than she felt equal to support . From their counsel , or their conversation , she knew she could receive no assistance , their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress , while her self - command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise . She was stronger alone , and her own good sense so well supported her , that her firmness was as unshaken , her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable , as with regrets so poignant and so fresh , it was possible for them to be .
Edward Ferrars	She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again , she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward , whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him , and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy , by her readiness to enter on the matter again , and her calmness in conversing on it , that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend , which she very much feared her involuntary agitation , in their morning discourse , must have left at least doubtful . That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable : it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise , not merely from Lucy 's assertion , but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance , with a secret so confessedly and evidently important . And even Sir John 's joking intelligence must have had some weight . But indeed , while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward , it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous ; and
Edward Ferrars	What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be , but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy 's superior claims on Edward , and be taught to avoid him in future ?
Edward Ferrars	She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival 's intentions , and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed , to combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible ; she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was unwounded .
Edward Ferrars	It does not do him justice , to be sure , but yet I think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for.--I
Edward Ferrars	She put it into her hands as she spoke ; and when Elinor saw the painting , whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision , or her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind , she could have none of its being Edward 's face .
Edward Ferrars	""" I have never been able , "" continued Lucy , "" to give him my picture in return , which I am very much vexed at , for he has been always so anxious to get it !"
Edward Ferrars	Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward 's mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask .
Edward Ferrars	She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day , when Edward 's name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all .
Edward Ferrars	I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward 's sake these last four years .
Edward Ferrars	""" To be sure , "" continued Lucy , after a few minutes silence on both sides , "" his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor Edward is so cast down by it !"
Edward Ferrars	Did you not think him dreadful low - spirited when he was at Barton ?
Edward Ferrars	"He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple , to go to you , that I was afraid you would think him quite ill . "" "" Did he come from your uncle 's , then , when he visited us ?"
Edward Ferrars	""" Oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us . Did you think he came directly from town ?"
Edward Ferrars	""" No , "" replied Elinor , most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy 's veracity ; "" I remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth . "" She remembered too , her own surprise at the time , at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends , at his total silence with respect even to their names ."
Edward Ferrars	""" Did not you think him sadly out of spirits ? "" repeated Lucy ."
Edward Ferrars	We did , indeed , particularly so when he first arrived .
Edward Ferrars	""" I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter ; but it made him so melancholy , not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us , and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now ; for he writes in wretched spirits ."
Edward Ferrars	"I heard from him just before I left Exeter ; "" taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor ."
Edward Ferrars	""" You know his hand , I dare say , a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual.--He"
Edward Ferrars	was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full
Edward Ferrars	Elinor saw that it WAS his hand , and she could doubt no longer .
Edward Ferrars	This picture , she had allowed herself to believe , might have been accidentally obtained ; it might not have been Edward 's gift ; but a correspondence between them by letter , could subsist only under a positive engagement , could be authorised by nothing else ; for a few moments , she was almost overcome -- her heart sunk within her , and she could hardly stand ; but exertion was indispensably necessary ; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings , that her success was speedy , and for
Edward Ferrars	Yes , I have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even THAT .
Edward Ferrars	If he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture .
Edward Ferrars	Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him ?
Edward Ferrars	41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett 's Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life .
Edward Ferrars	So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood 's part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued .
Edward Ferrars	, was very urgent to prevent her sister 's going at all ; and Mrs. Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor 's service , so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward 's part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tete - a - tete with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike .
Edward Ferrars	"This living of Colonel Brandon's -- can it be true?--has he really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it . "" "" It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward . "" "" Really!--Well , this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no connection between them!--and now that livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this ? """
Edward Ferrars	Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation , is old enough to take it.--Aye , aye , that is the fact , depend upon it .
Edward Ferrars	""" Elinor contradicted it , however , very positively ; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward , and , therefore , must understand the terms on which it was given , obliged him to submit to her authority ."
Edward Ferrars	""" It is truly astonishing!""--he cried , after hearing what she said--""what could be the Colonel 's motive ? """
Edward Ferrars	""" Well , well ; whatever Colonel Brandon may be , Edward is a very lucky man.--You"
Edward Ferrars	Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing , that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure , an acquisition of wealth to her brother , by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished .
Edward Ferrars	""" Mrs. Ferrars , "" added he , lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject , "" knows nothing about it at present , and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.-- When the marriage takes place , I fear she must hear of it all . """
Edward Ferrars	When Edward 's unhappy match takes place , depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him ; and , therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event , must be concealed from her as much as possible .
Edward Ferrars	"Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son . "" "" You surprise me ; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time . """
Edward Ferrars	""" Choice!--how do you mean ? "" "" I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert . "" """
Edward Ferrars	After a few moments ' chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister 's being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother 's love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother 's integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart .
Edward Ferrars	They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves , before he began to speak of Edward ; for he , too , had heard of the living , and was very inquisitive on the subject .
Edward Ferrars	The idea of Edward 's being a clergyman , and living in a small parsonage - house , diverted him beyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice , and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown , he could conceive nothing more ridiculous . Elinor , while she waited in silence and immovable gravity , the conclusion of such folly , could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited . It was a look , however , very well bestowed , for it relieved her own feelings , and gave no intelligence to him . He was recalled from wit to wisdom , not by any reproof of her 's , but by his own sensibility .
Edward Ferrars	""" We may treat it as a joke , "" said he , at last , recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment--""but , upon my soul , it is a most serious business ."
Edward Ferrars	I am extremely sorry for it-- for I know him to be a very good - hearted creature ; as well - meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world .
Edward Ferrars	I could not believe it.-- My mother was the first person who told me of it ; and I , feeling myself called on to act with resolution , immediately said to her , ' My dear madam , I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion , but as for myself , I must say , that if Edward does marry this young woman , I never will see him again . '
Edward Ferrars	That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society!--but , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected .
Edward Ferrars	I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light .
Edward Ferrars	' My dear fellow , ' I should have said , ' consider what you are doing . You are making a most disgraceful connection , and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving . '
Edward Ferrars	He had just settled this point with great composure , when the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject .
Edward Ferrars	"For a short time he sat deep in thought , after Elinor had ceased to speak;--at last , and as if it were rather an effort , he said , "" Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability ."
Edward Ferrars	I have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother I know esteems him highly .
Edward Ferrars	""" Edward made no answer ; but when she had turned away her head , gave her a look so serious , so earnest , so uncheerful , as seemed to say , that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion - house much greater . "" Colonel Brandon , I think , lodges in St. James Street , "" said he , soon afterwards , rising from his chair ."
Edward Ferrars	""" I must hurry away then , to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU ; to assure him that he has made me a very -- an exceedingly happy man ."
Edward Ferrars	Elinor did not offer to detain him ; and they parted , with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him ; on HIS , with rather an attempt to return the same good will , than the power of expressing it .
Edward Ferrars	And with this pleasing anticipation , she sat down to reconsider the past , recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward ; and , of course , to reflect on her own with discontent .
Edward Ferrars	"Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty -- You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ? """
Edward Ferrars	""" A very simple one -- to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . """
Edward Ferrars	""" My dear ma'am , "" said Elinor , "" what can you be thinking of?-- Why , Colonel Brandon 's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . """
Edward Ferrars	""" Lord bless you , my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars ! """
Edward Ferrars	am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars , I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him . Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already .
Edward Ferrars	"She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily towards her , on hearing this , and , in a voice of surprise and concern , which required no explanation to her , repeated , "" Devonshire !"
Edward Ferrars	"A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them . "" She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton ; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection ."
Edward Ferrars	To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match .
Edward Ferrars	""" "" I shall very soon think him handsome , Elinor , if I do not now ."
Edward Ferrars	"When you tell me to love him as a brother , I shall no more see imperfection in his face , than I now do in his heart . "" Elinor started at this declaration , and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into , in speaking of him ."
Edward Ferrars	She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion .
Edward Ferrars	""" I do not attempt to deny , "" said she , "" that I think very highly of him -- that I greatly esteem , that I like him ."
Edward Ferrars	"Marianne here burst forth with indignation-- "" Esteem him !"
Edward Ferrars	Like him !
Edward Ferrars	Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion -- the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly .
Edward Ferrars	I am by no means assured of his regard for me .
Edward Ferrars	There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is .
Edward Ferrars	In my heart I feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference .
Edward Ferrars	But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination .
Edward Ferrars	He is very far from being independent .
Edward Ferrars	What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank .
Edward Ferrars	""" And you really are not engaged to him ! "" said she ."
Edward Ferrars	I shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . Oh !
Edward Ferrars	"if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself , how delightful it would be ! """
Edward Ferrars	She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it .
Edward Ferrars	There was , at times , a want of spirits about him which , if it did not denote indifference , spoke of something almost as unpromising .
Edward Ferrars	A doubt of her regard , supposing him to feel it , need not give him more than inquietude .
Edward Ferrars	It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him .
Edward Ferrars	A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection . She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present , nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself , without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement .
Edward Ferrars	She was far from depending on that result of his preference of her , which her mother and sister still considered as certain . Nay , the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard ; and sometimes , for a few painful minutes , she believed it to be no more than friendship .
Edward Ferrars	But , whatever might really be its limits , it was enough , when perceived by his sister , to make her uneasy , and at the same time , ( which was still more common , ) to make her uncivil .
Edward Ferrars	Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing .
Edward Ferrars	Elinor 's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable.-- She had seen enough of her pride , her meanness , and her determined prejudice against herself , to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement , and retarded the marriage , of Edward and herself , had he been otherwise free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake , that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars 's creation , preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice , or any solicitude for her good opinion .
Edward Ferrars	Or at least , if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward 's being fettered to Lucy , she determined , that had Lucy been more amiable , she OUGHT to have rejoiced .
Edward Ferrars	"But it seemed to satisfy Lucy , for she directly replied , "" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward 's love , it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton 's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;-- and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me.--"
Edward Ferrars	"For where she DOES dislike , I know it is most violent . "" Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph , by the door 's being thrown open , the servant 's announcing Mr. Ferrars , and Edward 's immediately walking in . It was a very awkward moment ; and the countenance of each shewed that it was so . They all looked exceedingly foolish ; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again , as to advance farther into it ."
Edward Ferrars	She could therefore only LOOK her tenderness , and after slightly addressing him , said no more .
Edward Ferrars	But Elinor had more to do ; and so anxious was she , for his sake and her own , to do it well , that she forced herself , after a moment 's recollection , to welcome him , with a look and manner that were almost easy , and almost open ; and another struggle , another effort still improved them .
Edward Ferrars	She would not allow the presence of Lucy , nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself , to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him , and that she had very much regretted being from home , when he called before in Berkeley Street . She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which , as a friend and almost a relation , were his due , by the observant eyes of Lucy , though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her .
Edward Ferrars	Her manners gave some re - assurance to Edward , and he had courage enough to sit down ; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion , which the case rendered reasonable , though his sex might make it rare ; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy 's , nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor 's
Edward Ferrars	Lucy , with a demure and settled air , seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others , and would not say a word ; and almost every thing that WAS said , proceeded from Elinor , who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother 's health , their coming to town , & c. which Edward ought to have inquired about , but never did .
Edward Ferrars	When that was once done , however , it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease ; for Marianne 's joy hurried her into the drawing - room immediately .
Edward Ferrars	Her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings , strong in itself , and strongly spoken . She
Edward Ferrars	met him with a hand that would be taken , and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister .
Edward Ferrars	""" Dear Edward ! "" she cried , "" this is a moment of great happiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing ? """
Edward Ferrars	Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved , but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt .
Edward Ferrars	Again they all sat down , and for a moment or two all were silent ; while Marianne was looking with the most speaking tenderness , sometimes at Edward and sometimes at Elinor , regretting only that their delight in each other should be checked by Lucy 's unwelcome presence .
Edward Ferrars	"Edward was the first to speak , and it was to notice Marianne 's altered looks , and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her . "" Oh , do n't think of me ! "" she replied with spirited earnestness , though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke , "" do n't think of MY health ."
Edward Ferrars	"That must be enough for us both . "" This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy , nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy , who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression ."
Edward Ferrars	""" Do you like London ? "" said Edward , willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject ."
Edward Ferrars	The sight of you , Edward , is the only comfort it has afforded ; and thank Heaven !
Edward Ferrars	"you are what you always were ! """
Edward Ferrars	"I think , Elinor , "" she presently added , "" we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton ."
Edward Ferrars	In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge .
Edward Ferrars	Poor Edward muttered something , but what it was , nobody knew , not even himself .
Edward Ferrars	But Marianne , who saw his agitation , and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself , was perfectly satisfied ,
Edward Ferrars	""" We spent such a day , Edward , in Harley Street yesterday !"
Edward Ferrars	"So dull , so wretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head , which can not be said now . "" And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever , and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother , till they were more in private ."
Edward Ferrars	""" But why were you not there , Edward?--Why did you not come ?"
Edward Ferrars	""" I was engaged elsewhere . "" "" Engaged !"
Edward Ferrars	"Elinor was very angry , but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting ; for she calmly replied , "" Not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street ."
Edward Ferrars	And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure . He is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body I ever saw . Edward , it is so , and I will say it .
Edward Ferrars	are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you
Edward Ferrars	must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation .
Edward Ferrars	The nature of her commendation , in the present case , however , happened to be particularly ill - suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors , and was so very unexhilarating to Edward , that he very soon got up to go away .
Edward Ferrars	""" Going so soon ! "" said Marianne ; "" my dear Edward , this must not be ."
Edward Ferrars	And drawing him a little aside , she whispered her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer .
Edward Ferrars	But even this encouragement failed , for he would go ; and Lucy , who would have outstaid him , had his visit lasted two hours , soon afterwards went away .
Edward Ferrars	""" Could not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teazing to Edward ! """
Edward Ferrars	""" Why so?--we were all his friends , and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any ."
Edward Ferrars	"It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves . """
Edward Ferrars	All that she could hope , was that Edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne 's mistaken warmth , nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting -- and this she had every reason to expect .
Edward Ferrars	But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr. Palmer 's , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child .
Edward Ferrars	and nurse said just the same . But Charlotte , she would not be satisfied , so Mr. Donavan was sent for ; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street , so he stepped over directly , and as soon as ever he saw the child , be said just as we did , that it was nothing in the world but the red gum , and then Charlotte was easy .
Edward Ferrars	So upon that , he smirked , and simpered , and looked grave , and seemed to know something or other , and at last he said in a whisper , ' For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister 's indisposition , I think it advisable to say , that I believe there is no great reason for alarm ; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will do very well . '
Edward Ferrars	' Lord ! ' says I , ' is Mrs. Dashwood ill ? '
Edward Ferrars	Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ) , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There 's for you , my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it
Edward Ferrars	out directly . Well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;-- till this very morning , poor Nancy , who , you know , is a well - meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out .
Edward Ferrars	' Lord ! ' thinks she to herself , ' they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ; ' and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet - work , little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord 's daughter or other , I forget who . So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride .
Edward Ferrars	She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother 's ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing - room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . So up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for Lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on .
Edward Ferrars	Poor soul !
Edward Ferrars	I pity HER .
Edward Ferrars	Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes .
Edward Ferrars	The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad .
Edward Ferrars	He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care .
Edward Ferrars	There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a - year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . Lord !
Edward Ferrars	"how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . "" Here Mrs. Jennings ceased , and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce . Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that Mrs. Jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of Marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it ."
Edward Ferrars	She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was ; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last , than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy .
Edward Ferrars	What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do , though there could not be a doubt of its nature , she was anxious to hear ; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself .
Edward Ferrars	No time was to be lost in undeceiving her , in making her acquainted with the real truth , and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others , without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister , or any resentment against Edward . Elinor 's office was a painful one.--She
Edward Ferrars	going to remove what she really believed to be her sister 's chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and to make Marianne , by a resemblance in their situations , which to HER fancy would seem strong , feel all her own disappointment over again . But unwelcome as such a task must be , it was necessary to be done , and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it .
Edward Ferrars	She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings , or to represent herself as suffering much , any otherwise than as the self - command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward 's engagement , might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne . Her narration was clear and simple ; and though it could not be given without emotion , it was not accompanied by violent agitation , nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer , for Marianne listened with horror , and cried excessively .
Edward Ferrars	Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses , no less than in theirs ; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind , and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence , was readily offered . But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither . Edward seemed a second Willoughby ; and acknowledging as Elinor did , that she HAD loved him most sincerely , could she feel less than herself !
Edward Ferrars	As for Lucy Steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her . She would not even admit it to have been natural ; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so , by that which only could convince her , a better knowledge of mankind . Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed.--Marianne 's feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment .
Edward Ferrars	"The first question on her side , which led to farther particulars , was , "" How long has this been known to you , Elinor ? has he written to you ?"
Edward Ferrars	""" I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother , "" added Elinor ; "" and once or twice I have attempted it;-- but without betraying my trust , I never could have convinced you . "" "" Four months!--and yet you loved him!""-- "" Yes ."
Edward Ferrars	But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others was dear to me , I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt . Now , I can think and speak of it with little emotion .
Edward Ferrars	I acquit Edward of essential misconduct .
Edward Ferrars	I wish him very happy ; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty , that though now he may harbour some regret , in the end he must become so .
Edward Ferrars	"Lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--And after all , Marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one 's happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant -- it is not fit -- it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edward will marry Lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER.""-- "" If such is your way of thinking , "" said Marianne , "" if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else , your resolution , your self - command , are , perhaps , a little less to be wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension ."
Edward Ferrars	""" I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For four months , Marianne , I have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as I thought , with triumph.-- This person 's suspicions , therefore , I have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling -- surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW ."
Edward Ferrars	In such a frame of mind as she was now in , Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality.-- These were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make . She performed her promise of being discreet , to admiration.--She
Edward Ferrars	"""--She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another , and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward 's affection , it cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such"
Edward Ferrars	Mrs. Ferrars too -- in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress -- but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome .
Edward Ferrars	Poor Fanny ! she was in hysterics all yesterday .
Edward Ferrars	But I would not alarm you too much . Donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended ; her constitution is a good one , and her resolution equal to any thing .
Edward Ferrars	She has borne it all , with the fortitude of an angel !
Edward Ferrars	She says she never shall think well of anybody again ; and one can not wonder at it , after being so deceived!-- meeting with such ingratitude , where so much kindness had been shewn , so much confidence had been placed !
Edward Ferrars	And now to be so rewarded !
Edward Ferrars	What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered , when first Fanny broke it to her , is not to be described .
Edward Ferrars	While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him , was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such a suspicion could never have entered her head !
Edward Ferrars	If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere , it could not be in THAT quarter .
Edward Ferrars	' THERE , to be sure , ' said she , ' I might have thought myself safe . '
Edward Ferrars	She was quite in an agony .
Edward Ferrars	We consulted together , however , as to what should be done , and at last she determined to send for Edward .
Edward Ferrars	But I am sorry to relate what ensued .
Edward Ferrars	All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement , assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments , and Fanny 's entreaties , was of no avail .
Edward Ferrars	I never thought Edward so stubborn , so unfeeling before .
Edward Ferrars	"His mother explained to him her liberal designs , in case of his marrying Miss Morton ; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate , which , clear of land - tax , brings in a good thousand a - year ; offered even , when matters grew desperate , to make it twelve hundred ; and in opposition to this , if he still persisted in this low connection , represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match . His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all ; she would never see him again ; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance , that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support , she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it . "" Here Marianne , in an ecstasy of indignation , clapped her hands together , and cried , "" Gracious God !"
Edward Ferrars	""" Well may you wonder , Marianne , "" replied her brother , "" at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these ."
Edward Ferrars	Edward said very little ; but what he did say , was in the most determined manner .
Edward Ferrars	Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement .
Edward Ferrars	"He would stand to it , cost him what it might . "" "" Then , "" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity , no longer able to be silent , "" he has acted like an honest man !"
Edward Ferrars	I beg your pardon , Mr. Dashwood , but if he had done otherwise , I should have thought him a rascal .
Edward Ferrars	"I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . """
Edward Ferrars	John Dashwood was greatly astonished ; but his nature was calm , not open to provocation , and he never wished to offend anybody , especially anybody of good fortune .
Edward Ferrars	"He therefore replied , without any resentment , "" I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours , madam ."
Edward Ferrars	Miss Lucy Steele is , I dare say , a very deserving young woman , but in the present case you know , the connection must be impossible .
Edward Ferrars	And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle 's care , the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars , is perhaps , altogether a little extraordinary .
Edward Ferrars	In short , I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for , Mrs. Jennings .
Edward Ferrars	"We all wish her extremely happy ; and Mrs. Ferrars 's conduct throughout the whole , has been such as every conscientious , good mother , in like circumstances , would adopt . It has been dignified and liberal . Edward has drawn his own lot , and I fear it will be a bad one . """
Edward Ferrars	Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension ; and Elinor 's heart wrung for the feelings of Edward , while braving his mother 's threats , for a woman who could not reward him .
Edward Ferrars	""" Well , sir , "" said Mrs. Jennings , "" and how did it end ? "" """
Edward Ferrars	I am sorry to say , ma'am , in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother 's notice . He left her house yesterday , but where he is gone , or whether he is still in town , I do not know ; for WE of course can make no inquiry .
Edward Ferrars	""" Poor young man!--and what is to become of him ? "" "" What , indeed , ma'am !"
Edward Ferrars	We must all feel for him ; and the more so , because it is totally out of our power to assist him .
Edward Ferrars	""" "" Poor young man ! "" cried Mrs. Jennings , "" I am sure"
Edward Ferrars	he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him .
Edward Ferrars	"It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns . "" Elinor 's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward , though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it ."
Edward Ferrars	""" If he would only have done as well by himself , "" said John Dashwood , "" as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing . But as it is , it must be out of anybody 's power to assist him . And there is one thing more preparing against him , which must be worse than all -- his mother has determined , with a very natural kind of spirit , to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately , which might have been Edward 's , on proper conditions ."
Edward Ferrars	"Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man , "" continued John , "" than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own ?"
Edward Ferrars	"I feel for him sincerely . "" A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion , concluded his visit ; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really believed there was no material danger in Fanny 's indisposition , and that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it"
Edward Ferrars	, he went away ; leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion , as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars 's conduct , the Dashwoods ' , and Edward 's . Marianne 's indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room ; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor , and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings , they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party .
Edward Ferrars	This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood , a gentleman - like and pleasing young man , who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister 's establishment at Norland , and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there .
Edward Ferrars	Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest , for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich ; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence , for , except a trifling sum , the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother .
Edward Ferrars	It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable , that he loved her daughter , and that Elinor returned the partiality . It was contrary to every doctrine of her 's that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition ; and that Elinor 's merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her , was to her comprehension impossible .
Edward Ferrars	Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address .
Edward Ferrars	He was not handsome , and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing .
Edward Ferrars	He was too diffident to do justice to himself ; but when his natural shyness was overcome , his behaviour gave every indication of an open , affectionate heart .
Edward Ferrars	His understanding was good , and his education had given it solid improvement . But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister , who longed to see him distinguished -- as -- they hardly knew what . They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other . His mother wished to interest him in political concerns , to get him into parliament , or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day . Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise ; but in the mean while , till one of these superior blessings could be attained , it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche .
Edward Ferrars	But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches .
Edward Ferrars	All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life . Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising .
Edward Ferrars	Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood 's attention ; for she was , at that time , in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects .
Edward Ferrars	She saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive , and she liked him for it .
Edward Ferrars	He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill - timed conversation .
Edward Ferrars	She was first called to observe and approve him farther , by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister . It was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother .
Edward Ferrars	""" It is enough , "" said she ; "" to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough ."
Edward Ferrars	"I love him already . "" "" I think you will like him , "" said Elinor , "" when you know more of him . "" "" Like him ! "" replied her mother with a smile ."
Edward Ferrars	""" I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love . "" "" You may esteem him ."
Edward Ferrars	""" I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love . "" Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him . Her manners were attaching , and soon banished his reserve . She speedily comprehended all his merits ; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration ; but she really felt assured of his worth : and even that"
Edward Ferrars	quietness of manner , which militated against all her established ideas of what a young man 's address ought to be , was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate .
Edward Ferrars	No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to Elinor , than she considered their serious attachment as certain , and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching .
Edward Ferrars	I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward 's heart .
Edward Ferrars	Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly .
Edward Ferrars	But yet -- he is not the kind of young man -- there is something wanting -- his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister .
Edward Ferrars	His eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence .
Edward Ferrars	And besides all this , I am afraid , Mamma , he has no real taste .
Edward Ferrars	Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor 's drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth .
Edward Ferrars	It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter .
Edward Ferrars	He admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur .
Edward Ferrars	He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both .
Edward Ferrars	mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward 's manner in reading to us last night !
Edward Ferrars	"To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference!""-- "" He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose . I thought so at the time ; but you WOULD give him Cowper ."
Edward Ferrars	""" Nay , Mamma , if he is not to be animated by Cowper!-- but we must allow for difference of taste . Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him ."
Edward Ferrars	But it would have broke MY heart , had I loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility . Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love .
Edward Ferrars	"He must have all Edward 's virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm . "" "" Remember , my love , that you are not seventeen ."
Edward Ferrars	Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest , that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland .
Edward Ferrars	"Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods;""--was Mrs. Jennings 's address to him when he first called on her , after their leaving her was settled--""for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back!--Lord !"
Edward Ferrars	""" Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it;-- and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor 's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might NOT hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne 's turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel 's inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house ."
Edward Ferrars	She wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette . What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest .
Edward Ferrars	"They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable , when another lucky stop in Marianne 's performance brought her these words in the Colonel 's calm voice,-- "" I am afraid it can not take place very soon . """
Edward Ferrars	"Astonished and shocked at so unlover - like a speech , she was almost ready to cry out , "" Lord ! what should hinder it?""--but checking her desire , confined herself to this silent ejaculation . "" This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older . """
Edward Ferrars	"This delay on the Colonel 's side , however , did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least , for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards , and moving different ways , Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say , and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said , "" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you . """
Edward Ferrars	"Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude , and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence , the Colonel should be able to take leave of them , as he immediately did , with the utmost sang - froid , and go away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor . What had really passed between them was to this effect . "" I have heard , "" said he , with great compassion , "" of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?-- "" Elinor told him that it was ."
Edward Ferrars	Such as it is , however , my pleasure in presenting him to it , will be very great .
Edward Ferrars	"Pray assure him of it . """
Edward Ferrars	Elinor 's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater , had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand .
Edward Ferrars	The preferment , which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward , was already provided to enable him to marry;-- and SHE , of all people in the world , was fixed on to bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure , less pleasing , might have a share in that emotion , her esteem for the general benevolence , and her gratitude for the particular friendship , which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act , were strongly felt , and warmly expressed .
Edward Ferrars	She thanked him for it with all her heart , spoke of Edward 's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve ; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure , if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another . But at the same time , she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself .
Edward Ferrars	It was an office in short , from which , unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER , she would have been very glad to be spared herself;-- but Colonel Brandon , on motives of equal delicacy , declining it likewise , still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means , that she would not on any account make farther opposition .
Edward Ferrars	Edward , she believed , was still in town , and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele . She could undertake therefore to inform him of it , in the course of the day .
Edward Ferrars	After this had been settled , Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour , and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret , that the house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor , as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do , made very light of , at least as far as regarded its size .
Edward Ferrars	""" The smallness of the house , "" said she , "" I can not imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income . "" By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr. Ferrars 's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation ; for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such an income , as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on-- and he said so ."
Edward Ferrars	I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive .
Edward Ferrars	If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present .
Edward Ferrars	What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness .
Edward Ferrars	"His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least , I am afraid it can not take place very soon.-- "" Such was the sentence which , when misunderstood , so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings ; but after this narration of what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor , while they stood at the window , the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting , may perhaps appear in general , not less reasonably excited , nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage ."
Edward Ferrars	""" Edward talks of going to Oxford soon , "" said she ; "" but now he is lodging at No . -- , Pall Mall ."
Edward Ferrars	What an ill - natured woman his mother is , an't she ?
Edward Ferrars	Edward have got some business at Oxford , he says ; so he must go there for a time ; and after THAT , as soon as he can light upon a Bishop , he will be ordained .
Edward Ferrars	I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious !
Edward Ferrars	They will tell me I should write to the Doctor , to get Edward the curacy of his new living .
Edward Ferrars	Edward 's marriage with Lucy was as firmly determined on , and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain ,
Edward Ferrars	as she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended , exactly after her expectation , on his getting that preferment , of which , at present , there seemed not the smallest chance .
Edward Ferrars	"The continuance of their engagement , and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end , was all her communication ; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark . "" Wait for his having a living!--ay , we all know how THAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth , and finding no good comes of it , will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a - year , with the interest of his two thousand pounds , and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her.--Then they will have a child every year !"
Edward Ferrars	We have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember , as will Edward too , who I have told of it .
Edward Ferrars	I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother 's anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and
Edward Ferrars	should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs. Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr. Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us.--Poor
Edward Ferrars	"As soon as Elinor had finished it , she performed what she concluded to be its writer 's real design , by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings , who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise . "" Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye , that was quite proper to let him be off if he would ."
Edward Ferrars	That was just like Lucy.--Poor soul !
Edward Ferrars	I wish I COULD get him a living , with all my heart.--She calls me dear Mrs. Jennings , you see .
Edward Ferrars	"Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude , and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence , the Colonel should be able to take leave of them , as he immediately did , with the utmost sang - froid , and go away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor . What had really passed between them was to this effect . "" I have heard , "" said he , with great compassion , "" of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?-- "" Elinor told him that it was ."
Edward Ferrars	I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street , and am much pleased with him . He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , I wish it still more .
Edward Ferrars	I understand that he intends to take orders .
Edward Ferrars	Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford , now just vacant , as I am informed by this day 's post , is his , if he think it worth his acceptance -- but THAT , perhaps , so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now , it may be nonsense to appear to doubt ; I only wish it were more valuable.--
Edward Ferrars	""" The smallness of the house , "" said she , "" I can not imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income . "" By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr. Ferrars 's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation ; for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such an income , as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on-- and he said so ."
Edward Ferrars	""" This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it can not enable him to marry ."
Edward Ferrars	If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present .
Edward Ferrars	What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness .
Edward Ferrars	They will tell me I should write to the Doctor , to get Edward the curacy of his new living .
Edward Ferrars	I write to the Doctor , indeed ! '
Edward Ferrars	Margaret returned , and the family were again all restored to each other , again quietly settled at the cottage ; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to Barton , at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future . Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward .
Edward Ferrars	She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London , nothing new of his plans , nothing certain even of his present abode . Some letters had passed between her and her brother , in consequence of Marianne 's illness ; and in the first of John 's , there had been this sentence:--
Edward Ferrars	""" We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward , and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject , but conclude him to be still at Oxford ; "" which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence , for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters ."
Edward Ferrars	She was not doomed , however , to be long in ignorance of his measures .
Edward Ferrars	She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message , and was very confident that Edward would never come near them .
Edward Ferrars	"And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . "" "" Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , "" said Elinor , "" you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . "" Marianne 's countenance sunk . "" And what , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , "" is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ?"
Edward Ferrars	"I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . "" Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours . To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy 's account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished . "" I will have you BOTH go , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ; "" these objections are nonsensical ."
Edward Ferrars	"You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law 's family . "" Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother 's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself , that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed , and now on this attack , though almost hopeless of success , she forced herself to begin her design by saying , as calmly as she could , "" I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . """
Edward Ferrars	"You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes . "" "" Indeed you wrong me , "" replied Lucy , with great solemnity ; "" I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ' I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , ' I should resolve upon doing it immediately . """
Edward Ferrars	To be sure , your brother and sister will ask you to come to them .
Edward Ferrars	"You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law 's family . "" Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother 's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself , that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed , and now on this attack , though almost hopeless of success , she forced herself to begin her design by saying , as calmly as she could , "" I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . """
Edward Ferrars	"Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward 's future wife , and replied , "" This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one ."
Edward Ferrars	"But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward . He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it . """
Edward Ferrars	Elinor was soon called to the card - table by the conclusion of the first rubber , and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end , to which both of them submitted without any reluctance , for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before ; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife ; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage , which sincere affection on HER side would have given , for self - interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement , of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary . From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor , and when entered on by Lucy , who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it , and was particularly careful to inform her confidante , of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward , it was treated by the former with calmness and caution , and dismissed as soon as civility would allow ; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which Lucy did not deserve , and which were dangerous to herself .
Edward Ferrars	49 Unaccountable , however , as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family , it was certain that Edward was free ; and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre - determined by all;--for
Edward Ferrars	after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement , contracted without his mother 's consent , as he had already done for more than four years , nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of THAT , than the immediate contraction of another .
Edward Ferrars	His errand at Barton , in fact , was a simple one .
Edward Ferrars	It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;--and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question , it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did , so much in need of encouragement and fresh air .
Edward Ferrars	How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution , however , how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred , in what manner he expressed himself , and how he was received , need not be particularly told .
Edward Ferrars	This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table at four o'clock , about three hours after his arrival , he had secured his lady , engaged her mother 's consent , and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover , but , in the reality of reason and truth , one of the happiest of men .
Edward Ferrars	His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful . He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart , and raise his spirits .
Edward Ferrars	He was released without any reproach to himself , from an entanglement which had long formed his misery , from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;-- and elevated at once to that security with another , which he must have thought of almost with despair , as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire .
Edward Ferrars	He was brought , not from doubt or suspense , but from misery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine , flowing , grateful cheerfulness , as his friends had never witnessed in him before . His heart was now open to Elinor , all its weaknesses , all its errors confessed , and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty - four .
Edward Ferrars	""" It was a foolish , idle inclination on my side , "" said he , "" the consequence of ignorance of the world-- and want of employment ."
Edward Ferrars	Had my brother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr. Pratt , I think --
Edward Ferrars	nay , I am sure , it would never have happened ; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought , at the time , a most unconquerable preference for his niece , yet had I then had any pursuit , any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months , I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment , especially by mixing more with the world , as in such case I must have done
Edward Ferrars	But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen . I had therefore nothing in the world to do , but to fancy myself in love ; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable , as I had no friend , no companion in my brother , and disliked new acquaintance , it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple , where I always felt myself at home , and was always sure of a welcome ; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen : Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging . She was pretty too -- at least I thought so THEN ; and I had seen so little of other women , that I could make no comparisons , and see no defects .
Edward Ferrars	"Considering everything , therefore , I hope , foolish as our engagement was , foolish as it has since in every way been proved , it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly . "" The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the Dashwoods , was such -- so great -- as promised them all , the satisfaction of a sleepless night ."
Edward Ferrars	Mrs. Dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love Edward , nor praise Elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both .
Edward Ferrars	Comparisons would occur -- regrets would arise;--and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language . But Elinor -- how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil .
Edward Ferrars	But when the second moment had passed , when she found every doubt , every solicitude removed , compared her situation with what so lately it had been,--saw him honourably released from his former engagement , saw him instantly profiting by the release , to address herself and declare an affection as tender , as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,--she was oppressed , she was overcome by her own felicity;-- and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better , it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits , or any degree of tranquillity to her heart . Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him , it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor 's company , or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past , the present , and the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures , yet with lovers it is different .
Edward Ferrars	How they could be thrown together , and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,--a girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family -- it was beyond her comprehension to make out .
Edward Ferrars	Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing , that , perhaps , at first accidentally meeting , the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other , as to lead by degrees to all the rest .
Edward Ferrars	Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street , of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother 's affairs might have done , if applied to in time .
Edward Ferrars	She repeated it to Edward .
Edward Ferrars	""" THAT was exactly like Robert,""--was his immediate observation.--""And THAT , "" he presently added , "" might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began . And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour ."
Edward Ferrars	""" How long it had been carrying on between them , however , he was equally at a loss with herself to make out ; for at Oxford , where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting London , he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself , and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent , nor less affectionate than usual ."
Edward Ferrars	Not the smallest suspicion , therefore , had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself , he had been for some time , he believed , half stupified between the wonder , the horror , and the joy of such a deliverance .
Edward Ferrars	He put the letter into Elinor 's hands .
Edward Ferrars	I have burnt all your letters , and will return your picture the first opportunity .
Edward Ferrars	Please to destroy my scrawls -- but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep .
Edward Ferrars	""" I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition , "" said Edward.--""For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU in former days.--In a sister it is bad enough , but in a wife!--how I have blushed over"
Edward Ferrars	I believe I may say that since the first half year of our foolish -- business -- this is the only letter I ever received from her , of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style .
Edward Ferrars	The independence she settled on Robert , through resentment against you , has put it in his power to make his own choice ; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a - year , to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do .
Edward Ferrars	She will hardly be less hurt , I suppose , by Robert 's marrying Lucy , than she would have been by your marrying her .
Edward Ferrars	""" "" She will be more hurt by it , for Robert always was her favourite.--She will be more hurt by it , and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner ."
Edward Ferrars	""" In what state the affair stood at present between them , Edward knew not , for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him . He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy 's letter arrived , and with only one object before him , the nearest road to Barton , had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct , with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection ."
Edward Ferrars	He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . It was his business , however , to say that he DID , and he said it very prettily . What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives . That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive , to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas , was perfectly clear to Elinor ; and Edward himself , now thoroughly enlightened on her character , had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill - nature . Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions-- they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well - disposed , good - hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself .
Edward Ferrars	Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement , which , long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother 's anger , had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him .
Edward Ferrars	""" I thought it my duty , "" said he , "" independent of my feelings , to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not , when I was renounced by my mother , and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me . In such a situation as that , where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature , how could I suppose , when she so earnestly , so warmly insisted on sharing my fate , whatever it might be , that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement ? And even now , I can not comprehend on what motive she acted , or what fancied advantage it could be to her , to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard , and who had only two thousand pounds in the world ."
Edward Ferrars	She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living .
Edward Ferrars	""" No ; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour ; that your own family might in time relent . And at any rate , she lost nothing by continuing the engagement , for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions . The connection was certainly a respectable one , and probably gained her consideration among her friends ; and , if nothing more advantageous occurred , it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single . """
Edward Ferrars	"Edward was , of course , immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than Lucy 's conduct , nor more self - evident than the motive of it . Elinor scolded him , harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves , for having spent so much time with them at Norland , when he must have felt his own inconstancy . "" Your behaviour was certainly very wrong , "" said she ; "" because -- to say nothing of my own conviction , our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT , as you were THEN situated , could never be . """
Edward Ferrars	"He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart , and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement . """
Edward Ferrars	I was simple enough to think , that because my FAITH was plighted to another , there could be no danger in my being with you ; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour .
Edward Ferrars	I felt that I admired you , but I told myself it was only friendship ; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and Lucy , I did not know how far I was got .
Edward Ferrars	After that , I suppose , I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex , and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it , were no better than
Edward Ferrars	"these:--The danger is my own ; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself . """
Edward Ferrars	"Elinor smiled , and shook her head . Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon 's being expected at the Cottage , as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him , but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of Delaford--""Which , at present , "" said he , "" after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion , he must think I have never forgiven him for offering . "" NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place . But so little interest had be taken in the matter , that he owed all his knowledge of the house , garden , and glebe , extent of the parish , condition of the land , and rate of the tithes , to Elinor herself , who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon , and heard it with so much attention , as to be entirely mistress of the subject . One question after this only remained undecided , between them , one difficulty only was to be overcome ."
Edward Ferrars	They were brought together by mutual affection , with the warmest approbation of their real friends ; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain -- and they only wanted something to live upon . Edward had two thousand pounds , and Elinor one , which , with Delaford living , was all that they could call their own ; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood should advance anything ; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a - year would supply them with the comforts of life .
Edward Ferrars	Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him ; and on THAT he rested for the residue of their income .
Edward Ferrars	But Elinor had no such dependence ; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars 's flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele , she feared that Robert 's offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny .
Edward Ferrars	About four days after Edward 's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared , to complete Mrs. Dashwood 's satisfaction , and to give her the dignity of having , for the first time since her living at Barton , more company with her than her house would hold .
Edward Ferrars	Edward was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer , and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the Park ; from whence he usually returned in the morning , early enough to interrupt the lovers ' first tete - a - tete before breakfast .
Edward Ferrars	A three weeks ' residence at Delaford , where , in his evening hours at least , he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty - six and seventeen , brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne 's looks , all the kindness of her welcome , and all the encouragement of her mother 's language , to make it cheerful .
Edward Ferrars	Among such friends , however , and such flattery , he did revive .
Edward Ferrars	No rumour of Lucy 's marriage had yet reached him:--he knew nothing of what had passed ; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering .
Edward Ferrars	Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood , and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars , since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor . It would be needless to say , that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other , as they advanced in each other 's acquaintance , for it could not be otherwise . Their resemblance in good principles and good sense , in disposition and manner of thinking , would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship , without any other attraction ; but their being in love with two sisters , and two sisters fond of each other , made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate , which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment .
Edward Ferrars	Poor Mr. Edward !
Edward Ferrars	I can not get him out of my head , but you must send for him to Barton , and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him
Edward Ferrars	.
Edward Ferrars	Robert 's offence was unpardonable , but Lucy 's was infinitely worse .
Edward Ferrars	Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars ; and even , if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son , his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter , nor be permitted to appear in her presence .
Edward Ferrars	The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them , was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime , because , had any suspicion of it occurred to the others , proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage ; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy 's engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled , than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.--
Edward Ferrars	"He thus continued : "" Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward 's name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a line has been received from him on the occasion ."
Edward Ferrars	Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars 's heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children .
Edward Ferrars	""" This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of Edward ."
Edward Ferrars	It determined him to attempt a reconciliation , though not exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister .
Edward Ferrars	""" A letter of proper submission ! "" repeated he ; "" would they have me beg my mother 's pardon for Robert 's ingratitude to HER , and breach of honour to ME?--I can make no submission -- I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy ; but that would not interest.--I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make ."
Edward Ferrars	""" "" You may certainly ask to be forgiven , "" said Elinor , "" because you have offended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother 's anger . """
Edward Ferrars	"He agreed that he might . "" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first . "" He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour.-- "" And if they really DO interest themselves , "" said Marianne , in her new character of candour , "" in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit . "" After a visit on Colonel Brandon 's side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to Delaford , that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on his journey to town ."
Edward Ferrars	After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars , just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring , the reproach of being too amiable , Edward was admitted to her presence , and pronounced to be again her son .
Edward Ferrars	For many years of her life she had had two sons ; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago , had robbed her of one ; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any ; and now , by the resuscitation of Edward , she had one again .
Edward Ferrars	In spite of his being allowed once more to live , however , he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure , till he had revealed his present engagement ; for the publication of that circumstance , he feared , might give a sudden turn to his constitution , and carry him off as rapidly as before . With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed , and he was listened to with unexpected calmness . Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood , by every argument in her power;--told him , that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;-- and enforced the assertion , by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE ; but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit -- and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor . What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward 's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny .
Edward Ferrars	It was as much , however , as was desired , and more than was expected , by Edward and Elinor ; and Mrs. Ferrars herself , by her shuffling excuses , seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more .
Edward Ferrars	With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them , they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living , but the readiness of the house , to which Colonel Brandon , with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor , was making considerable improvements ; and after waiting some time for their completion , after experiencing , as usual , a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen , Elinor , as usual , broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready , and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn .
Edward Ferrars	Mrs. Jennings 's prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas , and she found in Elinor and her husband , as she really believed , one of the happiest couples in the world .
Edward Ferrars	Instead of talking of Edward , they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other , and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own ; and in short , it became speedily evident to both , that he had entirely supplanted his brother .
Edward Ferrars	He was proud of his conquest , proud of tricking Edward , and very proud of marrying privately without his mother 's consent . What immediately followed is known .
Edward Ferrars	They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish ; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut -- and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;-- and from thence returning to town , procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars , by the simple expedient of asking it , which , at Lucy 's instigation , was adopted .
Edward Ferrars	and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence . Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars , as either Robert or Fanny ; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her , and Elinor , though superior to her in fortune and birth , was spoken of as an intruder , SHE was in every thing considered , and always openly acknowledged , to be a favourite child .
Edward Ferrars	What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son , might have puzzled many people to find out ; and what Robert had done to succeed to it , might have puzzled them still more .
Edward Ferrars	It was an arrangement , however , justified in its effects , if not in its cause ; for nothing ever appeared in Robert 's style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income , as either leaving his brother too little , or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular , from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home , and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits , he might be supposed no less contented with his lot , no less free from every wish of an exchange .
Edward Ferrars	Precious as was the company of her daughter to her , she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend ; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion - house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor . They each felt his sorrows , and their own obligations , and Marianne , by general consent , was to be the reward of all . With such a confederacy against her -- with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness -- with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself , which at last , though long after it was observable to everybody else -- burst on her -- what could she do ?
Margaret Dashwood	The high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits , were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties ; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one memorable morning direct their steps , attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky , and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned .
Margaret Dashwood	""" Is there a felicity in the world , "" said Marianne , "" superior to this?--Margaret , we will walk here at least two hours . """
Margaret Dashwood	Margaret agreed , and they pursued their way against the wind , resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer , when suddenly the clouds united over their heads , and a driving rain set full in their face.-- Chagrined and surprised , they were obliged , though unwillingly , to turn back , for no shelter was nearer than their own house .
Margaret Dashwood	Marianne had at first the advantage , but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground ; and Margaret , unable to stop herself to assist her , was involuntarily hurried along , and reached the bottom in safety . A gentleman carrying a gun , with two pointers playing round him , was passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne , when her accident happened .
Margaret Dashwood	The gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . Then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by Margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither Margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour . Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression .
Margaret Dashwood	""" I wish , "" said Margaret , striking out a novel thought , "" that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece ! """
Margaret Dashwood	""" Oh dear ! "" cried Margaret , "" how happy I should be ! I wonder what I should do with it ! """
Margaret Dashwood	Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point .
Margaret Dashwood	"I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again""-- Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John ."
Margaret Dashwood	The shock of Colonel Brandon 's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne , that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection .
Margaret Dashwood	Margaret , the other sister , was a good - humored , well - disposed girl ; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne 's romance , without having much of her sense , she did not , at thirteen , bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life .
Margaret Dashwood	Margaret returned , and the family were again all restored to each other , again quietly settled at the cottage ; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to Barton , at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future . Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward .
Margaret Dashwood	and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the maid , returned to Elinor , who , though still much disordered , had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas , as to the source of his intelligence . Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself ; and Elinor
Margaret Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood 's and Elinor 's appetites were equally lost , and Margaret might think herself very well off , that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced , so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals , she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before .
John Willoughby	Marianne had at first the advantage , but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground ; and Margaret , unable to stop herself to assist her , was involuntarily hurried along , and reached the bottom in safety . A gentleman carrying a gun , with two pointers playing round him , was passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne , when her accident happened .
John Willoughby	He put down his gun and ran to her assistance . She had raised herself from the ground , but her foot had been twisted in her fall , and she was scarcely able to stand .
John Willoughby	The gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . Then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by Margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither Margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour . Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression .
John Willoughby	Had he been even old , ugly , and vulgar , the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child ; but the influence of youth , beauty , and elegance ,
John Willoughby	She thanked him again and again ; and , with a sweetness of address which always attended her , invited him to be seated .
John Willoughby	But this he declined , as he was dirty and wet .
John Willoughby	His name , he replied , was Willoughby , and his present home was at Allenham , from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood .
John Willoughby	The honour was readily granted , and he then departed , to make himself still more interesting , in the midst of a heavy rain . His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration , and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.-- Marianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest , for the confusion which crimsoned over her face , on his lifting her up , had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house . But she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise . His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story ; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality , there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her .
John Willoughby	Every circumstance belonging to him was interesting .
John Willoughby	His name was good , his residence was in their favourite village , and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting - jacket was the most becoming .
John Willoughby	"Her imagination was busy , her reflections were pleasant , and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded . Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors ; and Marianne 's accident being related to him , he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham . "" Willoughby ! "" cried Sir John ; "" what , is HE in the country ?"
John Willoughby	"That is good news however ; I will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on Thursday . "" "" You know him then , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ."
John Willoughby	""" Know him ! to be sure I do . Why , he is down here every year ."
John Willoughby	""" And what sort of a young man is he ?"
John Willoughby	""" And is that all you can say for him ? "" cried Marianne , indignantly ."
John Willoughby	""" But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance ?"
John Willoughby	What his pursuits , his talents , and genius ?
John Willoughby	""" Upon my soul , "" said he , "" I do not know much about him as to all THAT . But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw ."
John Willoughby	Was she out with him today ?
John Willoughby	""" But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr. Willoughby 's pointer , than he could describe to her the shades of his mind ."
John Willoughby	""" But who is he ?"
John Willoughby	""" Where does he come from ?"
John Willoughby	"Has he a house at Allenham ? """
John Willoughby	"On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence ; and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the country ; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court , to whom he was related , and whose possessions he was to inherit ; adding , "" Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself ."
John Willoughby	"Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . "" "" I do not believe , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , with a good humoured smile , "" that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him . It is not an employment to which they have been brought up . Men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich ."
John Willoughby	I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible .
John Willoughby	""" "" He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived , "" repeated Sir John ."
John Willoughby	""" I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o'clock till four , without once sitting down ."
John Willoughby	""" "" Did he indeed ? "" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes , "" and with elegance , with spirit ? """
John Willoughby	""" Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . "" "" That is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be ."
John Willoughby	You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon .
John Willoughby	""" "" Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire ? "" said Elinor ."
John Willoughby	yes , extremely well ; that is , I do not believe many people are acquainted with him , because Combe Magna is so far off ; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you .
John Willoughby	Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes , and so you may tell your sister .
John Willoughby	She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her .
John Willoughby	""" Mrs. Palmer 's information respecting Willoughby was not very material ; but any testimony in his favour , however small , was pleasing to her ."
John Willoughby	He valued their kindness beyond any thing , and his greatest happiness was in being with them . Yet , he must leave them at the end of a week , in spite of their wishes and his own , and without any restraint on his time . Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother 's account ; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her , as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son .
John Willoughby	Disappointed , however , and vexed as she was , and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself , she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications , which had been rather more painfully extorted from her , for Willoughby 's service , by her mother . His want of spirits , of openness , and of consistency , were most usually attributed to his want of independence , and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars 's disposition and designs . The shortness of his visit , the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them , originated in the same fettered inclination , the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother . The old well - established grievance of duty against will , parent against child , was the cause of all .
John Willoughby	When Marianne was recovered , the schemes of amusement at home and abroad , which Sir John had been previously forming , were put into execution .
John Willoughby	In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included ; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods , to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne , of marking his animated admiration of her , and of receiving , in her behaviour to himself , the most pointed assurance of her affection .
John Willoughby	Willoughby thought the same ; and their behaviour at all times , was an illustration of their opinions .
John Willoughby	When he was present she had no eyes for any one else .
John Willoughby	Every thing he did , was right .
John Willoughby	Every thing he said , was clever .
John Willoughby	If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards , he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand .
John Willoughby	Her heart was devoted to Willoughby , and the fond attachment to Norland , which she brought with her from Sussex , was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before , by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home .
John Willoughby	Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them ; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired .
John Willoughby	Her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home;-- and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys . In Colonel Brandon alone , of all her new acquaintance , did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities , excite the interest of friendship , or give pleasure as a companion . Willoughby was out of the question .
John Willoughby	Her admiration and regard , even her sisterly regard , was all his own ; but he was a lover ; his attentions were wholly Marianne 's , and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing .
John Willoughby	"Colonel Brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne , and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister . Elinor 's compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him . This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park , when they were sitting down together by mutual consent , while the others were dancing . His eyes were fixed on Marianne , and , after a silence of some minutes , he said , with a faint smile , "" Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments . """
John Willoughby	""" Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist . "" "" I believe she does ."
John Willoughby	But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , I know not .
John Willoughby	"A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . "" "" This will probably be the case , "" he replied ; "" and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions ."
John Willoughby	""" I can not agree with you there , "" said Elinor ."
John Willoughby	Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage .
John Willoughby	"After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,-- "" Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ?"
John Willoughby	""" This , "" said he , "" can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments -- No , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous !"
John Willoughby	I speak from experience .
John Willoughby	"I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an inforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances""-- Here he stopt suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered Elinor 's head . The lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips ."
John Willoughby	As it was , it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard .
John Willoughby	your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust .
John Willoughby	""" "" In defence of your protege you can even be saucy . "" "" My protege , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me ."
John Willoughby	He has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind .
John Willoughby	"I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature . "" "" That is to say , "" cried Marianne contemptuously , "" he has told you , that in the East Indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome . "" "" He WOULD have told me so , I doubt not , had I made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed . "" "" Perhaps , "" said Willoughby , "" his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins . "" "" I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour ."
John Willoughby	But why should you dislike him ?
John Willoughby	""" "" I do not dislike him . I consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body 's good word , and nobody 's notice ; who , has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year . """
John Willoughby	""" Add to which , "" cried Marianne , "" that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . That his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression ."
John Willoughby	""" "" You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , "" replied Elinor , "" and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid ."
John Willoughby	pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , I believe , possessing an amiable heart .
John Willoughby	""" Miss Dashwood , "" cried Willoughby , "" you are now using me unkindly . You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will ."
John Willoughby	You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful .
John Willoughby	I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon ; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and I can not persuade him to buy my brown mare . If it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable
John Willoughby	, I am ready to confess it .
John Willoughby	"And in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you can not deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever . """
John Willoughby	The ivory , the gold , and the pearls , all received their appointment , and the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick - case , drew on his gloves with leisurely care , and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods , but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration , walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference . Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward , was on the point of concluding it , when another gentleman presented himself at her side . She turned her eyes towards his face , and found him with some surprise to be her brother .
John Willoughby	John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again ; it rather gave them satisfaction ; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive .
John Willoughby	Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother ; and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him , by the arrival of Mrs. Jennings 's servant , who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door .
John Willoughby	Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs , was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage , and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day , took leave .
John Willoughby	"His visit was duly paid . He came with a pretence at an apology from their sister - in - law , for not coming too ; "" but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where . """
John Willoughby	Mrs. Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her . His manners to THEM , though calm , were perfectly kind ; to Mrs. Jennings , most attentively civil ; and on Colonel Brandon 's coming in soon after himself , he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say , that he only wanted to know him to be rich , to be equally civil to HIM . After staying with them half an hour , he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street , and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton .
John Willoughby	As soon as they were out of the house , his enquiries began .
John Willoughby	"And her mother too , Mrs. Ferrars , a very good - natured woman , I am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day . "" Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer . "" It would be something remarkable , now , "" he continued , "" something droll , if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time . And yet it is not very unlikely . "" "" Is Mr. Edward Ferrars , "" said Elinor , with resolution , "" going to be married ? "" """
John Willoughby	He has a most excellent mother .
John Willoughby	Mrs. Ferrars , with the utmost liberality , will come forward , and settle on him a thousand a year , if the match takes place . The lady is the Hon . Miss Morton , only daughter of the late Lord Morton , with thirty thousand pounds .
John Willoughby	"It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park , and the flower - garden will slope down just before it , and be exceedingly pretty . We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow . "" Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself ; and was very thankful that Marianne was not present , to share the provocation . Having now said enough to make his poverty clear , and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear - rings for each of his sisters , in his next visit at Gray 's his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn , and he began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings . """
John Willoughby	"I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . "" Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon ; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished , and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman , and promoting the marriage by every possible attention . He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself , to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal ; and an offer from Colonel Brandon , or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings , was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect ."
John Willoughby	Sir John was ready to like anybody , and though Mr. Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses , he soon set him down as a very good - natured fellow : while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think
John Willoughby	his acquaintance worth having ; and Mr. Dashwood went away delighted with both .
John Willoughby	""" I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny , "" said he , as he walked back with his sister ."
John Willoughby	Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know .
John Willoughby	"But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both . """
John Willoughby	All that remained to be done was to be speedy ; and , therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings 's maid with her sister , she hurried down stairs . The bustle in the vestibule , as she passed along an inner lobby , assured her that they were already in the house . She rushed to the drawing - room,--she entered it,--and saw only Willoughby .
John Willoughby	Elinor , for some time after he left her , for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away , remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas , widely differing in themselves , but of which sadness was the general result , to think even of her sister .
John Willoughby	Willoughby , he , whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men
John Willoughby	Willoughby , in spite of all his faults , excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them , which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family , with a tenderness , a regret , rather in proportion ,
John Willoughby	as she soon acknowledged within herself -- to his wishes than to his merits .
John Willoughby	She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for Marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge .
John Willoughby	When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne , she found her just awaking , refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes .
John Willoughby	The past , the present , the future , Willoughby 's visit , Marianne 's safety , and her mother 's expected arrival , threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue , and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister . Short was the time , however , in which that fear could affect her , for within half an hour after Willoughby 's leaving the house , she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment 's horrible suspense , she ran immediately into the hall , and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it .
John Willoughby	"Willoughby , "" poor Willoughby , "" as she now allowed herself to call him , was constantly in her thoughts ; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world , and now blamed , now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before ."
John Willoughby	But her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful .
John Willoughby	She dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower . Then , remembering Colonel Brandon , reproved herself , felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival 's , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby 's death .
John Willoughby	But Mrs. Dashwood , trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her , was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it . Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her;-- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor .
John Willoughby	""" His regard for her , infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned , as much more warm ,"
John Willoughby	Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything;--Marianne 's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.-- His own merits must soon secure it .
John Willoughby	His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed;--and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy .
John Willoughby	My partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby -- but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.-- There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby 's eyes at times , which I did not like .
John Willoughby	"Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother , without waiting for her assent , continued , "" And his manners , the Colonel 's manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby 's ever were , but they"
John Willoughby	"Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness -- often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other . I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be with Colonel Brandon . "" She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree with her , but her dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence ."
John Willoughby	Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person , and Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private , to wish success to her friend , and yet in wishing it , to feel a pang for Willoughby .
John Willoughby	By one measure I might have saved myself .
John Willoughby	In the height of her morality , good woman ! she offered to forgive the past , if I would marry Eliza . That could not be -- and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house .
John Willoughby	The night following this affair -- I was to go the next morning-- was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be .
John Willoughby	My affection for Marianne , my thorough conviction of her attachment to me -- it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty , or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches , which I was naturally inclined to feel , and expensive society had increased . I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife , if I chose to address her , and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do . A heavy scene however awaited me , before I could leave Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day ; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement .
John Willoughby	But whether I should write this apology , or deliver it in person , was a point of long debate .
John Willoughby	To see Marianne , I felt , would be dreadful , and I even doubted whether I could see her again , and keep to my resolution .
John Willoughby	In that point , however , I undervalued my own magnanimity , as the event declared ; for I went , I saw her , and saw her miserable , and left her miserable -- and left her hoping never to see her again .
John Willoughby	""" "" Why did you call , Mr. Willoughby ? "" said Elinor , reproachfully ; "" a note would have answered every purpose.-- Why was it necessary to call ? "" "" It was necessary to my own pride ."
John Willoughby	I could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you , or the rest of the neighbourhood , to suspect any part of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself-- and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage , in my way to Honiton .
John Willoughby	The sight of your dear sister , however , was really dreadful ; and , to heighten the matter , I found her alone .
John Willoughby	You were all gone I do not know where .
John Willoughby	I had left her only the evening before , so fully , so firmly resolved within my self on doing right !
John Willoughby	"A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever ; and I remember how happy , how gay were my spirits , as I walked from the cottage to Allenham , satisfied with myself , delighted with every body ! But in this , our last interview of friendship , I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling . Her sorrow , her disappointment , her deep regret , when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately -- I never shall forget it -- united too with such reliance , such confidence in me!--Oh , God!--what a hard - hearted rascal I was ! "" They were both silent for a few moments . Elinor first spoke ."
John Willoughby	""" Did you tell her that you should soon return ?"
John Willoughby	""""
John Willoughby	""" I do not know what I told her , "" he replied , impatiently ; "" less than was due to the past , beyond a doubt , and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future"
John Willoughby	I can not think of it.--It wo n't do.--Then
John Willoughby	came your dear mother to torture me farther , with all her kindness and confidence .
John Willoughby	I was miserable .
John Willoughby	Miss Dashwood , you can not have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery .
John Willoughby	I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid , rascally folly of my own heart , that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now .
John Willoughby	Well , I went , left all that I loved , and went to those to whom , at best , I was only indifferent .
John Willoughby	"My journey to town -- travelling with my own horses , and therefore so tediously -- no creature to speak to -- my own reflections so cheerful -- when I looked forward every thing so inviting!--when I looked back at Barton , the picture so soothing!--oh , it was a blessed journey ! """
John Willoughby	""" Well , sir , "" said Elinor , who , though pitying him , grew impatient for his departure , "" and this is all ?"
John Willoughby	""" When the first of hers reached me ( as it immediately did , for I was in town the whole time , ) what I felt is-- in the common phrase , not to be expressed ; in a more simple one -- perhaps too simple to raise any emotion-- my feelings were very , very painful.--Every line , every word was -- in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer , were she here , would forbid -- a dagger to my heart ."
John Willoughby	"To know that Marianne was in town was -- in the same language-- a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste , her opinions -- I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure they are dearer . "" Elinor 's heart , which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation , was now softened again;--yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last . """
John Willoughby	"Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear . """
John Willoughby	""" Marianne 's note , by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse ."
John Willoughby	I say awakened , because time and London , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and I had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become
John Willoughby	talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , ' I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married .
John Willoughby	I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that I was using her infamously . But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me .
John Willoughby	To retreat was impossible .
John Willoughby	All that I had to do , was to avoid you both .
John Willoughby	I sent no answer to Marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street;--but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , I watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name .
John Willoughby	""" "" Watched us out of the house ! "" "" Even so ."
John Willoughby	You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you , how often I was on the point of falling in with you .
John Willoughby	I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight , as the carriage drove by .
John Willoughby	Lodging as I did in Bond Street , there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you ; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side , a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight , could have separated us so long .
John Willoughby	I avoided the Middletons as much as possible , as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common . Not aware of their being in town , however , I blundered on Sir John , I believe , the first day of his coming , and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings 's .
John Willoughby	He asked me to a party , a dance at his house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there , I should have felt it too certain a thing , to trust myself near him .
John Willoughby	The next morning brought another short note from Marianne-- still affectionate , open , artless , confiding -- everything that could make MY conduct most hateful .
John Willoughby	answer it .
John Willoughby	I tried -- but could not frame a sentence .
John Willoughby	But I thought of her , I believe , every moment of the day .
John Willoughby	If you CAN pity me , Miss Dashwood , pity my situation as it was THEN .
John Willoughby	With my head and heart full of your sister , I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those three or four weeks were worse than all . Well , at last , as I need not tell you , you were forced on me ; and what a sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!-- Marianne , beautiful as an angel on one side , calling me Willoughby in such a tone!--Oh , God!--holding out her hand to me , asking me for an explanation , with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and Sophia , jealous as the devil on the other hand , looking all that was -- Well , it does not signify ; it is over now.-- Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could ; but not before I had seen Marianne 's sweet face as white as death.--THAT was the last , last look I ever had of her;-- the last manner in which she appeared to me .
John Willoughby	It was a horrid sight!--yet when I thought of her to - day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world .
John Willoughby	"She was before me , constantly before me , as I travelled , in the same look and hue . "" A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded ."
John Willoughby	"Willoughby first rousing himself , broke it thus : "" Well , let me make haste and be gone ."
John Willoughby	""" We are assured of it . "" "" Your poor mother , too!--doting on Marianne . "" "" But the letter , Mr. Willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to say about that ?"
John Willoughby	Your sister wrote to me again , you know , the very next morning . You saw what she said .
John Willoughby	I was breakfasting at the Ellisons,--and her letter , with some others , was brought to me there from my lodgings .
John Willoughby	It happened to catch Sophia 's eye before it caught mine -- and its size , the elegance of the paper , the hand - writing altogether , immediately gave her a suspicion .
John Willoughby	Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire , and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was , and made her more jealous than ever .
John Willoughby	Her wretchedness I could have borne , but her passion -- her malice -- At all events it must be appeased .
John Willoughby	"And , in short -- what do you think of my wife 's style of letter - writing?--delicate -- tender-- truly feminine -- was it not ? "" "" Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand - writing . "" "" Yes , but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to ."
John Willoughby	The original was all her own -- her own happy thoughts and gentle diction . But what could I do!--we were engaged , every thing in preparation , the day almost fixed -- But I am talking like a fool .
John Willoughby	Preparation!--day!--In honest words , her money was necessary to me , and in a situation like mine , any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture .
John Willoughby	And after all , what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends , in what language my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end .
John Willoughby	My business was to declare myself a scoundrel , and whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.-- ' I am ruined for ever in their opinion-- ' said I to myself--'I am shut out for ever from their society , they already think me an unprincipled fellow , this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one . '
John Willoughby	Such were my reasonings , as , in a sort of desperate carelessness , I copied my wife 's words , and parted with the last relics of Marianne .
John Willoughby	Her three notes -- unluckily they were all in my pocketbook , or I should have denied their existence , and hoarded them for ever -- I was forced to put them up , and could not even kiss them .
John Willoughby	And the lock of hair -- that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket - book , which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear lock -- all , every memento was torn from me .
John Willoughby	""" "" You are very wrong , Mr. Willoughby , very blamable , "" said Elinor , while her voice , in spite of herself , betrayed her compassionate emotion ; "" you ought not to speak in this way , either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister ."
John Willoughby	You had made your own choice .
John Willoughby	It was not forced on you .
John Willoughby	Your wife has a claim to your politeness , to your respect , at least . She must be attached to you , or she would not have married you .
John Willoughby	To treat her with unkindness , to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne -- nor can I
John Willoughby	suppose it a relief to your own conscience .
John Willoughby	""" "" Do not talk to me of my wife , "" said he with a heavy sigh.-- "" She does not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no regard for her when we married.--Well , married we were , and came down to Combe Magna to be happy , and afterwards returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity me , Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?--"
John Willoughby	Am I -- be it only one degree -- am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before?--My intentions were not always wrong .
John Willoughby	"Have I explained away any part of my guilt ? "" "" Yes , you have certainly removed something -- a little.-- You have proved yourself , on the whole , less faulty than I had believed you . You have proved your heart less wicked , much less wicked ."
John Willoughby	But I hardly know -- the misery that you have inflicted -- I hardly know what could have made it worse .
John Willoughby	""" "" Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered , what I have been telling you?--Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours ."
John Willoughby	You tell me that she has forgiven me already .
John Willoughby	Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart , and of my present feelings , will draw from her a more spontaneous , more natural , more gentle , less dignified , forgiveness .
John Willoughby	Tell her of my misery and my penitence -- tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her , and if you will , that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever .
John Willoughby	""" "" I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification ."
John Willoughby	"But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard of her illness . "" "" Last night , in Drury Lane lobby , I ran against Sir John Middleton , and when he saw who I was -- for the first time these two months -- he spoke to me.--That he had cut me ever since my marriage , I had seen without surprise or resentment . Now , however , his good - natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to -- though probably he did not think it WOULD -- vex me horridly . As bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland -- a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent -- the Palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c.--I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John . His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill - will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy ."
John Willoughby	What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying -- and dying too , believing me the greatest villain upon earth , scorning , hating me in her latest moments -- for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed ?
John Willoughby	"ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing-- What I felt was dreadful!--My resolution was soon made , and at eight o'clock this morning I was in my carriage . Now you know all . "" Elinor made no answer ."
John Willoughby	"The attachment , from which against honour , against feeling , against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself , now , when no longer allowable , governed every thought ; and the connection , for the sake of which he had , with little scruple , left her sister to misery , was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature . From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby , who , rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful , started up in preparation for going , and said-- "" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off . "" "" Are you going back to town ?"
John Willoughby	I have business there ; from thence to town in a day or two .
John Willoughby	He held out his hand .
John Willoughby	She could not refuse to give him hers's;--he pressed it with affection .
John Willoughby	""" And you DO think something better of me than you did?""--said he , letting it fall , and leaning against the mantel - piece as if forgetting he was to go ."
John Willoughby	Elinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave , pitied , wished him well -- was even interested in his happiness -- and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it .
John Willoughby	His answer was not very encouraging .
John Willoughby	""" As to that , "" said he , "" I must rub through the world as well as I can ."
John Willoughby	Domestic happiness is out of the question .
John Willoughby	If , however , I am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions , it may be the means -- it may put me on my guard -- at least , it may be something to live for .
John Willoughby	"Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again-- "" Elinor stopped him with a reproof ."
John Willoughby	""" Well,""--he replied--""once more good bye ."
John Willoughby	I shall now go away and live in dread of one event .
John Willoughby	""" "" What do you mean ? "" "" Your sister 's marriage . "" "" You are very wrong ."
John Willoughby	""" "" What do you mean ? "" "" Your sister 's marriage . "" "" You are very wrong ."
John Willoughby	And if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , I could least bear -- but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive .
John Willoughby	And if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , I could least bear -- but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive .
John Willoughby	"Good bye,--God bless you ! """
John Willoughby	And with these words , he almost ran out of the room .
John Willoughby	The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said , lasted no longer than while she spoke , and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction . It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter , and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her , at intervals , to withhold her pen , were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby .
John Willoughby	"Elinor , who saw as plainly by this , as if she had seen the direction , that it must come from Willoughby , felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head , and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jenning 's notice . That good lady , however , saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking . Of Elinor 's distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as Marianne disappeared , she said , "" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature ."
John Willoughby	"Elinor , though never less disposed to speak than at that moment , obliged herself to answer such an attack as this , and , therefore , trying to smile , replied , "" And have you really , Ma'am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister 's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby ?"
John Willoughby	Mrs. Jennings laughed again , but Elinor had not spirits to say more , and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written , hurried away to their room , where , on opening the door , she saw Marianne stretched on the bed , almost choked by grief , one letter in her hand , and two or three others laying by her . Elinor drew near , but without saying a word ; and seating herself on the bed , took her hand , kissed her affectionately several times , and then gave way to a burst of tears , which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne 's .
John Willoughby	"Elinor , who knew that such grief , shocking as it was to witness it , must have its course , watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself , and then turning eagerly to Willoughby 's letter , read as follows : "" Bond Street , January . "" MY DEAR MADAM , "" I have just had the honour of receiving your letter , for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments ."
John Willoughby	I am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night
John Willoughby	and though I am quite at
John Willoughby	a loss to discover in what point I could be
John Willoughby	so unfortunate as to offend you , I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional .
John Willoughby	I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure , and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions .
John Willoughby	My esteem for your whole family is very sincere ; but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt , or meant to express , I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem .
John Willoughby	That I should ever have meant more you will allow to be impossible , when you understand that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere , and it will not be many weeks , I believe ,
John Willoughby	It is with great regret that I obey your commands in returning the letters with which I have been honoured from you , and the lock of hair , which you so obligingly bestowed on me .
John Willoughby	""" I am , dear Madam , "" Your most obedient "" humble servant , "" JOHN WILLOUGHBY . """
John Willoughby	Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever-- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings 's chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed .
John Willoughby	"if you knew!--And can you believe me to be so , while I see you so wretched ! "" "" Forgive me , forgive me , "" throwing her arms round her sister 's neck ; "" I know you feel for me ; I know what a heart you have ; but yet you are -- you must be happy ; Edward loves you -- what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ? "" "" Many , many circumstances , "" said Elinor , solemnly ."
John Willoughby	""" No , no , no , "" cried Marianne wildly , "" he loves you , and only you ."
John Willoughby	Much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period-- if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it . Every additional day of unhappy confidence , on your side , would have made the blow more dreadful .
John Willoughby	""" No , he is not so unworthy as you believe him ."
John Willoughby	"He has broken no faith with me . "" "" But he told you that he loved you ."
John Willoughby	"Yet you wrote to him?""-- "" Yes -- could that be wrong after all that had passed?-- But I can not talk . """
John Willoughby	"The first , which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town , was to this effect . Berkeley Street , January . "" How surprised you will be , Willoughby , on receiving this ; and I think you will feel something more than surprise , when you know that I am in town ."
John Willoughby	An opportunity of coming hither , though with Mrs. Jennings , was a temptation we could not resist . I wish you may receive this in time to come here to - night , but I will not depend on it .
John Willoughby	"The contents of her last note to him were these:-- "" What am I to imagine , Willoughby , by your behaviour last night ?"
John Willoughby	Again I demand an explanation of it . I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced , with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared to me to justify .
John Willoughby	I have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting ; but though I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour , I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it . You have perhaps been misinformed , or purposely deceived , in something concerning me , which may have lowered me in your opinion .
John Willoughby	Tell me what it is , explain the grounds on which you acted , and I shall be satisfied , in being able to satisfy you . It would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you ; but if I am to do it , if I am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you , that your regard for us all was insincere , that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive , let it be told as soon as possible .
John Willoughby	That such letters , so full of affection and confidence , could have been so answered , Elinor , for Willoughby 's sake , would have been unwilling to believe .
John Willoughby	But her condemnation of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their having been written at all ; and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs of tenderness , not warranted by anything preceding , and most severely condemned by the event , when Marianne , perceiving that she had finished the letters , observed to
John Willoughby	""" I felt myself , "" she added , "" to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other ."
John Willoughby	""" I can believe it , "" said Elinor ; "" but unfortunately he did not feel the same . """
John Willoughby	""" He DID feel the same , Elinor -- for weeks and weeks he felt it ."
John Willoughby	I know he did .
John Willoughby	Whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ) , I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish .
John Willoughby	This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment !
John Willoughby	When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again -- his distress -- can I ever forget his distress ?
John Willoughby	"For a moment or two she could say no more ; but when this emotion had passed away , she added , in a firmer tone , "" Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby . "" "" Dearest Marianne , who but himself ? By whom can he have been instigated ? "" "" By all the world , rather than by his own heart ."
John Willoughby	I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion , than believe his nature capable of such cruelty . This woman of whom he writes -- whoever she be -- or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and Edward ,
John Willoughby	Beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby , whose heart I know so well ?
John Willoughby	"Elinor was employed in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window , from the window to the fire , without knowing that she received warmth from one , or discerning objects through the other ; and Marianne , seated at the foot of the bed , with her head leaning against one of its posts , again took up Willoughby 's letter , and , after shuddering over every sentence , exclaimed-- "" It is too much !"
John Willoughby	Oh , Willoughby , Willoughby , could this be yours !
John Willoughby	Cruel , cruel -- nothing can acquit you .
John Willoughby	Whatever he might have heard against me-- ought he not to have suspended his belief ?
John Willoughby	ought he not to have told me of it , to have given me the power of clearing myself ?
John Willoughby	' The lock of hair , ( repeating it from the letter , ) which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable .
John Willoughby	Willoughby , where was your heart when you wrote those words ?
John Willoughby	"Oh , barbarously insolent!--Elinor , can he be justified ? "" "" No , Marianne , in no possible way . "" "" And yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been?--how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh !"
John Willoughby	no one , no one -- he talked to me only of myself .
John Willoughby	I came only for Willoughby 's sake -- and now who cares for me ?
John Willoughby	Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself , and at others , lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him .
John Willoughby	In one moment her imagination placed before her a letter from Willoughby , full of tenderness and contrition , explanatory of all that had passed , satisfactory , convincing ; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself , rushing eagerly into the room to inforce , at her feet , by the eloquence of his eyes , the assurances of his letter . The work of one moment was destroyed by the next .
John Willoughby	Willoughby filled every page .
John Willoughby	Her mother , still confident of their engagement , and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy , had only been roused by Elinor 's application , to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them both ; and this , with such tenderness towards her , such affection for Willoughby , and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other , that she wept with agony through the whole of it . All her impatience to be at home again now returned ; her mother was dearer to her than ever ; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby , and she was wildly urgent to be gone .
John Willoughby	Elinor , unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be in London or at Barton , offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother 's wishes could be known ; and at length she obtained her sister 's consent to wait for that knowledge .
John Willoughby	""" A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . "" The event proved her conjecture right , though it was founded on injustice and error ; for Colonel Brandon DID come in ; and Elinor , who was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither , and who saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look , and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her , could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly ."
John Willoughby	My object -- my wish -- my sole wish in desiring it -- I hope , I believe it is -- is to be a means of giving comfort;--no , I must not say comfort -- not present comfort -- but conviction , lasting conviction to your sister 's mind .
John Willoughby	My regard for her , for yourself , for your mother -- will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere regard -- nothing but an earnest desire of being useful -- I think I am justified -- though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right , is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong ?
John Willoughby	""" You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby , that will open his character farther ."
John Willoughby	This lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father .
John Willoughby	I can not remember the time when I did not love Eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt . Her 's , for me , was , I believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate . At seventeen she was lost to me for ever .
John Willoughby	She was married -- married against her inclination to my brother . Her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered .
John Willoughby	And this , I fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian .
John Willoughby	My brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her .
John Willoughby	I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing -- but how blindly I
John Willoughby	I was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father 's point was gained .
John Willoughby	I had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one--
John Willoughby	but had her marriage been happy , so young as I then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least I should not have now to lament it .
John Willoughby	My brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly .
John Willoughby	The consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon 's , was but too natural .
John Willoughby	She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned .
John Willoughby	But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ?
John Willoughby	"Had I remained in England , perhaps -- but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange . The shock which her marriage had given me , "" he continued , in a voice of great agitation , "" was of trifling weight -- was nothing to what I felt when I heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce . It was THAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection of what I suffered-- "" He could say no more , and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room . Elinor , affected by his relation , and still more by his distress , could not speak ."
John Willoughby	My first care , when I DID arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy .
John Willoughby	I could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin .
John Willoughby	Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person .
John Willoughby	He imagined , and calmly could he imagine it , that her extravagance , and consequent distress , had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief .
John Willoughby	At last , however , and after I had been six months in England , I DID find her .
John Willoughby	Regard for a former servant of my own , who had since fallen into misfortune , carried me to visit him in a spunging - house , where he was confined for debt ; and there , the same house , under a similar confinement , was my unfortunate sister .
John Willoughby	hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom I had once doted . What I endured in so beholding her -- but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it -- I have pained you too much already .
John Willoughby	That she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was -- yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort . Life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given .
John Willoughby	"I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life : I was with her in her last moments . "" Again he stopped to recover himself ; and Elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern , at the fate of his unfortunate friend ."
John Willoughby	""" Your sister , I hope , can not be offended , "" said he , "" by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation ."
John Willoughby	Their fates , their fortunes , can not be the same ; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind , or a happier marriage , she might have been all that you will live to see the other be .
John Willoughby	Miss Dashwood -- a subject such as this -- untouched for fourteen years -- it is dangerous to handle it at all !
John Willoughby	She left to my care her only child , a little girl , the offspring of her first guilty connection , who was then about three years old .
John Willoughby	She loved the child , and had always kept it with her .
John Willoughby	I saw her there whenever I could , and after the death of my brother , ( which happened about five years ago , and which left to me the possession of the family property , ) she visited me at Delaford .
John Willoughby	I called her a distant relation ; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her .
John Willoughby	It is now three years ago ( she had just reached her fourteenth year , ) that I removed her from school , to place her under the care of a very respectable woman , residing in Dorsetshire , who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life ; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation .
John Willoughby	But last February , almost a twelvemonth back , she suddenly disappeared .
John Willoughby	I had allowed her , ( imprudently , as it has since turned out , ) at her earnest desire , to go to Bath with one of her young friends , who was attending her father there for his health . I knew him to be a very good sort of man , and I thought well of his daughter -- better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill - judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all .
John Willoughby	He , her father , a well - meaning , but not a quick - sighted man , could really , I believe , give no information ; for he had been generally confined to the house , while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose ; and he tried to convince me , as thoroughly as he was convinced himself , of his daughter 's being entirely unconcerned in the business . In short , I could learn nothing but that she was gone ; all the rest , for eight long months , was left to conjecture .
John Willoughby	""" Good heavens ! "" cried Elinor , "" could it be -- could Willoughby!""-- "" The first news that reached me of her , "" he continued , "" came in a letter from herself , last October ."
John Willoughby	It was forwarded to me from Delaford , and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell ; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly , which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body , and which I believe gave offence to some . Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine , I suppose , when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party , that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable ; but HAD he known it , what would it have availed ?
John Willoughby	Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister ?
John Willoughby	No , he had already done that , which no man who CAN feel for another would do .
John Willoughby	He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced , in a situation of the utmost distress , with no creditable home , no help , no friends , ignorant of his address !
John Willoughby	He had left her , promising to return ; he neither returned , nor wrote , nor relieved her .
John Willoughby	""" "" This is beyond every thing ! "" exclaimed Elinor ."
John Willoughby	""" His character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both ."
John Willoughby	Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it .
John Willoughby	To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister -- but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister 's influence might yet reclaim him .
John Willoughby	Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self - reproach , which must attend her through life .
John Willoughby	She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing .
John Willoughby	Concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment .
John Willoughby	Use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what I have told you .
John Willoughby	You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others .
John Willoughby	""" I have been more pained , "" said she , "" by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier ."
John Willoughby	"Have you , "" she continued , after a short silence , "" ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton ?"
John Willoughby	"Elinor , startled by his manner , looked at him anxiously , saying , "" What ? have you met him to-- "" "" I could meet him no other way ."
John Willoughby	Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct .
John Willoughby	"and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust ! "" "" Is she still in town ? "" """
John Willoughby	"No ; as soon as she recovered from her lying - in , for I found her near her delivery , I removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains . "" Recollecting , soon afterwards , that he was probably dividing Elinor from her sister , he put an end to his visit , receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments , and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him ."
John Willoughby	He has been very deceitful !
John Willoughby	"and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him . "" "" Ah ! "" said Colonel Brandon , "" there is , indeed !"
John Willoughby	"But your sister does not -- I think you said so -- she does not consider quite as you do ? """
John Willoughby	""" You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . "" He made no answer ; and soon afterwards , by the removal of the tea - things , and the arrangement of the card parties , the subject was necessarily dropped ."
John Willoughby	Mrs. Jennings , who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking , and who expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood 's communication , in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon 's side , as might have become a man in the bloom of youth , of hope and happiness , saw him , with amazement , remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual .
John Willoughby	47 Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite . She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt;--she was sorry for him;--she wished him happy .
John Willoughby	But the feelings of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken -- a character unblemished , to Marianne .
John Willoughby	Nothing could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his means , nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza .
John Willoughby	Nothing could replace him , therefore , in her former esteem , nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon .
John Willoughby	Had Mrs. Dashwood , like her daughter , heard Willoughby 's story from himself -- had she witnessed his distress , and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner , it is probable that her compassion would have been greater .
John Willoughby	But it was neither in Elinor 's power , nor in her wish , to rouse such feelings in another , by her retailed explanation , as had at first been called forth in herself . Reflection had given calmness to her judgment , and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby 's deserts;-- she wished , therefore , to declare only the simple truth , and lay open such facts as were really due to his character , without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray .
John Willoughby	"In the evening , when they were all three together , Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;-- but that it was not without an effort , the restless , unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting -- her rising colour , as she spoke,-- and her unsteady voice , plainly shewed . """
John Willoughby	I never could have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later I must have known , all this.--I should have had no confidence , no esteem .
John Willoughby	""" Happy with a man of libertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends , and the best of men!--No -- my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience , her sensitive conscience , would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt . """
John Willoughby	""" You consider the matter , "" said Elinor , "" exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it ; and I dare say you perceive , as well as myself , not only in this , but in many other circumstances , reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments , in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection , on his side , much less certain ."
John Willoughby	His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self - denial is a word hardly understood by him . His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before .
John Willoughby	"YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you , I know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that-- and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge HIS enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ? """
John Willoughby	"Marianne 's lips quivered , and she repeated the word "" Selfish ? "" in a tone that implied--""do you really think him selfish ? """
John Willoughby	""" The whole of his behaviour , "" replied Elinor , "" from the beginning to the end of the affair , has been grounded on selfishness ."
John Willoughby	It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections ; which afterwards , when his own were engaged , made him delay the confession of it , and which finally carried him from Barton .
John Willoughby	"His own enjoyment , or his own ease , was , in every particular , his ruling principle . "" "" It is very true ."
John Willoughby	"MY happiness never was his object . "" "" At present , "" continued Elinor , "" he regrets what he has done ."
John Willoughby	And why does he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towards himself .
John Willoughby	It has not made him happy . His circumstances are now unembarrassed -- he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself . But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have been different .
John Willoughby	He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing .
John Willoughby	He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous -- always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife .
John Willoughby	"Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor , satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister 's spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued , "" One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby 's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams ."
John Willoughby	"That crime has been the origin of every lesser one , and of all his present discontents . "" Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark ; and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon 's injuries and merits , warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate . Her daughter did not look , however , as if much of it were heard by her ."
John Willoughby	"Their man - servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business ; and when , as he waited at table , he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand , this was his voluntary communication-- "" I suppose you know , ma'am , that Mr. Ferrars is married . """
John Willoughby	and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the maid , returned to Elinor , who , though still much disordered , had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas , as to the source of his intelligence . Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself ; and Elinor
John Willoughby	""" Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married , Thomas ?"
John Willoughby	""" "" I see Mr. Ferrars myself , ma'am , this morning in Exeter , and his lady too , Miss Steele as was ."
John Willoughby	"and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma'am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars 's , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they 'd make sure to come and see you . "" "" But did she tell you she was married , Thomas ?"
John Willoughby	"So , I made free to wish her joy . "" "" Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her ?"
John Willoughby	""" Yes , ma'am , I just see him leaning back in it , but he did not look up;--he never was a gentleman much for talking . """
John Willoughby	Elinor 's heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward ; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation .
John Willoughby	Thomas 's intelligence seemed over .
John Willoughby	"Elinor looked as if she wished to hear more . "" Did you see them off , before you came away ? """
John Willoughby	""" No , ma'am -- the horses were just coming out , but I could not bide any longer ; I was afraid of being late . "" "" Did Mrs. Ferrars look well ? "" "" Yes , ma'am , she said how she was very well ; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady -- and she seemed vastly contented . "" Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question , and Thomas and the tablecloth , now alike needless , were soon afterwards dismissed ."
John Willoughby	She managed the recital , as she hoped , with address ; prepared her anxious listener with caution ; related simply and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby grounded his apology ; did justice to his repentance , and softened only his protestations of present regard .
John Willoughby	Elinor , dreading her being tired , led her towards home ; and till they reached the door of the cottage , easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it , talked of nothing but Willoughby , and their conversation together ; and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look , where minuteness could be safely indulged .
John Willoughby	""" If you would but let us know what your business is , "" said Mrs. Jennings , "" we might see whether it could be put off or not . "" "" You would not be six hours later , "" said Willoughby , "" if you were to defer your journey till our return . "" "" I can not afford to lose ONE hour . ""-- Elinor then heard Willoughby say , in a low voice to Marianne , "" There are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . Brandon is one of them ."
John Willoughby	He was afraid of catching cold I dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it .
John Willoughby	I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing .
John Willoughby	Consider , here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton , the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to Whitwell .
John Willoughby	The carriages were then ordered ; Willoughby 's was first , and Marianne never looked happier than when she got into it .
John Willoughby	He drove through the park very fast , and they were soon out of sight ; and nothing more of them was seen till their return , which did not happen till after the return of all the rest . They both seemed delighted with their drive ; but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes , while the others went on the downs . It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening , and that every body should be extremely merry all day long .
John Willoughby	Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods .
John Willoughby	"Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor 's right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and Willoughby , and said to Marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , "" I have found you out in spite of all your tricks ."
John Willoughby	""" -- "" Did not you know , "" said Willoughby , "" that we had been out in my curricle ? "" "" Yes , yes , Mr. Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne . It is a very large one , I know ; and when I come to see you , I hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago . "" Marianne turned away in great confusion ."
John Willoughby	Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily ; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby 's groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house . Elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose , or Marianne consent , to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was in it , with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance . As soon as they left the dining - room , Elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true .
John Willoughby	""" Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby . "" "" Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion ."
John Willoughby	"They will one day be Mr. Willoughby 's , and-- "" "" If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . "" She blushed at this hint ; but it was even visibly gratifying to her ; and after a ten minutes ' interval of earnest thought , she came to her sister again , and said with great good humour , "" Perhaps , Elinor , it WAS rather ill - judged in me to go to Allenham ; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place ; and it is a charming house , I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful ."
John Willoughby	I did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up -- a couple of hundred pounds , Willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in England .
John Willoughby	15 Mrs. Dashwood 's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day , and two of her daughters went with her ; but Marianne excused herself from being of the party , under some trifling pretext of employment ; and her mother , who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent , was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home . On their return from the park they found Willoughby 's curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage , and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just .
John Willoughby	"Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted , where they found only Willoughby , who was leaning against the mantel - piece with his back towards them . He turned round on their coming in , and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over - powered Marianne . "" Is anything the matter with her ? "" cried Mrs. Dashwood as she entered--""is she ill ? "" "" I hope not , "" he replied , trying to look cheerful ; and with a forced smile presently added , "" It is I who may rather expect to be ill -- for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment ! """
John Willoughby	""" Disappointment ? "" "" Yes , for I am unable to keep my engagement with you . Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin , by sending me on business to London . I have just received my dispatches , and taken my farewell of Allenham ; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you . "" "" To London!--and are you going this morning ? "" "" Almost this moment . "" "" This is very unfortunate ."
John Willoughby	"But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from us long I hope . "" He coloured as he replied , "" You are very kind , but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately ."
John Willoughby	"For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ? "" His colour increased ; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied , "" You are too good . """
John Willoughby	""" I have only to add , my dear Willoughby , that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for I will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith ; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination . """
John Willoughby	""" My engagements at present , "" replied Willoughby , confusedly , "" are of such a nature -- that -- I dare not flatter myself""-- He stopt ."
John Willoughby	"This was broken by Willoughby , who said with a faint smile , "" It is folly to linger in this manner ."
John Willoughby	"I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy . """
John Willoughby	He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room . They saw him step into his carriage , and in a minute it was out of sight .
John Willoughby	Willoughby 's behaviour in taking leave of them , his embarrassment , and affectation of cheerfulness , and , above all , his unwillingness to accept her mother 's invitation , a backwardness so unlike a lover , so unlike himself , greatly disturbed her .
John Willoughby	One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side ; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for , though when she considered what Marianne 's love for him was , a quarrel seemed almost impossible . But whatever might be the particulars of their separation , her sister 's affliction was indubitable ; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief , but feeding and encouraging as a duty . In about half an hour her mother returned , and though her eyes were red , her countenance was not uncheerful .
John Willoughby	""" Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton , Elinor , "" said she , as she sat down to work , "" and with how heavy a heart does he travel ?"
John Willoughby	And last night he was with us so happy , so cheerful , so affectionate ?
John Willoughby	He did not speak , he did not behave like himself .
John Willoughby	"Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?""-- "" It was not inclination that he wanted , Elinor ; I could plainly see THAT ."
John Willoughby	He had not the power of accepting it .
John Willoughby	I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him , ) and on that account is eager to get him away;-- and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him . This is what I believe to have happened . He is , moreover , aware that she DOES disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from Devonshire for a while . You will tell me , I know , that this may or may NOT have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this .
John Willoughby	You are resolved to think him blameable , because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn . And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ? Are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ? Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love , and no reason in the world to think ill of ?
John Willoughby	"And , after all , what is it you suspect him of ? "" "" I can hardly tell myself ."
John Willoughby	But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him .
John Willoughby	There is great truth , however , in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him , and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body . Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct , and I will hope that he has .
John Willoughby	But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once .
John Willoughby	"Secrecy may be advisable ; but still I can not help wondering at its being practiced by him . "" "" Do not blame him , however , for departing from his character , where the deviation is necessary ."
John Willoughby	"But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence?--I am happy -- and he is acquitted . """
John Willoughby	It may be proper to conceal their engagement ( if they ARE engaged ) from Mrs. Smith-- and if that is the case , it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present . But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us .
John Willoughby	my dear child , do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment ?
John Willoughby	Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us , for at least the last fortnight , declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife , and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation ? Have we not perfectly understood each other ?
John Willoughby	Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks , his manner , his attentive and affectionate respect ?
John Willoughby	How is it to be supposed that Willoughby , persuaded as he must be of your sister 's love , should leave her , and leave her perhaps for months , without telling her of his affection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence ?
John Willoughby	You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby , if , after all that has openly passed between them , you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together .
John Willoughby	Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time ?
John Willoughby	Do you suppose him really indifferent to her ?
John Willoughby	""" "" No , I can not think that . He must and does love her I am sure ."
John Willoughby	""" "" But with a strange kind of tenderness , if he can leave her with such indifference , such carelessness of the future , as you attribute to him . "" "" You must remember , my dear mother , that I have never considered this matter as certain ."
John Willoughby	I have had my doubts , I confess ; but they are fainter than they were , and they may soon be entirely done away .
John Willoughby	It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect . But why ? Is he not a man of honour and feeling ?
John Willoughby	Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm ?
John Willoughby	can he be deceitful ?
John Willoughby	""" I love Willoughby , sincerely love him ; and suspicion of his integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me . It has been involuntary , and I will not encourage it ."
John Willoughby	I was startled , I confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality .
John Willoughby	"But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed . He had just parted from my sister , had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction ; and if he felt obliged , from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith , to resist the temptation of returning here soon , and yet aware that by declining your invitation , by saying that he was going away for some time , he should seem to act an ungenerous , a suspicious part by our family , be might well be embarrassed and disturbed . In such a case , a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think , as well as more consistent with his general character;--but I will not raise objections against any one 's conduct on so illiberal a foundation , as a difference in judgment from myself , or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent . """
John Willoughby	Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected .
John Willoughby	Though WE have not known him long , he is no stranger in this part of the world ; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage ?
John Willoughby	Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately , it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once : but this is not the case .
John Willoughby	The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby overpowered her in an instant ; and though her family were most anxiously attentive to her comfort , it was impossible for them , if they spoke at all , to keep clear of every subject which her feelings connected with him .
John Willoughby	"27 "" If this open weather holds much longer , "" said Mrs. Jennings , when they met at breakfast the following morning , "" Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week ; ' tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day 's pleasure . Poor souls !"
John Willoughby	""" At any rate , "" said Elinor , wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister 's thoughts as clearly as she did , "" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week ."
John Willoughby	Colonel Brandon , who had a general invitation to the house , was with them almost every day ; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor , who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence , but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister . She feared it was a strengthening regard .
John Willoughby	It grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne , and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton .
John Willoughby	About a week after their arrival , it became certain that Willoughby was also arrived .
John Willoughby	His card was on the table when they came in from the morning 's drive .
John Willoughby	""" Good God ! "" cried Marianne , "" he has been here while we were out . """
John Willoughby	"Elinor , rejoiced to be assured of his being in London , now ventured to say , """
John Willoughby	Depend upon it , he will call again tomorrow
John Willoughby	From this moment her mind was never quiet ; the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day , made her unfit for any thing .
John Willoughby	Elinor 's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street during their absence ; but a moment 's glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her , that Willoughby had paid no second visit there .
John Willoughby	It was from Lady Middleton , announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before , and requesting the company of her mother and cousins the following evening . Business on Sir John 's part , and a violent cold on her own , prevented their calling in Berkeley Street .
John Willoughby	The invitation was accepted ; but when the hour of appointment drew near , necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings , that they should both attend her on such a visit , Elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go , for still she had seen nothing of Willoughby ; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad , than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence .
John Willoughby	Elinor found , when the evening was over , that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode , for although scarcely settled in town , Sir John had contrived to collect around him , nearly twenty young people , and to amuse them with a ball . This was an affair , however , of which Lady Middleton did not approve .
John Willoughby	He looked at them slightly , without seeming to know who they were , and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the room . Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered : it was enough -- HE was not there -- and she sat down , equally ill - disposed to receive or communicate pleasure . After they had been assembled about an hour , Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town , though Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house , and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come .
John Willoughby	""" I thought you were both in Devonshire , "" said he ."
John Willoughby	""" Did you ? "" replied Elinor ."
John Willoughby	""" When do you go back again ? "" "" I do not know . """
John Willoughby	""" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . "" Marianne said no more , but looked exceedingly hurt . Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister 's relief , Elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother , and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne , to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed ; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow , that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby , for she could not suppose it to be to any other person . About the middle of the day , Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on business , and Elinor began her letter directly , while Marianne , too restless for employment , too anxious for conversation , walked from one window to the other , or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation ."
John Willoughby	Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother , relating all that had passed , her suspicions of Willoughby 's inconstancy , urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him . Her letter was scarcely finished , when a rap foretold a visitor , and Colonel Brandon was announced .
John Willoughby	Marianne , who had seen him from the window , and who hated company of any kind , left the room before he entered it .
John Willoughby	He looked more than usually grave , and though expressing satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone , as if he had somewhat in particular to tell her , sat for some time without saying a word .
John Willoughby	Elinor , persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned , impatiently expected its opening .
John Willoughby	"It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction ; for , more than once before , beginning with the observation of "" your sister looks unwell to - day , "" or "" your sister seems out of spirits , "" he had appeared on the point , either of disclosing , or of inquiring , something particular about her . After a pause of several minutes , their silence was broken , by his asking her in a voice of some agitation , when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother ?"
John Willoughby	Elinor was not prepared for such a question , and having no answer ready , was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient , of asking what he meant ?
John Willoughby	"He tried to smile as he replied , "" your sister 's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known . """
John Willoughby	""" It can not be generally known , "" returned Elinor , "" for her own family do not know it . "" He looked surprised and said , "" I beg your pardon , I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of ."
John Willoughby	But still I might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister 's writing .
John Willoughby	I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question .
John Willoughby	But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding .
John Willoughby	Excuse me , Miss Dashwood .
John Willoughby	I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence .
John Willoughby	"Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains . """
John Willoughby	These words , which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister , affected her very much .
John Willoughby	The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known to herself , that in endeavouring to explain it , she might be as liable to say too much as too little .
John Willoughby	Yet as she was convinced that Marianne 's affection for Willoughby , could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon 's success , whatever the event of that affection might be , and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure , she thought it most prudent and kind , after some consideration , to say more than she really knew or believed . She acknowledged , therefore , that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other , of their mutual affection she had no doubt , and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear .
John Willoughby	"He listened to her with silent attention , and on her ceasing to speak , rose directly from his seat , and after saying in a voice of emotion , "" to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her,""--took leave , and went away"
John Willoughby	Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation , to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points ; she was left , on the contrary , with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon 's unhappiness , and was prevented even from wishing it removed , by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it .
Thomas Palmer	21 The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day , and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain each other . But this did not last long ; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head , had hardly done wondering at Charlotte 's being so happy without a cause , at Mr. Palmer 's acting so simply , with good abilities , and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife , before Sir John 's and Mrs. Jennings 's active zeal in the cause of society , procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe .
Thomas Palmer	In a morning 's excursion to Exeter , they had met with two young ladies , whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations , and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to the park , as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over . Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation , and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the return of Sir John , by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life , and of whose elegance,-- whose tolerable gentility even , she could have no proof ; for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all .
Thomas Palmer	How can you be so cross as not to come ? Why they are your cousins , you know , after a fashion . YOU are my cousins , and they are my wife 's , so you must be related .
Thomas Palmer	""" And here is my sweet little Annamaria , "" she added , tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old , who had not made a noise for the last two minutes ; "" And she is always so gentle and quiet -- Never was there such a quiet little thing ! """
Thomas Palmer	But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces , a pin in her ladyship 's head dress slightly scratching the child 's neck , produced from this pattern of gentleness such violent screams , as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy . The mother 's consternation was excessive ; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles , and every thing was done by all three , in so critical an emergency , which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer . She was seated in her mother 's lap , covered with kisses , her wound bathed with lavender - water , by one of the Miss Steeles , who was on her knees to attend her , and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other
Thomas Palmer	She still screamed and sobbed lustily , kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her , and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week , some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple , the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch , and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it , gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.-- She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother 's arms , in quest of this medicine , and as the two boys chose to follow , though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind , the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours .
Thomas Palmer	""" Poor little creatures ! "" said Miss Steele , as soon as they were gone ."
Thomas Palmer	"A short pause succeeded this speech , which was first broken by Miss Steele , who seemed very much disposed for conversation , and who now said rather abruptly , "" And how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex . """
Thomas Palmer	""" Norland is a prodigious beautiful place , is not it ? "" added Miss Steele ."
Thomas Palmer	""" "" But why should you think , "" said Lucy , looking ashamed of her sister , "" that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex ? "" "" Nay , my dear , I 'm sure I do n't pretend to say that there an't ."
Thomas Palmer	""" Upon my word , "" replied Elinor , "" I can not tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word ."
Thomas Palmer	And then to turn the discourse , she began admiring the house and the furniture .
Thomas Palmer	The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation , and as Elinor was not blinded by the beauty , or the shrewd look of the youngest , to her want of real elegance and artlessness , she left the house without any wish of knowing them better .
Thomas Palmer	your sister - in - law 's brother , Miss Dashwood ?
Thomas Palmer	"Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle 's , it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well . "" Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise ."
Thomas Palmer	"To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do . "" "" But I do assure you it was so , for all that , and I will tell you how it happened ."
Thomas Palmer	When we met him , he turned back and walked with us ; and so we began talking of my brother and sister , and one thing and another , and I said to him , ' So , Colonel , there is a new family come to Barton cottage , I hear , and mama sends me word they are very pretty , and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna .
Thomas Palmer	""" Mr. Brandon was very well I hope ? "" "" Oh !"
Thomas Palmer	However , I do n't think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night .
Thomas Palmer	""" Mrs. Palmer 's information respecting Willoughby was not very material ; but any testimony in his favour , however small , was pleasing to her ."
Thomas Palmer	You ca n't think how much I longed to see you !
Thomas Palmer	And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married !
Thomas Palmer	I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna .
Thomas Palmer	""" "" You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon , have not you ?"
Thomas Palmer	""" Yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married.--"
Thomas Palmer	"I believe , "" she added in a low voice , "" he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could ."
Thomas Palmer	"But mama did not think the match good enough for me , otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel , and we should have been married immediately . """
Thomas Palmer	""" Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John 's proposal to your mother before it was made ? Had he never owned his affection to yourself ?"
Thomas Palmer	""" Oh , no ; but if mama had not objected to it , I dare say he would have liked it of all things ."
Thomas Palmer	He had not seen me then above twice , for it was before I left school .
Thomas Palmer	However , I am much happier as I am .
Thomas Palmer	"Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like . """
Thomas Palmer	"Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight , that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her ; and , contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day , returned from that period to her own home , and her own habits , in which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share . About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street , Mrs. Jennings , on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer , entered the drawing - room , where Elinor was sitting by herself , with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful ; and giving her time only to form that idea , began directly to justify it , by saying , "" Lord !"
Thomas Palmer	But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr. Palmer 's , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child .
Thomas Palmer	' I wish , with all my heart , ' says poor Fanny in her affectionate way , ' that we had asked your sisters instead of them . '
Thomas Palmer	This would not , in itself , have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself , as , joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy , induced her to accept it with pleasure .
Thomas Palmer	In the country , an unpremeditated dance was very allowable ; but in London , where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained , it was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls , to have it known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple , with two violins , and a mere side - board collation . Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party ; from the former , whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town , as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother - in - law , and therefore never came near her , they received no mark of recognition on their entrance .
Thomas Palmer	He looked at them slightly , without seeming to know who they were , and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the room . Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered : it was enough -- HE was not there -- and she sat down , equally ill - disposed to receive or communicate pleasure . After they had been assembled about an hour , Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town , though Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house , and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come .
Charlotte Palmer	21 The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day , and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain each other . But this did not last long ; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head , had hardly done wondering at Charlotte 's being so happy without a cause , at Mr. Palmer 's acting so simply , with good abilities , and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife , before Sir John 's and Mrs. Jennings 's active zeal in the cause of society , procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe .
Charlotte Palmer	""" I am so glad we are got acquainted at last , "" continued Charlotte.--""And now I hope we shall always be great friends ."
Charlotte Palmer	Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton , and totally unlike her in every respect .
Charlotte Palmer	She was short and plump , had a very pretty face , and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be . Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister 's , but they were much more prepossessing .
Charlotte Palmer	She came in with a smile , smiled all the time of her visit , except when she laughed , and smiled when she went away . Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty , with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife , but of less willingness to please or be pleased .
Charlotte Palmer	Mrs. Palmer , on the contrary , who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy , was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth .
Charlotte Palmer	I never saw anything so charming !
Charlotte Palmer	Only think , Mamma , how it is improved since I was here last !
Charlotte Palmer	I always thought it such a sweet place , ma'am !
Charlotte Palmer	but you have made it so charming ! Only look , sister , how delightful every thing is !
Charlotte Palmer	How I should like such a house for myself !
Charlotte Palmer	Mrs. Jennings , in the meantime , talked on as loud as she could , and continued her account of their surprise , the evening before , on seeing their friends , without ceasing till every thing was told . Mrs. Palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment , and every body agreed , two or three times over , that it had been quite an agreeable surprise .
Charlotte Palmer	"Mrs. Palmer laughed , and said it would not do her any harm . "" She expects to be confined in February , "" continued Mrs. Jennings . Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation , and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in the paper . "" No , none at all , "" he replied , and read on ."
Charlotte Palmer	""" Now , Palmer , you shall see a monstrous pretty girl . """
Charlotte Palmer	He immediately went into the passage , opened the front door , and ushered her in himself . Mrs. Jennings asked her , as soon as she appeared , if she had not been to Allenham ; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question , as to show she understood it .
Charlotte Palmer	Mr. Palmer looked up on her entering the room , stared at her some minutes , and then returned to his newspaper . Mrs. Palmer 's eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room . She got up to examine them .
Charlotte Palmer	"I declare they are quite charming ; I could look at them for ever . """
Charlotte Palmer	And then sitting down again , she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room .
Charlotte Palmer	""" My love , have you been asleep ? "" said his wife , laughing ."
Charlotte Palmer	He made her no answer ; and only observed , after again examining the room , that it was very low pitched , and that the ceiling was crooked . He then made his bow , and departed with the rest .
Charlotte Palmer	, was very urgent to prevent her sister 's going at all ; and Mrs. Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor 's service , so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward 's part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again . The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tete - a - tete with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike .
Charlotte Palmer	She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room , and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful .
Charlotte Palmer	"He came , examined his patient , and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health , yet , by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency , and allowing the word "" infection "" to pass his lips , gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer , on her baby 's account . Mrs. Jennings , who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne 's complaint more serious than Elinor , now looked very grave on Mr. Harris 's report , and confirming Charlotte 's fears and caution , urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant ; and Mr. Palmer , though treating their apprehensions as idle , found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood ."
Charlotte Palmer	The distress of her sister too , particularly a favourite , was before her;--and as for their mother , when Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to herself , her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere .
Charlotte Palmer	But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr. Palmer 's , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child .
Charlotte Palmer	She was sure it was very ill -- it cried , and fretted , and was all over pimples . So I looked at it directly , and , ' Lord ! my dear , ' says I , ' it is nothing in the world , but the red gum--
Charlotte Palmer	and nurse said just the same . But Charlotte , she would not be satisfied , so Mr. Donavan was sent for ; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street , so he stepped over directly , and as soon as ever he saw the child , be said just as we did , that it was nothing in the world but the red gum , and then Charlotte was easy .
Lady Middleton	In a morning 's excursion to Exeter , they had met with two young ladies , whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations , and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to the park , as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over . Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation , and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the return of Sir John , by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life , and of whose elegance,-- whose tolerable gentility even , she could have no proof ; for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all .
Lady Middleton	Their being her relations too made it so much the worse ; and Mrs. Jennings 's attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded , when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable ; because they were all cousins and must put up with one another .
Lady Middleton	As it was impossible , however , now to prevent their coming , Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it , with all the philosophy of a well - bred woman , contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times every day .
Lady Middleton	The young ladies arrived : their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable . Their dress was very smart , their manners very civil , they were delighted with the house , and in raptures with the furniture , and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady Middleton 's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had been an hour at the Park .
Lady Middleton	She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed , which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration .
Lady Middleton	took place , they found in the appearance of the eldest , who was nearly thirty , with a very plain and not a sensible face , nothing to admire ; but in the other , who was not more than two or three and twenty , they acknowledged considerable beauty ; her features were pretty , and she had a sharp quick eye , and a smartness of air , which though it did not give actual elegance or grace , gave distinction to her person.-- Their manners were particularly civil , and Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense , when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton .
Lady Middleton	With her children they were in continual raptures , extolling their beauty , courting their notice , and humouring their whims ; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it , was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing , if she happened to be doing any thing , or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress , in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight .
Lady Middleton	Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles , a fond mother , though , in pursuit of praise for her children , the most rapacious of human beings , is likewise the most credulous ; her demands are exorbitant ; but she will swallow any thing ; and the excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust .
Lady Middleton	She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted .
Lady Middleton	She saw their sashes untied , their hair pulled about their ears , their work - bags searched , and their knives and scissors stolen away , and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment . It suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by , without claiming a share in what was passing .
Lady Middleton	""" John is in such spirits today ! "" said she , on his taking Miss Steeles 's pocket handkerchief , and throwing it out of window--""He is full of monkey tricks . """
Lady Middleton	"And soon afterwards , on the second boy 's violently pinching one of the same lady 's fingers , she fondly observed , "" How playful William is ! """
Lady Middleton	""" And here is my sweet little Annamaria , "" she added , tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old , who had not made a noise for the last two minutes ; "" And she is always so gentle and quiet -- Never was there such a quiet little thing ! """
Lady Middleton	But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces , a pin in her ladyship 's head dress slightly scratching the child 's neck , produced from this pattern of gentleness such violent screams , as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy . The mother 's consternation was excessive ; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles , and every thing was done by all three , in so critical an emergency , which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer . She was seated in her mother 's lap , covered with kisses , her wound bathed with lavender - water , by one of the Miss Steeles , who was on her knees to attend her , and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other
Lady Middleton	She still screamed and sobbed lustily , kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her , and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week , some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple , the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch , and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it , gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.-- She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother 's arms , in quest of this medicine , and as the two boys chose to follow , though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind , the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours .
Lady Middleton	""" "" What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is ! "" said Lucy Steele ."
Lady Middleton	She did her best when thus called on , by speaking of Lady Middleton with more warmth than she felt , though with far less than Miss Lucy .
Lady Middleton	Here too , Miss Dashwood 's commendation , being only simple and just , came in without any eclat .
Lady Middleton	She merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly .
Lady Middleton	"I never saw such fine children in my life.--I declare I quite doat upon them already , and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children . """
Lady Middleton	""" I have a notion , "" said Lucy , "" you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton ; and for my part , I love to see children full of life and spirits ; I can not bear them if they are tame and quiet . """
Lady Middleton	Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much .
Lady Middleton	Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings ,
Lady Middleton	"I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again""-- Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John ."
Lady Middleton	Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton , and totally unlike her in every respect .
Lady Middleton	"Mrs. Palmer laughed , and said it would not do her any harm . "" She expects to be confined in February , "" continued Mrs. Jennings . Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation , and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in the paper . "" No , none at all , "" he replied , and read on ."
Lady Middleton	When Lady Middleton rose to go away , Mr. Palmer rose also , laid down the newspaper , stretched himself and looked at them all around .
Lady Middleton	""" My love , have you been asleep ? "" said his wife , laughing ."
Lady Middleton	Lady Middleton too , though she did not press their mother , pressed them .
Lady Middleton	Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse .
Lady Middleton	Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent .
Lady Middleton	Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady Middleton 's head ; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for a general chat , and none at all for particular discourse .
Lady Middleton	One or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private , when Sir John called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles . Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother 's permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise .
Lady Middleton	The young ladies went , and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her .
Lady Middleton	The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected ; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression , and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room : to the latter , the children accompanied them , and while they remained there , she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy 's attention to attempt it . They quitted it only with the removal of the tea - things .
Lady Middleton	""" I am glad , "" said Lady Middleton to Lucy , "" you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria 's basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight ."
Lady Middleton	And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to - morrow , and then I hope she will not much mind it .
Lady Middleton	"This hint was enough , Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied , "" Indeed you are very much mistaken , Lady Middleton ; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me , or I should have been at my filigree already ."
Lady Middleton	I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card - table now , I am resolved to finish the basket after supper .
Lady Middleton	""" You are very good , I hope it wo n't hurt your eyes-- will you ring the bell for some working candles ?"
Lady Middleton	My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed , I know , if the basket was not finished tomorrow , for though I told her it certainly would not , I am sure she depends
Lady Middleton	Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others .
Lady Middleton	"No one made any objection but Marianne , who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility , exclaimed , "" Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME -- you know I detest cards ."
Lady Middleton	Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never made so rude a speech .
Lady Middleton	""" Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma'am , "" said Elinor , endeavouring to smooth away the offence ; "" and I do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano - forte I ever heard . """
Lady Middleton	""" You are very kind , "" said Lady Middleton to Elinor ; "" and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ? """
Lady Middleton	Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals , and thus by a little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to practise , gained her own end , and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time .
Lady Middleton	The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress 's arrival ; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John 's description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own .
Lady Middleton	Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage .
Lady Middleton	The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley , but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill . The house was large and handsome ; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance . The former was for Sir John 's gratification , the latter for that of his lady .
Lady Middleton	They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood .
Lady Middleton	Sir John was a sportsman , Lady Middleton a mother .
Lady Middleton	He hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources .
Lady Middleton	Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round , while Sir John 's independent employments were in existence only half the time .
Lady Middleton	Continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of Sir John , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife .
Lady Middleton	Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table , and of all her domestic arrangements ; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties .
Lady Middleton	But Sir John 's satisfaction in society was much more real ; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold , and the noisier they were the better was he pleased .
Lady Middleton	Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by Sir John , who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity ; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before , at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them .
Lady Middleton	They would see , he said , only one gentleman there besides himself ; a particular friend who was staying at the park , but who was neither very young nor very gay . He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party , and could assure them it should never happen so again .
Lady Middleton	Luckily Lady Middleton 's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . The young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . Mrs. Jennings , Lady Middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . She was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . Marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs. Jennings 's . Colonel Brandon , the friend of Sir John , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than Lady Middleton was to be his wife , or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton 's mother . He was silent and grave .
Lady Middleton	There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother - in - law was interesting .
Lady Middleton	Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner , who pulled her about , tore her clothes , and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves .
Lady Middleton	In the evening , as Marianne was discovered to be musical , she was invited to play . The instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and Marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother 's account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it .
Lady Middleton	Lady Middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one 's attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished .
Lady Middleton	Colonel Brandon alone , of all the party , heard her without being in raptures .
Lady Middleton	He paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste .
Lady Middleton	His pleasure in music , though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own , was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others ; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment .
Lady Middleton	She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel 's advanced state of life which humanity required .
Lady Middleton	They were , of course , very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend ; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes .
Lady Middleton	Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty ; her face was handsome , her figure tall and striking , and her address graceful .
Lady Middleton	Her manners had all the elegance which her husband 's wanted . But they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by shewing that , though perfectly well - bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common - place inquiry or remark .
Lady Middleton	Conversation however was not wanted , for Sir John was very chatty , and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a fine little boy about six years old , by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to enquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions which his mother
Lady Middleton	answered for him , while he hung about her and held down his head , to the great surprise of her ladyship , who wondered at his being so shy before company , as he could make noise enough at home .
Lady Middleton	On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party , by way of provision for discourse . In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother , and in what particular he resembled either , for of course every body differed , and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others .
Lady Middleton	An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children , as Sir John would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day .
Lady Middleton	She wondered that Lucy 's spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was NOT ELINOR , appear a compliment to herself -- or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her , because her real situation was unknown .
Lady Middleton	But that it was so , had not only been declared by Lucy 's eyes at the time , but was declared over again the next morning more openly , for at her particular desire , Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone , to tell her how happy she was .
Lady Middleton	"But it seemed to satisfy Lucy , for she directly replied , "" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward 's love , it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton 's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;-- and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me.--"
Lady Middleton	for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may . I should not wonder , if he was to be in the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same .
Lady Middleton	It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart , that she had asked these young women to her house ; merely because she thought they deserved some attention , were harmless , well - behaved girls , and would be pleasant companions ; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us , while your kind friend there , was attending her daughter .
Lady Middleton	And now to be so rewarded !
Lady Middleton	"Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ? Come , come , this wo n't do . Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long . I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte . "" "" Indeed , Ma'am , "" said Elinor , very seriously , "" you are mistaken . Indeed , you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report , and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now ."
Lady Middleton	"You CAN have no grief . "" "" I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state ."
Lady Middleton	We were last night at Lady Middleton 's , where there was a dance .
Lady Middleton	her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written in the same situation
Lady Middleton	The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton !
Lady Middleton	I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . I suppose Lady Middleton wo n't ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here .
Lady Middleton	""" I hope he has had no bad news , "" said Lady Middleton . """
Lady Middleton	It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly .
Lady Middleton	""" My dear madam , "" said Lady Middleton , "" recollect what you are saying . "" "" Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married ? "" said Mrs. Jennings , without attending to her daughter 's reproof ."
Lady Middleton	""" I am particularly sorry , ma'am , "" said he , addressing Lady Middleton , "" that I should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town ."
Lady Middleton	Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being delighted , which was putting herself rather out of her way ; and as for the Miss Steeles , especially Lucy , they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them .
Lady Middleton	15 Mrs. Dashwood 's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day , and two of her daughters went with her ; but Marianne excused herself from being of the party , under some trifling pretext of employment ; and her mother , who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent , was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home . On their return from the park they found Willoughby 's curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage , and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just .
Lady Middleton	""" At any rate , "" said Elinor , wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister 's thoughts as clearly as she did , "" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week ."
Lady Middleton	Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan , and excepting a few old city friends , whom , to Lady Middleton 's regret , she had never dropped , she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions . Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected , Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties , which , whether at home or abroad , formed only for cards , could have little to amuse her .
Lady Middleton	It was from Lady Middleton , announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before , and requesting the company of her mother and cousins the following evening . Business on Sir John 's part , and a violent cold on her own , prevented their calling in Berkeley Street .
Lady Middleton	Elinor found , when the evening was over , that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode , for although scarcely settled in town , Sir John had contrived to collect around him , nearly twenty young people , and to amuse them with a ball . This was an affair , however , of which Lady Middleton did not approve .
Lady Middleton	In the country , an unpremeditated dance was very allowable ; but in London , where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained , it was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls , to have it known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple , with two violins , and a mere side - board collation . Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party ; from the former , whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town , as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother - in - law , and therefore never came near her , they received no mark of recognition on their entrance .
Lucy Steele	Lucy is monstrous pretty , and so good humoured and agreeable ! The children are all hanging about her already , as if she was an old acquaintance .
Lucy Steele	""" "" What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is ! "" said Lucy Steele ."
Lucy Steele	""" I have a notion , "" said Lucy , "" you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton ; and for my part , I love to see children full of life and spirits ; I can not bear them if they are tame and quiet . """
Lucy Steele	""" We have heard Sir John admire it excessively , "" said Lucy , who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister ."
Lucy Steele	""" "" But why should you think , "" said Lucy , looking ashamed of her sister , "" that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex ? "" "" Nay , my dear , I 'm sure I do n't pretend to say that there an't ."
Lucy Steele	""" How can you say so , Anne ? "" cried Lucy , who generally made an amendment to all her sister 's assertions . """
Lucy Steele	23 However small Elinor 's general dependence on Lucy 's veracity might be , it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case , where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description .
Lucy Steele	What Lucy had asserted to be true , therefore , Elinor could not , dared not longer doubt ; supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs , and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes .
Lucy Steele	Their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest , at once indisputable and alarming ; and Edward 's visit near Plymouth , his melancholy state of mind , his dissatisfaction at his own prospects , his uncertain behaviour towards herself , the intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections , which had often surprised her , the picture , the letter , the ring , formed altogether such a body of evidence , as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly , and established as a fact , which no partiality could set aside , his ill - treatment of herself.--Her
Lucy Steele	resentment of such behaviour , her indignation at having been its dupe , for a short time made her feel only for herself ; but other ideas , other considerations , soon arose . Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her ? Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel ?
Lucy Steele	Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart ?
Lucy Steele	No ; whatever it might once have been , she could not believe it such at present .
Lucy Steele	His affection was all her own .
Lucy Steele	She could not be deceived in that .
Lucy Steele	Her mother , sisters , Fanny , all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland ; it was not an illusion of her own vanity .
Lucy Steele	He certainly loved her .
Lucy Steele	How much could it not tempt her to forgive !
Lucy Steele	He had been blamable , highly blamable , in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be .
Lucy Steele	In that , he could not be defended ; but if he had injured her , how much more had he injured himself ; if her case were pitiable , his was hopeless .
Lucy Steele	His imprudence had made her miserable for a while ; but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise . She might in time regain tranquillity ; but HE , what had he to look forward to ?
Lucy Steele	Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele ; could he , were his affection for herself out of the question , with his integrity , his delicacy , and well - informed mind , be satisfied with a wife like her -- illiterate , artful , and selfish ? The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature ; but the four succeeding years -- years , which if rationally spent , give such improvement to the understanding , must have opened his eyes to her defects of education , while the same period of time , spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits , had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty .
Lucy Steele	If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself , his difficulties from his mother had seemed great , how much greater were they now likely to be , when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections , and probably inferior in fortune to herself . These difficulties , indeed , with a heart so alienated from Lucy , might not press very hard upon his patience ; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness , could be felt as a relief ! As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession , she wept for him , more than for herself .
Lucy Steele	Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness , and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem , she thought she could even now , under the first smart of the heavy blow , command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters .
Lucy Steele	And so well was she able to answer her own expectations , that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes , no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters , that Elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love , and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man , of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed , and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house .
Lucy Steele	The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne , what had been entrusted in confidence to herself , though it obliged her to unceasing exertion , was no aggravation of Elinor 's distress . On the contrary it was a relief to her , to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them , and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward , which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself , and which was more than she felt equal to support . From their counsel , or their conversation , she knew she could receive no assistance , their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress , while her self - command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise . She was stronger alone , and her own good sense so well supported her , that her firmness was as unshaken , her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable , as with regrets so poignant and so fresh , it was possible for them to be .
Lucy Steele	Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject
Lucy Steele	, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it ; and this for more reasons than one .
Lucy Steele	She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again , she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward , whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him , and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy , by her readiness to enter on the matter again , and her calmness in conversing on it , that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend , which she very much feared her involuntary agitation , in their morning discourse , must have left at least doubtful . That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable : it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise , not merely from Lucy 's assertion , but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance , with a secret so confessedly and evidently important . And even Sir John 's joking intelligence must have had some weight . But indeed , while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward , it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous ; and
Lucy Steele	that she was so , her very confidence was a proof .
Lucy Steele	What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be , but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy 's superior claims on Edward , and be taught to avoid him in future ?
Lucy Steele	She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival 's intentions , and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed , to combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible ; she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was unwounded .
Lucy Steele	And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told , she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure .
Lucy Steele	But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be commanded , though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred ; for the weather was not often fine enough to allow of their joining in a walk , where they might most easily separate themselves from the others ; and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or cottage , and chiefly at the former , they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation .
Lucy Steele	One or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private , when Sir John called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles . Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother 's permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise .
Lucy Steele	The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected ; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression , and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room : to the latter , the children accompanied them , and while they remained there , she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy 's attention to attempt it . They quitted it only with the removal of the tea - things .
Lucy Steele	The card - table was then placed , and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park .
Lucy Steele	""" I am glad , "" said Lady Middleton to Lucy , "" you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria 's basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight ."
Lucy Steele	"This hint was enough , Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied , "" Indeed you are very much mistaken , Lady Middleton ; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me , or I should have been at my filigree already ."
Lucy Steele	I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card - table now , I am resolved to finish the basket after supper .
Lucy Steele	""" You are very good , I hope it wo n't hurt your eyes-- will you ring the bell for some working candles ?"
Lucy Steele	Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child .
Lucy Steele	"No one made any objection but Marianne , who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility , exclaimed , "" Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME -- you know I detest cards ."
Lucy Steele	""" Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma'am , "" said Elinor , endeavouring to smooth away the offence ; "" and I do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano - forte I ever heard . """
Lucy Steele	""" Perhaps , "" continued Elinor , "" if I should happen to cut out , I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele , in rolling her papers for her ; and there is so much still to be done to the basket , that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly , to finish it this evening ."
Lucy Steele	"I should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it . "" "" Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help , "" cried Lucy , "" for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was ; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all . "" "" Oh !"
Lucy Steele	"that would be terrible , indeed , "" said Miss Steele-- "" Dear little soul , how I do love her ! """
Lucy Steele	Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals , and thus by a little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to practise , gained her own end , and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time .
Lucy Steele	Lucy made room for her with ready attention , and the two fair rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table , and , with the utmost harmony , engaged in forwarding the same work .
Lucy Steele	The pianoforte at which Marianne , wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts , had by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself , was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely , under the shelter of its noise , introduce the interesting subject , without any risk of being heard at the card - table .
Lucy Steele	It does not do him justice , to be sure , but yet I think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for.--I
Lucy Steele	have had it above these three years .
Lucy Steele	She put it into her hands as she spoke ; and when Elinor saw the painting , whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision , or her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind , she could have none of its being Edward 's face .
Lucy Steele	She returned it almost instantly , acknowledging the likeness .
Lucy Steele	""" I have never been able , "" continued Lucy , "" to give him my picture in return , which I am very much vexed at , for he has been always so anxious to get it !"
Lucy Steele	But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity .
Lucy Steele	""" "" You are quite in the right , "" replied Elinor calmly ."
Lucy Steele	Lucy spoke first .
Lucy Steele	""" I am sure , "" said she , "" I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say ."
Lucy Steele	I shall have no fortune , and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman .
Lucy Steele	""" I certainly did not seek your confidence , "" said Elinor ; "" but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on ."
Lucy Steele	Your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication .
Lucy Steele	"You must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety . "" As she said this , she looked earnestly at Lucy , hoping to discover something in her countenance ; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying ; but Lucy 's countenance suffered no change ."
Lucy Steele	""" I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you , "" said she , "" in telling you all this ."
Lucy Steele	I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance .
Lucy Steele	Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward 's mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask .
Lucy Steele	Anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for I am in constant fear of her betraying me .
Lucy Steele	She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day , when Edward 's name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all .
Lucy Steele	""" Here she took out her handkerchief ; but Elinor did not feel very compassionate ."
Lucy Steele	""" Sometimes . "" continued Lucy , after wiping her eyes , "" I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely . """
Lucy Steele	As she said this , she looked directly at her companion .
Lucy Steele	""" But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it.-- I can not bear the thoughts of making him so miserable , as I know the very mention of such a thing would do ."
Lucy Steele	And on my own account too -- so dear as he is to me -- I do n't think I could be equal to it .
Lucy Steele	What would you advise me to do in such a case , Miss Dashwood ?
Lucy Steele	What would you do yourself ?
Lucy Steele	""" "" Pardon me , "" replied Elinor , startled by the question ; "" but I can give you no advice under such circumstances ."
Lucy Steele	Your own judgment must direct you .
Lucy Steele	""" To be sure , "" continued Lucy , after a few minutes silence on both sides , "" his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor Edward is so cast down by it !"
Lucy Steele	"He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple , to go to you , that I was afraid you would think him quite ill . "" "" Did he come from your uncle 's , then , when he visited us ?"
Lucy Steele	""" Oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us . Did you think he came directly from town ?"
Lucy Steele	""" No , "" replied Elinor , most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy 's veracity ; "" I remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth . "" She remembered too , her own surprise at the time , at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends , at his total silence with respect even to their names ."
Lucy Steele	""" Did not you think him sadly out of spirits ? "" repeated Lucy ."
Lucy Steele	""" I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter ; but it made him so melancholy , not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us , and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now ; for he writes in wretched spirits ."
Lucy Steele	"I heard from him just before I left Exeter ; "" taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor ."
Lucy Steele	""" You know his hand , I dare say , a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual.--He"
Lucy Steele	was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full
Lucy Steele	Elinor saw that it WAS his hand , and she could doubt no longer .
Lucy Steele	This picture , she had allowed herself to believe , might have been accidentally obtained ; it might not have been Edward 's gift ; but a correspondence between them by letter , could subsist only under a positive engagement , could be authorised by nothing else ; for a few moments , she was almost overcome -- her heart sunk within her , and she could hardly stand ; but exertion was indispensably necessary ; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings , that her success was speedy , and for
Lucy Steele	""" Writing to each other , "" said Lucy , returning the letter into her pocket , "" is the only comfort we have in such long separations ."
Lucy Steele	Yes , I have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even THAT .
Lucy Steele	If he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture .
Lucy Steele	""" "" I did , "" said Elinor , with a composure of voice , under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before ."
Lucy Steele	She was mortified , shocked , confounded .
Lucy Steele	Fortunately for her , they had now reached the cottage , and the conversation could be continued no farther . After sitting with them a few minutes , the Miss Steeles returned to the Park , and Elinor was then at liberty to think and be wretched . [ At this point in the first and second editions , Volume 1 ends .
Lucy Steele	41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett 's Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life .
Lucy Steele	I have good reason to think -- indeed I have it from the best authority , or I should not repeat it , for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it -- but I have it from the very best authority -- not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself -- but her daughter DID , and I have it from her -- That in short , whatever objections there might be against a certain -- a certain connection -- you understand me -- it would have been far preferable to her , it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does .
Lucy Steele	""" When I see him again , "" said Elinor to herself , as the door shut him out , "" I shall see him the husband of Lucy . """
Lucy Steele	It seems quite ridiculous . But , my dear , we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before Lucy goes to it .
Lucy Steele	"I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there . "" Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more ."
Lucy Steele	On ascending the stairs , the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before them in the room , that there was not a person at liberty to tend to their orders ; and they were obliged to wait .
Lucy Steele	The ivory , the gold , and the pearls , all received their appointment , and the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick - case , drew on his gloves with leisurely care , and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods , but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration , walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference . Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward , was on the point of concluding it , when another gentleman presented himself at her side . She turned her eyes towards his face , and found him with some surprise to be her brother .
Lucy Steele	Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray 's shop .
Lucy Steele	""" I wished very much to call upon you yesterday , "" said he , "" but it was impossible , for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars ."
Lucy Steele	THIS morning I had fully intended to call on you , if I could possibly find a spare half hour ,
Lucy Steele	But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street , and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings .
Lucy Steele	And the Middletons too , you must introduce me to THEM .
Lucy Steele	"As my mother - in - law 's relations , I shall be happy to show them every respect . They are excellent neighbours to you in the country , I understand . "" "" Excellent indeed ."
Lucy Steele	But so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected .
Lucy Steele	And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing !
Lucy Steele	"It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , I assure you . """
Lucy Steele	"Recollecting himself , however , he added , "" That is , I mean to say -- your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; Fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , I assure you ."
Lucy Steele	"You may guess , after all these expenses , how very far we must be from being rich , and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars 's kindness is . "" "" Certainly , "" said Elinor ; "" and assisted by her liberality , I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances ."
Lucy Steele	""" And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ? "" "" Her daughters are both exceedingly well married , and therefore I can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther . Whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard ."
Lucy Steele	Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with .
Lucy Steele	Or at least , if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward 's being fettered to Lucy , she determined , that had Lucy been more amiable , she OUGHT to have rejoiced .
Lucy Steele	She wondered that Lucy 's spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was NOT ELINOR , appear a compliment to herself -- or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her , because her real situation was unknown .
Lucy Steele	But that it was so , had not only been declared by Lucy 's eyes at the time , but was declared over again the next morning more openly , for at her particular desire , Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone , to tell her how happy she was .
Lucy Steele	""" My dear friend , "" cried Lucy , as soon as they were by themselves , "" I come to talk to you of my happiness ."
Lucy Steele	Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars 's way of treating me yesterday ?
Lucy Steele	So exceeding affable as she was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;-- but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me .
Lucy Steele	Now was not it so?-- You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ?
Lucy Steele	""" She was certainly very civil to you . "" "" Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast deal more ."
Lucy Steele	"Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride , no hauteur , and your sister just the same -- all sweetness and affability ! """
Lucy Steele	"Elinor wished to talk of something else , but Lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness ; and Elinor was obliged to go on.-- "" Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement , "" said she , "" nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was not the case""-- "" I guessed you would say so""--replied Lucy quickly--""but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing ."
Lucy Steele	You sha n't talk me out of my satisfaction .
Lucy Steele	I am sure it will all end well , and there will be no difficulties at all , to what I used to think .
Lucy Steele	Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister .
Lucy Steele	"They are both delightful women , indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was ! "" To this Elinor had no answer to make , and did not attempt any ."
Lucy Steele	""" I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it ."
Lucy Steele	"I should be sorry to have YOU ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship . ""-- Elinor tried to make a civil answer , though doubting her own success ."
Lucy Steele	"But it seemed to satisfy Lucy , for she directly replied , "" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward 's love , it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton 's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;-- and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me.--"
Lucy Steele	They are such charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her , you can not speak too high .
Lucy Steele	But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she SHOULD tell her sister .
Lucy Steele	"Lucy continued . """
Lucy Steele	I am sure I should have seen it in a moment , if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me .
Lucy Steele	If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way -- you know what I mean -- if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair .
Lucy Steele	I could not have stood it .
Lucy Steele	"For where she DOES dislike , I know it is most violent . "" Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph , by the door 's being thrown open , the servant 's announcing Mr. Ferrars , and Edward 's immediately walking in . It was a very awkward moment ; and the countenance of each shewed that it was so . They all looked exceedingly foolish ; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again , as to advance farther into it ."
Lucy Steele	The ladies recovered themselves first . It was not Lucy 's business to put herself forward , and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up .
Lucy Steele	She could therefore only LOOK her tenderness , and after slightly addressing him , said no more .
Lucy Steele	She would not allow the presence of Lucy , nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself , to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him , and that she had very much regretted being from home , when he called before in Berkeley Street . She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which , as a friend and almost a relation , were his due , by the observant eyes of Lucy , though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her .
Lucy Steele	Her manners gave some re - assurance to Edward , and he had courage enough to sit down ; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion , which the case rendered reasonable , though his sex might make it rare ; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy 's , nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor 's
Lucy Steele	Lucy , with a demure and settled air , seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others , and would not say a word ; and almost every thing that WAS said , proceeded from Elinor , who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother 's health , their coming to town , & c. which Edward ought to have inquired about , but never did .
Lucy Steele	Again they all sat down , and for a moment or two all were silent ; while Marianne was looking with the most speaking tenderness , sometimes at Edward and sometimes at Elinor , regretting only that their delight in each other should be checked by Lucy 's unwelcome presence .
Lucy Steele	"That must be enough for us both . "" This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy , nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy , who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression ."
Lucy Steele	""" Perhaps , Miss Marianne , "" cried Lucy , eager to take some revenge on her , "" you think young men never stand upon engagements , if they have no mind to keep them , little as well as great ."
Lucy Steele	And drawing him a little aside , she whispered her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer .
Lucy Steele	But even this encouragement failed , for he would go ; and Lucy , who would have outstaid him , had his visit lasted two hours , soon afterwards went away .
Lucy Steele	""" What can bring her here so often ? "" said Marianne , on her leaving them ."
Lucy Steele	""" Could not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teazing to Edward ! """
Lucy Steele	""" Why so?--we were all his friends , and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any ."
Lucy Steele	"It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves . """
Lucy Steele	She then left the room ; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more , for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy , she could give no information that would convince Marianne ;
Lucy Steele	Miss Dashwood !
Lucy Steele	have you heard the news ?
Lucy Steele	But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr. Palmer 's , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child .
Lucy Steele	She was sure it was very ill -- it cried , and fretted , and was all over pimples . So I looked at it directly , and , ' Lord ! my dear , ' says I , ' it is nothing in the world , but the red gum--
Lucy Steele	So upon that , he smirked , and simpered , and looked grave , and seemed to know something or other , and at last he said in a whisper , ' For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister 's indisposition , I think it advisable to say , that I believe there is no great reason for alarm ; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will do very well . '
Lucy Steele	""" That is exactly what I said , my dear ."
Lucy Steele	Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ) , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There 's for you , my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it
Lucy Steele	' Lord ! ' thinks she to herself , ' they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ; ' and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet - work , little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord 's daughter or other , I forget who . So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride .
Lucy Steele	She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother 's ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing - room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . So up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for Lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on .
Lucy Steele	And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit .
Lucy Steele	Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes .
Lucy Steele	THEN she fell into hysterics again , and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan , and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar .
Lucy Steele	The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad .
Lucy Steele	I declare , I have no patience with your sister ; and I hope , with all my heart , it will be a match in spite of her .
Lucy Steele	He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care .
Lucy Steele	There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a - year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . Lord !
Lucy Steele	She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was ; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last , than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy .
Lucy Steele	For HIM she felt much compassion;-- for Lucy very little -- and it cost her some pains to procure that little;--for the rest of the party none at all .
Lucy Steele	No time was to be lost in undeceiving her , in making her acquainted with the real truth , and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others , without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister , or any resentment against Edward . Elinor 's office was a painful one.--She
Lucy Steele	going to remove what she really believed to be her sister 's chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and to make Marianne , by a resemblance in their situations , which to HER fancy would seem strong , feel all her own disappointment over again . But unwelcome as such a task must be , it was necessary to be done , and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it .
Lucy Steele	As for Lucy Steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her . She would not even admit it to have been natural ; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so , by that which only could convince her , a better knowledge of mankind . Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed.--Marianne 's feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment .
Lucy Steele	""" "" I have known it these four months . When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November , she told me in confidence of her engagement . """
Lucy Steele	""" By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to Lucy , obliged me to be secret ."
Lucy Steele	I owed it to her , therefore , to avoid giving any hint of the truth ; and I owed it to my family and friends , not to create in them a solicitude about me , which it could not be in my power to satisfy .
Lucy Steele	"Lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--And after all , Marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one 's happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant -- it is not fit -- it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edward will marry Lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER.""-- "" If such is your way of thinking , "" said Marianne , "" if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else , your resolution , your self - command , are , perhaps , a little less to be wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension ."
Lucy Steele	""" I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For four months , Marianne , I have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as I thought , with triumph.-- This person 's suspicions , therefore , I have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling -- surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW ."
Lucy Steele	In such a frame of mind as she was now in , Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality.-- These were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make . She performed her promise of being discreet , to admiration.--She
Lucy Steele	"""--She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another , and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward 's affection , it cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such"
Lucy Steele	advances towards heroism in her sister , made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself .
Lucy Steele	"Your sister , "" he continued , "" has suffered dreadfully ."
Lucy Steele	"I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . """
Lucy Steele	Miss Lucy Steele is , I dare say , a very deserving young woman , but in the present case you know , the connection must be impossible .
Lucy Steele	And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle 's care , the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars , is perhaps , altogether a little extraordinary .
Lucy Steele	when to that is added the recollection , that he might , but for his own folly , within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand , five hundred a - year ( for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds , ) I can not picture to myself a more wretched condition .
Lucy Steele	The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad .
Lucy Steele	Elinor , without observing the varying complexion of her sister , and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan , immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both , in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations .
Lucy Steele	Do n't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I sha n't put myself at all out of my way for you . It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford THAT . We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters .
Lucy Steele	I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I do n't get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault .
Lucy Steele	"I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . "" "" I have a notion , "" said Sir John , "" that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it ."
Lucy Steele	It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because Miss Dashwood does not wish it .
Lucy Steele	So I would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of Barton , without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it .
Lucy Steele	""" "" Nay , "" cried Mrs. Jennings , "" I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne 's company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back ."
Lucy Steele	Lord bless me !
Lucy Steele	how do you think I can live poking by myself , I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me .
Lucy Steele	Come , Miss Marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better .
Lucy Steele	""" "" I thank you , ma'am , sincerely thank you , "" said Marianne , with warmth : "" your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it ."
Lucy Steele	But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother,--I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence -- Oh !
Lucy Steele	no , nothing should tempt me to leave her .
Lucy Steele	"It should not , must not be a struggle . "" Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare them perfectly well ; and Elinor , who now understood her sister , and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again , made no farther direct opposition to the plan , and merely referred it to her mother 's decision , from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit , which she could not approve of for Marianne , and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid . Whatever Marianne was desirous of , her mother would be eager to promote -- she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust ; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London . That Marianne , fastidious as she was , thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings ' manners , and invariably disgusted by them , should overlook every inconvenience of that kind , should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings , in her pursuit of one object , was such a proof , so strong , so full , of the importance of that object to her , as Elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness ."
Lucy Steele	On being informed of the invitation , Mrs. Dashwood , persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters , and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself , how much the heart of Marianne was in it , would not hear of their declining the offer upon HER account ; insisted on their both accepting it directly ; and then began to foresee , with her usual cheerfulness , a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all , from this separation .
Lucy Steele	Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves .
Lucy Steele	When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music !
Lucy Steele	You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again !
Lucy Steele	I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one .
Lucy Steele	It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London .
Lucy Steele	You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt .
Lucy Steele	"And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . "" "" Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , "" said Elinor , "" you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . "" Marianne 's countenance sunk . "" And what , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , "" is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ?"
Lucy Steele	What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward ?
Lucy Steele	""" That is very true , "" replied her mother , "" but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton ."
Lucy Steele	""" If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings , "" said Marianne , "" at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation ."
Lucy Steele	"I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . "" Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours . To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy 's account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished . "" I will have you BOTH go , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ; "" these objections are nonsensical ."
Lucy Steele	"You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law 's family . "" Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother 's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself , that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed , and now on this attack , though almost hopeless of success , she forced herself to begin her design by saying , as calmly as she could , "" I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . """
Lucy Steele	Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment , and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue .
Lucy Steele	Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being delighted , which was putting herself rather out of her way ; and as for the Miss Steeles , especially Lucy , they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them .
Lucy Steele	when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan , and her sister exhilarated by it in look , voice , and manner , restored to all her usual animation , and elevated to more than her usual gaiety , she could not be dissatisfied with the cause , and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence .
Lucy Steele	Marianne 's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness , so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone .
Lucy Steele	Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness ; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive .
Lucy Steele	Her mother 's affliction was hardly less , and Elinor was the only one of the three , who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal .
Lucy Steele	""" No , "" answered Elinor , with a smile , which concealed very agitated feelings , "" on such a subject I certainly will not ."
Lucy Steele	"You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes . "" "" Indeed you wrong me , "" replied Lucy , with great solemnity ; "" I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ' I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , ' I should resolve upon doing it immediately . """
Lucy Steele	"Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward 's future wife , and replied , "" This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one ."
Lucy Steele	"It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person . "" "" ' Tis because you are an indifferent person , "" said Lucy , with some pique , and laying a particular stress on those words , "" that your judgment might justly have such weight with me . If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having . "" Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this , lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve ; and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again . Another pause therefore of many minutes ' duration , succeeded this speech , and Lucy was still the first to end it ."
Lucy Steele	""" Shall you be in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? "" said she with all her accustomary complacency ."
Lucy Steele	""" I am sorry for that , "" returned the other , while her eyes brightened at the information , "" it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there !"
Lucy Steele	But I dare say you will go for all that .
Lucy Steele	To be sure , your brother and sister will ask you to come to them .
Lucy Steele	""" It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do . "" "" How unlucky that is !"
Lucy Steele	I had quite depended upon meeting you there .
Lucy Steele	Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years !
Lucy Steele	"But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward . He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it . """
Lucy Steele	Elinor was soon called to the card - table by the conclusion of the first rubber , and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end , to which both of them submitted without any reluctance , for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before ; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife ; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage , which sincere affection on HER side would have given , for self - interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement , of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary . From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor , and when entered on by Lucy , who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it , and was particularly careful to inform her confidante , of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward , it was treated by the former with calmness and caution , and dismissed as soon as civility would allow ; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which Lucy did not deserve , and which were dangerous to herself .
Lucy Steele	He was brought , not from doubt or suspense , but from misery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine , flowing , grateful cheerfulness , as his friends had never witnessed in him before . His heart was now open to Elinor , all its weaknesses , all its errors confessed , and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty - four .
Lucy Steele	nay , I am sure , it would never have happened ; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought , at the time , a most unconquerable preference for his niece , yet had I then had any pursuit , any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months , I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment , especially by mixing more with the world , as in such case I must have done
Lucy Steele	But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen . I had therefore nothing in the world to do , but to fancy myself in love ; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable , as I had no friend , no companion in my brother , and disliked new acquaintance , it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple , where I always felt myself at home , and was always sure of a welcome ; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen : Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging . She was pretty too -- at least I thought so THEN ; and I had seen so little of other women , that I could make no comparisons , and see no defects .
Lucy Steele	Comparisons would occur -- regrets would arise;--and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language . But Elinor -- how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil .
Lucy Steele	Lucy 's marriage , the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all , formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and Elinor 's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view , as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard .
Lucy Steele	""" THAT was exactly like Robert,""--was his immediate observation.--""And THAT , "" he presently added , "" might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began . And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour ."
Lucy Steele	Not the smallest suspicion , therefore , had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself , he had been for some time , he believed , half stupified between the wonder , the horror , and the joy of such a deliverance .
Lucy Steele	She will hardly be less hurt , I suppose , by Robert 's marrying Lucy , than she would have been by your marrying her .
Lucy Steele	""" In what state the affair stood at present between them , Edward knew not , for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him . He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy 's letter arrived , and with only one object before him , the nearest road to Barton , had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct , with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection ."
Lucy Steele	He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . It was his business , however , to say that he DID , and he said it very prettily . What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives . That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive , to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas , was perfectly clear to Elinor ; and Edward himself , now thoroughly enlightened on her character , had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill - nature . Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions-- they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well - disposed , good - hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself .
Lucy Steele	"Edward was , of course , immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than Lucy 's conduct , nor more self - evident than the motive of it . Elinor scolded him , harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves , for having spent so much time with them at Norland , when he must have felt his own inconstancy . "" Your behaviour was certainly very wrong , "" said she ; "" because -- to say nothing of my own conviction , our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT , as you were THEN situated , could never be . """
Lucy Steele	I felt that I admired you , but I told myself it was only friendship ; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and Lucy , I did not know how far I was got .
Lucy Steele	No rumour of Lucy 's marriage had yet reached him:--he knew nothing of what had passed ; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering .
Lucy Steele	Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood , and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars , since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor . It would be needless to say , that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other , as they advanced in each other 's acquaintance , for it could not be otherwise . Their resemblance in good principles and good sense , in disposition and manner of thinking , would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship , without any other attraction ; but their being in love with two sisters , and two sisters fond of each other , made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate , which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment .
Lucy Steele	"Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken - hearted , at Oxford.-- "" I do think , "" she continued , "" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again ."
Lucy Steele	And I must say that Lucy 's crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all .
Lucy Steele	Robert 's offence was unpardonable , but Lucy 's was infinitely worse .
Lucy Steele	The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them , was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime , because , had any suspicion of it occurred to the others , proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage ; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy 's engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled , than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.--
Lucy Steele	Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars 's heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children .
Lucy Steele	It determined him to attempt a reconciliation , though not exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister .
Mrs. Dashwood	17 Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him ; for his coming to Barton was , in her opinion , of all things the most natural .
Mrs. Dashwood	Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder .
Mrs. Dashwood	He received the kindest welcome from her ; and shyness , coldness , reserve could not stand against such a reception .
Mrs. Dashwood	They had begun to fail him before he entered the house , and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood .
Mrs. Dashwood	Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters , without extending the passion to her ; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself .
Mrs. Dashwood	"The whole family perceived it , and Mrs. Dashwood , attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother , sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents . "" What are Mrs. Ferrars 's views for you at present , Edward ? "" said she , when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire ; "" are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	"I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life ! """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" You have no ambition , I well know ."
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , "" if my children were all to be rich my help . """
Mrs. Dashwood	You , Miss Dashwood , would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you -- and as for Marianne , I know her greatness of soul , there would not be music enough in London to content her .
Mrs. Dashwood	""" No , Edward , I should have something else to do with it . "" "" Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life -- your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ? "" "" Undoubtedly ."
Mrs. Dashwood	In the society of his nephew and niece , and their children , the old Gentleman 's days were comfortably spent .
Mrs. Dashwood	The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes , which proceeded not merely from interest , but from goodness of heart , gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive ; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence .
Mrs. Dashwood	The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child , who , in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland , had so far gained on the affections of his uncle , by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old ; an imperfect articulation , an earnest desire of having his own way , many cunning tricks , and a great deal of noise , as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which , for years , he had received from his niece and her daughters . He meant not to
Mrs. Dashwood	But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;-- more narrow - minded and selfish .
Mrs. Dashwood	No sooner was his father 's funeral over , than Mrs. John Dashwood , without sending any notice of her intention to her mother - in - law , arrived with her child and their attendants .
Mrs. Dashwood	No one could dispute her right to come ; the house was her husband 's from the moment of his father 's decease ; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater , and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood 's situation , with only common feelings , must have been highly unpleasing;-- but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen , a generosity so romantic , that any offence of the kind , by whomsoever given or received , was to her a source of immoveable disgust .
Mrs. Dashwood	Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband 's family ; but she had had no opportunity , till the present , of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it .
Mrs. Dashwood	So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour , and so earnestly did she despise her daughter - in - law for it , that , on the arrival of the latter , she would have quitted the house for ever , had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going , and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay , and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother
Mrs. Dashwood	Elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence .
Mrs. Dashwood	Elinor saw , with concern , the excess of her sister 's sensibility ; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished .
Mrs. Dashwood	"I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . "" "" I have a notion , "" said Sir John , "" that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it ."
Mrs. Dashwood	""" "" Nay , "" cried Mrs. Jennings , "" I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne 's company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back ."
Mrs. Dashwood	On being informed of the invitation , Mrs. Dashwood , persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters , and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself , how much the heart of Marianne was in it , would not hear of their declining the offer upon HER account ; insisted on their both accepting it directly ; and then began to foresee , with her usual cheerfulness , a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all , from this separation .
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I am delighted with the plan , "" she cried , "" it is exactly what I could wish ."
Mrs. Dashwood	Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves .
Mrs. Dashwood	I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one .
Mrs. Dashwood	It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London .
Mrs. Dashwood	You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt .
Mrs. Dashwood	"And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . "" "" Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , "" said Elinor , "" you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . "" Marianne 's countenance sunk . "" And what , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , "" is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ?"
Mrs. Dashwood	"Do let me hear a word about the expense of it . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings 's heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence ."
Mrs. Dashwood	"I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . "" Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours . To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy 's account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished . "" I will have you BOTH go , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ; "" these objections are nonsensical ."
Mrs. Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood smiled , and said nothing .
Mrs. Dashwood	He was proud of his conquest , proud of tricking Edward , and very proud of marrying privately without his mother 's consent . What immediately followed is known .
Mrs. Dashwood	The forgiveness , at first , indeed , as was reasonable , comprehended only Robert ; and Lucy , who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none , still remained some weeks longer unpardoned .
Mrs. Dashwood	Elinor 's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived , without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless , for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her .
Mrs. Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford ; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest , though rather more liberal than what John had expressed .
Mrs. Dashwood	It was now her darling object .
Mrs. Dashwood	Precious as was the company of her daughter to her , she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend ; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion - house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor . They each felt his sorrows , and their own obligations , and Marianne , by general consent , was to be the reward of all . With such a confederacy against her -- with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness -- with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself , which at last , though long after it was observable to everybody else -- burst on her -- what could she do ?
Mrs. Dashwood	Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion , as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,--instead of remaining even for ever with her mother , and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study , as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,-- she found herself at nineteen , submitting to new attachments , entering on new duties , placed in a new home , a wife , the mistress of a family , and the patroness of a village .
Mrs. Dashwood	15 Mrs. Dashwood 's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day , and two of her daughters went with her ; but Marianne excused herself from being of the party , under some trifling pretext of employment ; and her mother , who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent , was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home . On their return from the park they found Willoughby 's curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage , and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just .
Mrs. Dashwood	So far it was all as she had foreseen ; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect .
Mrs. Dashwood	"Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted , where they found only Willoughby , who was leaning against the mantel - piece with his back towards them . He turned round on their coming in , and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over - powered Marianne . "" Is anything the matter with her ? "" cried Mrs. Dashwood as she entered--""is she ill ? "" "" I hope not , "" he replied , trying to look cheerful ; and with a forced smile presently added , "" It is I who may rather expect to be ill -- for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment ! """
Mrs. Dashwood	"But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from us long I hope . "" He coloured as he replied , "" You are very kind , but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately ."
Mrs. Dashwood	"For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ? "" His colour increased ; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied , "" You are too good . """
Mrs. Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise .
Mrs. Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood first spoke .
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I have only to add , my dear Willoughby , that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for I will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith ; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination . """
Mrs. Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak , and another pause succeeded .
Mrs. Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech , and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned .
Mrs. Dashwood	Elinor 's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother 's .
Mrs. Dashwood	Willoughby 's behaviour in taking leave of them , his embarrassment , and affectation of cheerfulness , and , above all , his unwillingness to accept her mother 's invitation , a backwardness so unlike a lover , so unlike himself , greatly disturbed her .
Mrs. Dashwood	One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side ; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for , though when she considered what Marianne 's love for him was , a quarrel seemed almost impossible . But whatever might be the particulars of their separation , her sister 's affliction was indubitable ; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief , but feeding and encouraging as a duty . In about half an hour her mother returned , and though her eyes were red , her countenance was not uncheerful .
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton , Elinor , "" said she , as she sat down to work , "" and with how heavy a heart does he travel ?"
Mrs. Dashwood	YOU must have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be ? Can they have quarrelled ?
Mrs. Dashwood	"Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?""-- "" It was not inclination that he wanted , Elinor ; I could plainly see THAT ."
Mrs. Dashwood	I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you .
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Can you , indeed ! "" "" Yes ."
Mrs. Dashwood	I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--but you , Elinor , who love to doubt where you can -- it will not satisfy YOU , I know ; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it .
Mrs. Dashwood	I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him , ) and on that account is eager to get him away;-- and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him . This is what I believe to have happened . He is , moreover , aware that she DOES disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from Devonshire for a while . You will tell me , I know , that this may or may NOT have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this .
Mrs. Dashwood	"And now , Elinor , what have you to say ? "" "" Nothing , for you have anticipated my answer . "" "" Then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened ."
Mrs. Dashwood	There is great truth , however , in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him , and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body . Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct , and I will hope that he has .
Mrs. Dashwood	"Secrecy may be advisable ; but still I can not help wondering at its being practiced by him . "" "" Do not blame him , however , for departing from his character , where the deviation is necessary ."
Mrs. Dashwood	"But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence?--I am happy -- and he is acquitted . """
Mrs. Dashwood	my dear child , do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment ?
Mrs. Dashwood	""" "" I am perfectly satisfied of both . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject , by either of them . "" "" I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly ."
Mrs. Dashwood	Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks , his manner , his attentive and affectionate respect ?
Mrs. Dashwood	My Elinor , is it possible to doubt their engagement ?
Mrs. Dashwood	""" "" No , I can not think that . He must and does love her I am sure ."
Mrs. Dashwood	""" "" But with a strange kind of tenderness , if he can leave her with such indifference , such carelessness of the future , as you attribute to him . "" "" You must remember , my dear mother , that I have never considered this matter as certain ."
Mrs. Dashwood	Ungracious girl ! But I require no such proof .
Mrs. Dashwood	Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt ; no secrecy has been attempted ; all has been uniformly open and unreserved
Mrs. Dashwood	Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately , it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once : but this is not the case .
Mrs. Dashwood	They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret ; and Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations of her mother , to acknowledge the probability of many , and hope for the justice of all .
Mrs. Dashwood	Her eyes were red and swollen ; and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty . She avoided the looks of them all , could neither eat nor speak , and after some time , on her mother 's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion , her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome , she burst into tears and left the room .
Fanny Dashwood	Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you .
Fanny Dashwood	"You may see her if you look this way . "" As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes , without taking that liberty , she begged to be excused ."
Fanny Dashwood	"I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all ! """
Fanny Dashwood	"Mrs. Palmer laughed , and said it would not do her any harm . "" She expects to be confined in February , "" continued Mrs. Jennings . Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation , and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in the paper . "" No , none at all , "" he replied , and read on ."
Fanny Dashwood	He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor , told her that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street , and , assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her , invited her to come in .
Fanny Dashwood	""" Fanny is in her own room , I suppose , "" said he:--""I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it , indeed ."
Fanny Dashwood	will not mention the matter to Fanny , however , for though I have broke it to her , and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear it much talked of .
Fanny Dashwood	Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing , that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure , an acquisition of wealth to her brother , by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished .
Fanny Dashwood	After a few moments ' chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister 's being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother 's love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother 's integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart .
Fanny Dashwood	Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days .
Fanny Dashwood	but one has always so much to do on first coming to town . I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal .
Fanny Dashwood	"Recollecting himself , however , he added , "" That is , I mean to say -- your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; Fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , I assure you ."
Fanny Dashwood	"And her mother too , Mrs. Ferrars , a very good - natured woman , I am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day . "" Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer . "" It would be something remarkable , now , "" he continued , "" something droll , if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time . And yet it is not very unlikely . "" "" Is Mr. Edward Ferrars , "" said Elinor , with resolution , "" going to be married ? "" """
Fanny Dashwood	To give you another instance of her liberality:--The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny 's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds .
Fanny Dashwood	There is not a stone laid of Fanny 's green - house , and nothing but the plan of the flower - garden marked out .
Fanny Dashwood	I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her .
Fanny Dashwood	She will be mistaken , however .
Fanny Dashwood	"I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . "" Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon ; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished , and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman , and promoting the marriage by every possible attention . He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself , to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal ; and an offer from Colonel Brandon , or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings , was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect ."
Fanny Dashwood	""" I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny , "" said he , as he walked back with his sister ."
Fanny Dashwood	Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know .
Fanny Dashwood	And Mrs. Jennings too , an exceedingly well - behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter .
Fanny Dashwood	Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with .
Fanny Dashwood	""" My dear friend , "" cried Lucy , as soon as they were by themselves , "" I come to talk to you of my happiness ."
Fanny Dashwood	So exceeding affable as she was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;-- but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me .
Fanny Dashwood	Now was not it so?-- You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ?
Fanny Dashwood	""" She was certainly very civil to you . "" "" Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast deal more ."
Fanny Dashwood	"Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride , no hauteur , and your sister just the same -- all sweetness and affability ! """
Fanny Dashwood	If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way -- you know what I mean -- if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair .
Fanny Dashwood	""" "" What ! is Fanny ill ? """
Fanny Dashwood	Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes .
Fanny Dashwood	' I wish , with all my heart , ' says poor Fanny in her affectionate way , ' that we had asked your sisters instead of them . '
Fanny Dashwood	What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered , when first Fanny broke it to her , is not to be described .
Fanny Dashwood	All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement , assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments , and Fanny 's entreaties , was of no avail .
Fanny Dashwood	"I feel for him sincerely . "" A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion , concluded his visit ; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really believed there was no material danger in Fanny 's indisposition , and that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it"
Fanny Dashwood	But Elinor had no such dependence ; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars 's flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele , she feared that Robert 's offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny .
Fanny Dashwood	Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars 's heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children .
Fanny Dashwood	"He agreed that he might . "" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first . "" He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour.-- "" And if they really DO interest themselves , "" said Marianne , in her new character of candour , "" in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit . "" After a visit on Colonel Brandon 's side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to Delaford , that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on his journey to town ."
Fanny Dashwood	In spite of his being allowed once more to live , however , he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure , till he had revealed his present engagement ; for the publication of that circumstance , he feared , might give a sudden turn to his constitution , and carry him off as rapidly as before . With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed , and he was listened to with unexpected calmness . Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood , by every argument in her power;--told him , that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;-- and enforced the assertion , by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE ; but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit -- and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor . What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward 's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny .
Fanny Dashwood	and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence . Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars , as either Robert or Fanny ; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her , and Elinor , though superior to her in fortune and birth , was spoken of as an intruder , SHE was in every thing considered , and always openly acknowledged , to be a favourite child .
Fanny Dashwood	They settled in town , received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars , were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods ; and setting aside the jealousies and ill - will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy , in which their husbands of course took a part , as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves , nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together .
Colonel Brandon	"I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again""-- Elinor was obliged to turn from her , in the middle of her story , to receive the rest of the party ; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers ; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time , and they all sat down to look at one another , while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour , attended by Sir John ."
Colonel Brandon	41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett 's Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life .
Colonel Brandon	As for Colonel Brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and scarcely resolved to avail herself , at Delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry .
Colonel Brandon	"This living of Colonel Brandon's -- can it be true?--has he really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it . "" "" It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward . "" "" Really!--Well , this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no connection between them!--and now that livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this ? """
Colonel Brandon	""" Very well -- and for the next presentation to a living of that value -- supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly , and likely to vacate it soon -- he might have got I dare say -- fourteen hundred pounds . And how came he not to have settled that matter before this person 's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it , but a man of Colonel Brandon 's sense!--I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common , such natural , concern!--Well , I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character . I suppose , however -- on recollection -- that the case may probably be THIS ."
Colonel Brandon	""" Elinor contradicted it , however , very positively ; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward , and , therefore , must understand the terms on which it was given , obliged him to submit to her authority ."
Colonel Brandon	""" Well , well ; whatever Colonel Brandon may be , Edward is a very lucky man.--You"
Colonel Brandon	Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing , that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure , an acquisition of wealth to her brother , by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished .
Colonel Brandon	""" But why should such precaution be used?--Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be quite out of the question ; yet why , upon her late behaviour , is she supposed to feel at all?--She"
Colonel Brandon	has done with her son , she cast him off for ever , and has made all those over whom she had any influence , cast him off likewise .
Colonel Brandon	"Surely , after doing so , she can not be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account-- she can not be interested in any thing that befalls him.-- She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child , and yet retain the anxiety of a parent ! """
Colonel Brandon	"Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son . "" "" You surprise me ; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time . """
Colonel Brandon	"Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately ? "" Elinor had heard enough , if not to gratify her vanity , and raise her self - importance , to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself , and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother , by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars ."
Colonel Brandon	he is ruined for ever .
Colonel Brandon	I am extremely sorry for it-- for I know him to be a very good - hearted creature ; as well - meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world .
Colonel Brandon	You must not judge of him , Miss Dashwood , from YOUR slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born , you know , with the same powers,--the same address.--
Colonel Brandon	Poor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!-- to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul , I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom ; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life , as when it all burst forth .
Colonel Brandon	I could not believe it.-- My mother was the first person who told me of it ; and I , feeling myself called on to act with resolution , immediately said to her , ' My dear madam , I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion , but as for myself , I must say , that if Edward does marry this young woman , I never will see him again . '
Colonel Brandon	That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society!--but , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected .
Colonel Brandon	I offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late THEN , I found , to do any thing , for unluckily , I was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere .
Colonel Brandon	"He must be starved , you know;-- that is certain ; absolutely starved . """
Colonel Brandon	"For a short time he sat deep in thought , after Elinor had ceased to speak;--at last , and as if it were rather an effort , he said , "" Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability ."
Colonel Brandon	I have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother I know esteems him highly .
Colonel Brandon	"He is undoubtedly a sensible man , and in his manners perfectly the gentleman . "" "" Indeed , "" replied Elinor , "" I believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house , ) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this ."
Colonel Brandon	""" Edward made no answer ; but when she had turned away her head , gave her a look so serious , so earnest , so uncheerful , as seemed to say , that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion - house much greater . "" Colonel Brandon , I think , lodges in St. James Street , "" said he , soon afterwards , rising from his chair ."
Colonel Brandon	Elinor told him the number of the house .
Colonel Brandon	""" I must hurry away then , to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU ; to assure him that he has made me a very -- an exceedingly happy man ."
Colonel Brandon	""" When I see him again , "" said Elinor to herself , as the door shut him out , "" I shall see him the husband of Lucy . """
Colonel Brandon	"When Mrs. Jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared . "" Well , my dear , "" she cried , "" I sent you up to the young man ."
Colonel Brandon	"Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty -- You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ? """
Colonel Brandon	""" No , ma'am ; THAT was not very likely . "" "" Well , and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon that . """
Colonel Brandon	""" Really , "" said Elinor , "" I know so little of these kind of forms , that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time , or the preparation necessary ; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination . """
Colonel Brandon	""" My dear ma'am , "" said Elinor , "" what can you be thinking of?-- Why , Colonel Brandon 's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . """
Colonel Brandon	""" "" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living 's being enough to allow them to marry . "" "" The Colonel is a ninny , my dear ; because he has two thousand a - year himself , he thinks that nobody else can marry on less . Take my word for it , that , if I am alive , I shall"
Colonel Brandon	Mrs. Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her . His manners to THEM , though calm , were perfectly kind ; to Mrs. Jennings , most attentively civil ; and on Colonel Brandon 's coming in soon after himself , he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say , that he only wanted to know him to be rich , to be equally civil to HIM . After staying with them half an hour , he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street , and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton .
Colonel Brandon	""" Who is Colonel Brandon ?"
Colonel Brandon	Is he a man of fortune ?
Colonel Brandon	""" "" Yes ; he has very good property in Dorsetshire . "" "" I am glad of it ."
Colonel Brandon	"He seems a most gentlemanlike man ; and I think , Elinor , I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life . """
Colonel Brandon	"what do you mean ? "" "" He likes you ."
Colonel Brandon	I observed him narrowly , and am convinced of it .
Colonel Brandon	What is the amount of his fortune ?
Colonel Brandon	""" Indeed I believe you , "" replied Elinor ; "" but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME ."
Colonel Brandon	A very little trouble on your side secures him .
Colonel Brandon	Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it .
Colonel Brandon	But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself .
Colonel Brandon	And there can be no reason why you should not try for him .
Colonel Brandon	Colonel Brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family .
Colonel Brandon	"I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . "" Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon ; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished , and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman , and promoting the marriage by every possible attention . He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself , to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal ; and an offer from Colonel Brandon , or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings , was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect ."
Colonel Brandon	Luckily Lady Middleton 's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . The young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . Mrs. Jennings , Lady Middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . She was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . Marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs. Jennings 's . Colonel Brandon , the friend of Sir John , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than Lady Middleton was to be his wife , or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton 's mother . He was silent and grave .
Colonel Brandon	His appearance however was not unpleasing , in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor , for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty ; but though his face was not handsome , his countenance was sensible , and his address was particularly gentlemanlike .
Colonel Brandon	There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother - in - law was interesting .
Colonel Brandon	Colonel Brandon alone , of all the party , heard her without being in raptures .
Colonel Brandon	He paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste .
Colonel Brandon	His pleasure in music , though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own , was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others ; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment .
Colonel Brandon	She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel 's advanced state of life which humanity required .
Colonel Brandon	But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister 's composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against Marianne inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm . A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings 's advice , of sending for the Palmers ' apothecary .
Colonel Brandon	Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris 's arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer 's , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.--Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister 's account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c.
Colonel Brandon	To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the latter , was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance ; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister , she hastened down to the drawing - room , where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present . It was no time for hesitation .
Colonel Brandon	The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon -- or such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully was it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide , whose attendance must relieve , and whose friendship might soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons COULD be lessened to her , his presence , his manners , his assistance , would lessen it .
Colonel Brandon	The horses arrived , even before they were expected , and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity , and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear , hurried into the carriage .
Colonel Brandon	The time was now drawing on , when Colonel Brandon might be expected back . At ten o'clock , she trusted , or at least not much later her mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be travelling towards them .
Colonel Brandon	She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend;-- and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon 's hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment . He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own . As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger .
Colonel Brandon	She dreaded the performance of it , dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be ; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another ; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower . Then , remembering Colonel Brandon , reproved herself , felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival 's , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby 's death .
Colonel Brandon	The shock of Colonel Brandon 's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm ; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne , that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day , without waiting for any further intelligence , and had so far settled her journey before his arrival , that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away , as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection .
Colonel Brandon	"He has told me so himself . "" Her daughter , feeling by turns both pleased and pained , surprised and not surprised , was all silent attention . """
Colonel Brandon	Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family , I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon 's marrying one of you as the object most desirable .
Colonel Brandon	"And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two . "" Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so , because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age , characters , or feelings , could be given;--but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject , and therefore instead of an inquiry , she passed it off with a smile . """
Colonel Brandon	He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled .
Colonel Brandon	I , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal his distress ; I saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy -- or rather , not thinking at all , I suppose -- giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for Marianne .
Colonel Brandon	He has loved her , my Elinor , ever since the first moment of seeing her .
Colonel Brandon	""" Here , however , Elinor perceived,--not the language , not the professions of Colonel Brandon , but the natural embellishments of her mother 's active fancy , which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose ."
Colonel Brandon	""" His regard for her , infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned , as much more warm ,"
Colonel Brandon	as more sincere or constant -- which ever we are to call it-- has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne 's unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!--and without selfishness -- without encouraging a hope!--could he have seen her happy with another -- Such a noble mind!-- such openness , such sincerity!--no one can be deceived in HIM .
Colonel Brandon	""" Colonel Brandon 's character , "" said Elinor , "" as an excellent man , is well established ."
Colonel Brandon	""" I know it is""--replied her mother seriously , "" or after such a warning , I should be the last to encourage such affection , or even to be pleased by it . But his coming for me as he did , with such active , such ready friendship , is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men ."
Colonel Brandon	""" His character , however , "" answered Elinor , "" does not rest on ONE act of kindness , to which his affection for Marianne , were humanity out of the case , would have prompted him ."
Colonel Brandon	"To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him?--Did you allow him to hope ? "" "" Oh !"
Colonel Brandon	Marianne might at that moment be dying .
Colonel Brandon	But he did not ask for hope or encouragement .
Colonel Brandon	His was an involuntary confidence , an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend -- not an application to a parent .
Colonel Brandon	Yet after a time I DID say , for at first I was quite overcome -- that if she lived , as I trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , I have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power .
Colonel Brandon	Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything;--Marianne 's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.-- His own merits must soon secure it .
Colonel Brandon	"Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother , without waiting for her assent , continued , "" And his manners , the Colonel 's manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby 's ever were , but they"
Colonel Brandon	"Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness -- often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other . I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be with Colonel Brandon . "" She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree with her , but her dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence ."
Colonel Brandon	""" His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , I am sure it must be a good one . """
Colonel Brandon	""" "" To judge from the Colonel 's spirits , however , you have not yet made him equally sanguine . "" "" No.--He thinks Marianne 's affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time , and even supposing her heart again free , is too diffident of himself to believe , that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her ."
Colonel Brandon	There , however , he is quite mistaken .
Colonel Brandon	His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed;--and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy .
Colonel Brandon	And his person , his manners too , are all in his favour .
Colonel Brandon	"Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother , without waiting for her assent , continued , "" And his manners , the Colonel 's manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby 's ever were , but they"
Colonel Brandon	"Marianne moved to the window-- "" It is Colonel Brandon ! "" said she , with vexation ."
Colonel Brandon	""" He will not come in , as Mrs. Jennings is from home . "" "" I will not trust to THAT , "" retreating to her own room ."
Colonel Brandon	""" A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . "" The event proved her conjecture right , though it was founded on injustice and error ; for Colonel Brandon DID come in ; and Elinor , who was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither , and who saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look , and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her , could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly ."
Colonel Brandon	""" I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street , "" said he , after the first salutation , "" and she encouraged me to come on ; and I was the more easily encouraged , because I thought it probable that I might find you alone , which I was very desirous of doing ."
Colonel Brandon	My object -- my wish -- my sole wish in desiring it -- I hope , I believe it is -- is to be a means of giving comfort;--no , I must not say comfort -- not present comfort -- but conviction , lasting conviction to your sister 's mind .
Colonel Brandon	My regard for her , for yourself , for your mother -- will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere regard -- nothing but an earnest desire of being useful -- I think I am justified -- though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right , is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong ?
Colonel Brandon	He stopped .
Colonel Brandon	""" I understand you , "" said Elinor ."
Colonel Brandon	""" You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby , that will open his character farther ."
Colonel Brandon	Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne .
Colonel Brandon	Pray , pray let me hear it .
Colonel Brandon	""" You shall ; and , to be brief , when I quitted Barton last October,--but this will give you no idea -- I must go farther back ."
Colonel Brandon	You will find me a very awkward narrator , Miss Dashwood ; I hardly know where to begin .
Colonel Brandon	A short account of myself , I believe , will be necessary , and it SHALL be a short one .
Colonel Brandon	"On such a subject , "" sighing heavily , "" can I have little temptation to be diffuse . "" He stopt a moment for recollection , and then , with another sigh , went on . """
Colonel Brandon	You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation-- ( it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park -- it was the evening of a dance -- in which I alluded to a lady I had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister Marianne .
Colonel Brandon	"He looked pleased by this remembrance , and added , "" If I am not deceived by the uncertainty , the partiality of tender recollection , there is a very strong resemblance between them , as well in mind as person ."
Colonel Brandon	This lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father .
Colonel Brandon	I can not remember the time when I did not love Eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt . Her 's , for me , was , I believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate . At seventeen she was lost to me for ever .
Colonel Brandon	She was married -- married against her inclination to my brother . Her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered .
Colonel Brandon	My brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her .
Colonel Brandon	The treachery , or the folly , of my cousin 's maid betrayed us .
Colonel Brandon	I was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father 's point was gained .
Colonel Brandon	My brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly .
Colonel Brandon	But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ?
Colonel Brandon	"Had I remained in England , perhaps -- but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange . The shock which her marriage had given me , "" he continued , in a voice of great agitation , "" was of trifling weight -- was nothing to what I felt when I heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce . It was THAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection of what I suffered-- "" He could say no more , and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room . Elinor , affected by his relation , and still more by his distress , could not speak ."
Colonel Brandon	He saw her concern , and coming to her , took her hand , pressed it , and kissed it with grateful respect .
Colonel Brandon	"A few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure . """
Colonel Brandon	It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned to England .
Colonel Brandon	My first care , when I DID arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy .
Colonel Brandon	"I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life : I was with her in her last moments . "" Again he stopped to recover himself ; and Elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern , at the fate of his unfortunate friend ."
Colonel Brandon	""" Your sister , I hope , can not be offended , "" said he , "" by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation ."
Colonel Brandon	I seem to have been distressing you for nothing .
Colonel Brandon	I WILL be more collected -- more concise .
Colonel Brandon	She left to my care her only child , a little girl , the offspring of her first guilty connection , who was then about three years old .
Colonel Brandon	To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister -- but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister 's influence might yet reclaim him .
Colonel Brandon	"Have you , "" she continued , after a short silence , "" ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton ?"
Colonel Brandon	""" "" Yes , "" he replied gravely , "" once I have ."
Colonel Brandon	"Elinor , startled by his manner , looked at him anxiously , saying , "" What ? have you met him to-- "" "" I could meet him no other way ."
Colonel Brandon	""" Such , "" said Colonel Brandon , after a pause , "" has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter !"
Colonel Brandon	"and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust ! "" "" Is she still in town ? "" """
Colonel Brandon	"No ; as soon as she recovered from her lying - in , for I found her near her delivery , I removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains . "" Recollecting , soon afterwards , that he was probably dividing Elinor from her sister , he put an end to his visit , receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments , and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him ."
Colonel Brandon	"and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him . "" "" Ah ! "" said Colonel Brandon , "" there is , indeed !"
Colonel Brandon	"But your sister does not -- I think you said so -- she does not consider quite as you do ? """
Colonel Brandon	""" You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . "" He made no answer ; and soon afterwards , by the removal of the tea - things , and the arrangement of the card parties , the subject was necessarily dropped ."
Colonel Brandon	Mrs. Jennings , who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking , and who expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood 's communication , in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon 's side , as might have become a man in the bloom of youth , of hope and happiness , saw him , with amazement , remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual .
Colonel Brandon	Nothing could replace him , therefore , in her former esteem , nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon .
Colonel Brandon	"That crime has been the origin of every lesser one , and of all his present discontents . "" Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark ; and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon 's injuries and merits , warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate . Her daughter did not look , however , as if much of it were heard by her ."
Colonel Brandon	She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London , nothing new of his plans , nothing certain even of his present abode . Some letters had passed between her and her brother , in consequence of Marianne 's illness ; and in the first of John 's , there had been this sentence:--
Colonel Brandon	"Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he took it , looked at the direction , changed colour , and immediately left the room . "" What is the matter with Brandon ? "" said Sir John . Nobody could tell ."
Colonel Brandon	""" I hope he has had no bad news , "" said Lady Middleton . """
Colonel Brandon	It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly .
Colonel Brandon	""" In about five minutes he returned ."
Colonel Brandon	""" No bad news , Colonel , I hope ; "" said Mrs. Jennings , as soon as he entered the room ."
Colonel Brandon	""" None at all , ma'am , I thank you ."
Colonel Brandon	""" Was it from Avignon ? I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse ."
Colonel Brandon	"It came from town , and is merely a letter of business . "" "" But how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ?"
Colonel Brandon	"Come , come , this wo n't do , Colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it . """
Colonel Brandon	""" My dear madam , "" said Lady Middleton , "" recollect what you are saying . "" "" Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married ? "" said Mrs. Jennings , without attending to her daughter 's reproof ."
Colonel Brandon	""" Well , then , I know who it is from , Colonel ."
Colonel Brandon	""" Whom do you mean , ma'am ? "" said he , colouring a little ."
Colonel Brandon	""" I am particularly sorry , ma'am , "" said he , addressing Lady Middleton , "" that I should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town ."
Colonel Brandon	""" What can you have to do in town at this time of year ? """
Colonel Brandon	""" My own loss is great , "" be continued , "" in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ; but I am the more concerned , as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell ."
Colonel Brandon	""" But if you write a note to the housekeeper , Mr. Brandon , "" said Marianne , eagerly , "" will it not be sufficient ? """
Colonel Brandon	He shook his head .
Colonel Brandon	"You can not go to town till tomorrow , Brandon , that is all . """
Colonel Brandon	""" I wish it could be so easily settled ."
Colonel Brandon	But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day !
Colonel Brandon	""" If you would but let us know what your business is , "" said Mrs. Jennings , "" we might see whether it could be put off or not . "" "" You would not be six hours later , "" said Willoughby , "" if you were to defer your journey till our return . "" "" I can not afford to lose ONE hour . ""-- Elinor then heard Willoughby say , in a low voice to Marianne , "" There are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . Brandon is one of them ."
Colonel Brandon	He was afraid of catching cold I dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it .
Colonel Brandon	I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing .
Colonel Brandon	""" There is no persuading you to change your mind , Brandon , I know of old , "" said Sir John , "" when once you are determined on anything . But , however , I hope you will think better of it ."
Colonel Brandon	Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party ; but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable .
Colonel Brandon	""" Well , then , when will you come back again ?"
Colonel Brandon	""" I hope we shall see you at Barton , "" added her ladyship , "" as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return ."
Colonel Brandon	"But it is so uncertain , when I may have it in my power to return , that I dare not engage for it at all . "" "" Oh !"
Colonel Brandon	"he must and shall come back , "" cried Sir John ."
Colonel Brandon	""" If he is not here by the end of the week , I shall go after him . "" "" Ay , so do , Sir John , "" cried Mrs. Jennings , "" and then perhaps you may find out what his business is ."
Colonel Brandon	""" I do not want to pry into other men 's concerns ."
Colonel Brandon	"I suppose it is something he is ashamed of . "" Colonel Brandon 's horses were announced ."
Colonel Brandon	""" You do not go to town on horseback , do you ? "" added Sir John ."
Colonel Brandon	""" "" Well , as you are resolved to go , I wish you a good journey ."
Colonel Brandon	"But you had better change your mind . """
Colonel Brandon	""" I assure you it is not in my power . """
Colonel Brandon	He then took leave of the whole party .
Colonel Brandon	Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ?
Colonel Brandon	""" Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do . "" To Marianne , he merely bowed and said nothing ."
Colonel Brandon	""" Come Colonel , "" said Mrs. Jennings , "" before you go , do let us know what you are going about . """
Colonel Brandon	He wished her a good morning , and , attended by Sir John , left the room .
Colonel Brandon	""" I can guess what his business is , however , "" said Mrs. Jennings exultingly ."
Colonel Brandon	She is a relation of the Colonel 's , my dear ; a very near relation .
Colonel Brandon	""" Then , lowering her voice a little , she said to Elinor , "" She is his natural daughter . "" "" Indeed ! "" "" Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune . "" When Sir John returned , he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event ; concluding however by observing , that as they were all got together , they must do something by way of being happy ; and after some consultation it was agreed , that although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell , they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country ."
Colonel Brandon	He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception . It was his business , however , to say that he DID , and he said it very prettily . What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after , must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives . That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive , to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas , was perfectly clear to Elinor ; and Edward himself , now thoroughly enlightened on her character , had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill - nature . Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions-- they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well - disposed , good - hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself .
Colonel Brandon	She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living .
Colonel Brandon	"Elinor smiled , and shook her head . Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon 's being expected at the Cottage , as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him , but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of Delaford--""Which , at present , "" said he , "" after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion , he must think I have never forgiven him for offering . "" NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place . But so little interest had be taken in the matter , that he owed all his knowledge of the house , garden , and glebe , extent of the parish , condition of the land , and rate of the tithes , to Elinor herself , who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon , and heard it with so much attention , as to be entirely mistress of the subject . One question after this only remained undecided , between them , one difficulty only was to be overcome ."
Colonel Brandon	About four days after Edward 's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared , to complete Mrs. Dashwood 's satisfaction , and to give her the dignity of having , for the first time since her living at Barton , more company with her than her house would hold .
Colonel Brandon	Edward was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer , and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the Park ; from whence he usually returned in the morning , early enough to interrupt the lovers ' first tete - a - tete before breakfast .
Colonel Brandon	"He agreed that he might . "" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first . "" He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour.-- "" And if they really DO interest themselves , "" said Marianne , in her new character of candour , "" in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit . "" After a visit on Colonel Brandon 's side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to Delaford , that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on his journey to town ."
Colonel Brandon	With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them , they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living , but the readiness of the house , to which Colonel Brandon , with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor , was making considerable improvements ; and after waiting some time for their completion , after experiencing , as usual , a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen , Elinor , as usual , broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready , and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn .
Colonel Brandon	They had in fact nothing to wish for , but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne , and rather better pasturage for their cows .
Colonel Brandon	""" I will not say that I am disappointed , my dear sister , "" said John , as they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford House , "" THAT would be saying too much , for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world , as it is . But , I confess , it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother . His property here , his place , his house , every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire , as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though , perhaps , Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him-- yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you , for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home , nobody can tell what may happen -- for , when people are much thrown together , and see little of anybody else -- and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage , and so forth;-- in short , you may as well give her a chance -- You understand me . ""--"
Colonel Brandon	Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford ; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest , though rather more liberal than what John had expressed .
Colonel Brandon	Colonel Brandon was now as happy , as all those who best loved him , believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to animation , and his spirits to cheerfulness ; and that Marianne found her own happiness in forming his , was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend .
Colonel Brandon	Marianne could never love by halves ; and her whole heart became , in time , as much devoted to her husband , as it had once been to Willoughby . Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang ; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith , who , by stating his marriage with a woman of character , as the source of her clemency
Colonel Brandon	, gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards Marianne , he might at once have been happy and rich .
Colonel Brandon	That his repentance of misconduct , which thus brought its own punishment , was sincere , need not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of Colonel Brandon with envy , and of Marianne with regret . But that he was for ever inconsolable , that he fled from society , or contracted an habitual gloom of temper , or died of a broken heart , must not be depended on -- for he did neither . He lived to exert , and frequently to enjoy himself .
Colonel Brandon	His wife was not always out of humour , nor his home always uncomfortable ; and in his breed of horses and dogs , and in sporting of every kind , he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity . For Marianne , however -- in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss -- he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her , and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;-- and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after - days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon .
Colonel Brandon	""" Disappointment ? "" "" Yes , for I am unable to keep my engagement with you . Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin , by sending me on business to London . I have just received my dispatches , and taken my farewell of Allenham ; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you . "" "" To London!--and are you going this morning ? "" "" Almost this moment . "" "" This is very unfortunate ."
Colonel Brandon	"But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from us long I hope . "" He coloured as he replied , "" You are very kind , but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately ."
Colonel Brandon	"My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth . "" "" And is Mrs. Smith your only friend ?"
Colonel Brandon	Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome ?
Robert Ferrars	""" I am sure , "" said she , "" I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say ."
Robert Ferrars	Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom -- we can hardly meet above twice a - year .
Robert Ferrars	""" But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it.-- I can not bear the thoughts of making him so miserable , as I know the very mention of such a thing would do ."
Robert Ferrars	And on my own account too -- so dear as he is to me -- I do n't think I could be equal to it .
Robert Ferrars	""" To be sure , "" continued Lucy , after a few minutes silence on both sides , "" his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor Edward is so cast down by it !"
Robert Ferrars	Yes , I have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even THAT .
Robert Ferrars	""" Choice!--how do you mean ? "" "" I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert . "" """
Robert Ferrars	Certainly , there can be no difference ; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;--and
Robert Ferrars	After a few moments ' chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister 's being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother 's love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother 's integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart .
Robert Ferrars	They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves , before he began to speak of Edward ; for he , too , had heard of the living , and was very inquisitive on the subject .
Robert Ferrars	Elinor repeated the particulars of it , as she had given them to John ; and their effect on Robert , though very different , was not less striking than it had been on HIM . He laughed most immoderately .
Robert Ferrars	For many years of her life she had had two sons ; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago , had robbed her of one ; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any ; and now , by the resuscitation of Edward , she had one again .
Robert Ferrars	In spite of his being allowed once more to live , however , he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure , till he had revealed his present engagement ; for the publication of that circumstance , he feared , might give a sudden turn to his constitution , and carry him off as rapidly as before . With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed , and he was listened to with unexpected calmness . Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood , by every argument in her power;--told him , that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;-- and enforced the assertion , by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE ; but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit -- and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor . What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward 's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny .
Robert Ferrars	THAT was due to the folly of Robert , and the cunning of his wife ; and it was earned by them before many months had passed away .
Robert Ferrars	The selfish sagacity of the latter , which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape , was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it ; for her respectful humility , assiduous attentions , and endless flatteries , as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise , reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice , and re - established him completely in her favour .
Robert Ferrars	When Robert first sought her acquaintance , and privately visited her in Bartlett 's Buildings , it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother .
Robert Ferrars	He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement ; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both , he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter .
Robert Ferrars	In that point , however , and that only , he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME , another visit , another conversation , was always wanted to produce this conviction .
Robert Ferrars	Some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted , which could only be removed by another half hour 's discourse with himself . His attendance was by this means secured , and the rest followed in course .
Robert Ferrars	Instead of talking of Edward , they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other , and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own ; and in short , it became speedily evident to both , that he had entirely supplanted his brother .
Robert Ferrars	The forgiveness , at first , indeed , as was reasonable , comprehended only Robert ; and Lucy , who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none , still remained some weeks longer unpardoned .
Robert Ferrars	But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages , in self - condemnation for Robert 's offence ,
Robert Ferrars	and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence . Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars , as either Robert or Fanny ; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her , and Elinor , though superior to her in fortune and birth , was spoken of as an intruder , SHE was in every thing considered , and always openly acknowledged , to be a favourite child .
Robert Ferrars	They settled in town , received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars , were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods ; and setting aside the jealousies and ill - will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy , in which their husbands of course took a part , as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves , nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together .
Robert Ferrars	What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son , might have puzzled many people to find out ; and what Robert had done to succeed to it , might have puzzled them still more .
Robert Ferrars	It was an arrangement , however , justified in its effects , if not in its cause ; for nothing ever appeared in Robert 's style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income , as either leaving his brother too little , or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular , from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home , and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits , he might be supposed no less contented with his lot , no less free from every wish of an exchange .
John Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood was denied ; but before the carriage could turn from the house , her husband accidentally came out .
John Dashwood	He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor , told her that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street , and , assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her , invited her to come in .
John Dashwood	""" Fanny is in her own room , I suppose , "" said he:--""I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it , indeed ."
John Dashwood	""" I am not sorry to see you alone , "" he replied , "" for I have a good deal to say to you ."
John Dashwood	"Elinor , "" said John , "" your reasoning is very good , but it is founded on ignorance of human nature ."
John Dashwood	"Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son . "" "" You surprise me ; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time . """
John Dashwood	"Elinor , smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother 's tone , calmly replied , "" The lady , I suppose , has no choice in the affair . """
John Dashwood	""" Choice!--how do you mean ? "" "" I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert . "" """
John Dashwood	"as to any thing else , they are both very agreeable young men : I do not know that one is superior to the other . "" Elinor said no more , and John was also for a short time silent.--His"
John Dashwood	reflections ended thus .
John Dashwood	""" Of ONE thing , my dear sister , "" kindly taking her hand , and speaking in an awful whisper,--""I may assure you;-- and I WILL do it , because I know it must gratify you ."
John Dashwood	I have good reason to think -- indeed I have it from the best authority , or I should not repeat it , for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it -- but I have it from the very best authority -- not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself -- but her daughter DID , and I have it from her -- That in short , whatever objections there might be against a certain -- a certain connection -- you understand me -- it would have been far preferable to her , it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does .
John Dashwood	But however , all that is quite out of the question -- not to be thought of or mentioned-- as to any attachment you know -- it never could be -- all that is gone by . But I thought I would just tell you of this , because I knew how much it must please you .
John Dashwood	Not that you have any reason to regret , my dear Elinor .
John Dashwood	After a few moments ' chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister 's being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother 's love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother 's integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart .
John Dashwood	Elinor repeated the particulars of it , as she had given them to John ; and their effect on Robert , though very different , was not less striking than it had been on HIM . He laughed most immoderately .
John Dashwood	The late owner of this estate was a single man , who lived to a very advanced age , and who for many years of his life , had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister . But her death , which happened ten years before his own , produced a great alteration in his home ; for to supply her loss , he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood , the legal inheritor of the Norland estate , and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it .
John Dashwood	In the society of his nephew and niece , and their children , the old Gentleman 's days were comfortably spent .
John Dashwood	His attachment to them all increased .
John Dashwood	The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes , which proceeded not merely from interest , but from goodness of heart , gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive ; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence .
John Dashwood	By a former marriage , Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son : by his present lady , three daughters .
John Dashwood	Their mother had nothing , and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal ; for the remaining moiety of his first wife 's fortune was also secured to her child , and he had only a life - interest in it . The old gentleman died : his will was read , and like almost every other will , gave as much disappointment as pleasure . He was neither so unjust , nor so ungrateful , as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest .
John Dashwood	Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son;--but
John Dashwood	to his son , and his son 's son , a child of four years old , it was secured , in such a way , as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him , and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate , or by any sale of its valuable woods .
John Dashwood	Mr. Dashwood 's disappointment was , at first , severe ; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine ; and he might reasonably hope to live many years , and by living economically , lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large , and capable of almost immediate improvement .
John Dashwood	But the fortune , which had been so tardy in coming , was his only one twelvemonth . He survived his uncle no longer ; and ten thousand pounds , including the late legacies , was all that remained for his widow and daughters .
John Dashwood	His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known , and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended , with all the strength and urgency which illness could command , the interest of his mother - in - law and sisters .
John Dashwood	Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family ; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time , and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable .
John Dashwood	His father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them . He was not an ill - disposed young man , unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill - disposed : but he was , in general , well respected ; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties . Had he married a more amiable woman , he might have been made still more respectable than he was:--he might even have been made amiable himself ; for he was very young when he married , and very fond of his wife .
John Dashwood	No one could dispute her right to come ; the house was her husband 's from the moment of his father 's decease ; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater , and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood 's situation , with only common feelings , must have been highly unpleasing;-- but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen , a generosity so romantic , that any offence of the kind , by whomsoever given or received , was to her a source of immoveable disgust .
John Dashwood	Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband 's family ; but she had had no opportunity , till the present , of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it .
John Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour , which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections .
John Dashwood	She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself , and she thought of it for her daughters ' sake with satisfaction , though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her in affluence .
John Dashwood	Do but consider , my dear Mr. Dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother - in - law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a - piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it .
John Dashwood	I am sure I can not imagine how they will spend half of it ; and as to your giving them more , it is quite absurd to think of it .
John Dashwood	""" Upon my word , "" said Mr. Dashwood , "" I believe you are perfectly right . My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say ."
John Dashwood	I clearly understand it now , and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described .
John Dashwood	When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can .
John Dashwood	When your father and mother moved to Norland , though the furniture of Stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother .
John Dashwood	""" Yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house . A great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place THEY can ever afford to live in . But , however , so it is ."
John Dashwood	Your father thought only of THEM .
John Dashwood	And I must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM .
John Dashwood	It gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before ; and he finally resolved , that it would be absolutely unnecessary , if not highly indecorous , to do more for the widow and children of his father , than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out .
John Dashwood	Mr. Dashwood 's strains were more solemn .
John Dashwood	Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women -- poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility -- and he considered the existence of each , under such a blow , with grateful wonder .
John Dashwood	The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them , was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime , because , had any suspicion of it occurred to the others , proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage ; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy 's engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled , than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.--
John Dashwood	"He thus continued : "" Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward 's name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a line has been received from him on the occasion ."
John Dashwood	Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars 's heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children .
John Dashwood	"He agreed that he might . "" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first . "" He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour.-- "" And if they really DO interest themselves , "" said Marianne , in her new character of candour , "" in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit . "" After a visit on Colonel Brandon 's side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to Delaford , that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on his journey to town ."
John Dashwood	""" I will not say that I am disappointed , my dear sister , "" said John , as they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford House , "" THAT would be saying too much , for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world , as it is . But , I confess , it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother . His property here , his place , his house , every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire , as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though , perhaps , Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him-- yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you , for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home , nobody can tell what may happen -- for , when people are much thrown together , and see little of anybody else -- and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage , and so forth;-- in short , you may as well give her a chance -- You understand me . ""--"
John Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford ; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest , though rather more liberal than what John had expressed .
John Dashwood	Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage , without attempting a removal to Delaford ; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , when Marianne was taken from them , Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing , and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover .
Mrs. Ferrars	Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture . He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture was all sent around by water . It chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne 's .
Mrs. Ferrars	She knew that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment , they believed the next -- that with them , to wish was to hope , and to hope was to expect . She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister .
Mrs. Ferrars	What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank .
Mrs. Ferrars	""" Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth ."
Mrs. Ferrars	""" And you really are not engaged to him ! "" said she ."
Mrs. Ferrars	I shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . Oh !
Mrs. Ferrars	A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection . She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present , nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself , without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement .
Mrs. Ferrars	She was far from depending on that result of his preference of her , which her mother and sister still considered as certain . Nay , the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard ; and sometimes , for a few painful minutes , she believed it to be no more than friendship .
Mrs. Ferrars	She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother - in - law on the occasion , talking to her so expressively of her brother 's great expectations , of Mrs. Ferrars 's resolution that both her sons should marry well , and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN ; that Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious , nor endeavor to be calm .
Mrs. Ferrars	She gave her an answer which marked her contempt , and instantly left the room , resolving that , whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal , her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations . In this state of her spirits , a letter was delivered to her from the post , which contained a proposal particularly well timed . It was the offer of a small house , on very easy terms , belonging to a relation of her own , a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire .
Mrs. Ferrars	On THAT head , therefore , it was not for her to oppose her mother 's intention of removing into Devonshire .
Mrs. Ferrars	The house , too , as described by Sir John , was on so simple a scale , and the rent so uncommonly moderate , as to leave her no right of objection on either point ; and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence .
Mrs. Ferrars	Elinor 's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable.-- She had seen enough of her pride , her meanness , and her determined prejudice against herself , to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement , and retarded the marriage , of Edward and herself , had he been otherwise free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake , that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars 's creation , preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice , or any solicitude for her good opinion .
Mrs. Ferrars	She wondered that Lucy 's spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was NOT ELINOR , appear a compliment to herself -- or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her , because her real situation was unknown .
Mrs. Ferrars	Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars 's way of treating me yesterday ?
Mrs. Ferrars	So exceeding affable as she was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;-- but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me .
Mrs. Ferrars	""" She was certainly very civil to you . "" "" Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast deal more ."
Mrs. Ferrars	"Elinor wished to talk of something else , but Lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness ; and Elinor was obliged to go on.-- "" Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement , "" said she , "" nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was not the case""-- "" I guessed you would say so""--replied Lucy quickly--""but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing ."
Mrs. Ferrars	Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister .
Mrs. Ferrars	"But it seemed to satisfy Lucy , for she directly replied , "" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward 's love , it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton 's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;-- and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me.--"
Mrs. Ferrars	I am sure I should have seen it in a moment , if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me .
Mrs. Ferrars	If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way -- you know what I mean -- if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair .
Mrs. Ferrars	"For where she DOES dislike , I know it is most violent . "" Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph , by the door 's being thrown open , the servant 's announcing Mr. Ferrars , and Edward 's immediately walking in . It was a very awkward moment ; and the countenance of each shewed that it was so . They all looked exceedingly foolish ; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again , as to advance farther into it ."
Mrs. Ferrars	Lucy , with a demure and settled air , seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others , and would not say a word ; and almost every thing that WAS said , proceeded from Elinor , who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother 's health , their coming to town , & c. which Edward ought to have inquired about , but never did .
Mrs. Ferrars	"Edward was the first to speak , and it was to notice Marianne 's altered looks , and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her . "" Oh , do n't think of me ! "" she replied with spirited earnestness , though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke , "" do n't think of MY health ."
Mrs. Ferrars	"So dull , so wretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head , which can not be said now . "" And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever , and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother , till they were more in private ."
Mrs. Ferrars	The nature of her commendation , in the present case , however , happened to be particularly ill - suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors , and was so very unexhilarating to Edward , that he very soon got up to go away .
Mrs. Ferrars	out directly . Well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;-- till this very morning , poor Nancy , who , you know , is a well - meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out .
Mrs. Ferrars	Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others;--represented it , therefore , as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother , whom she so much wished to see , in a more eligible , more comfortable manner , than any other plan could do , and perhaps without any greater delay . From Cleveland , which was within a few miles of Bristol , the distance to Barton was not beyond one day , though a long day 's journey ; and their mother 's servant might easily come there to attend them down ; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland , they might now be at home in little more than three weeks ' time .
Mrs. Ferrars	As Marianne 's affection for her mother was sincere , it must triumph with little difficulty , over the imaginary evils she had started .
Mrs. Ferrars	"Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother 's concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;-- and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton . "" Ah !"
Mrs. Ferrars	""" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty,""--he replied , with great feeling,--""of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to ."
Mrs. Ferrars	What an ill - natured woman his mother is , an't she ?
Mrs. Ferrars	I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother 's anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and
Mrs. Ferrars	""" "" I know it -- I know it , "" cried her mother ."
Mrs. Ferrars	""" Happy with a man of libertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends , and the best of men!--No -- my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience , her sensitive conscience , would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt . """
Mrs. Ferrars	""" Rather say your mother 's imprudence , my child , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ; "" SHE must be answerable . """
Mrs. Ferrars	"That crime has been the origin of every lesser one , and of all his present discontents . "" Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark ; and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon 's injuries and merits , warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate . Her daughter did not look , however , as if much of it were heard by her ."
Mrs. Ferrars	and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the maid , returned to Elinor , who , though still much disordered , had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas , as to the source of his intelligence . Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself ; and Elinor
Mrs. Ferrars	""" They come straight from town , as Miss Lucy-- Mrs. Ferrars told me . "" "" And are they going farther westward ?"
Mrs. Ferrars	She observed in a low voice , to her mother , that they were probably going down to Mr. Pratt 's , near Plymouth .
Mrs. Ferrars	""" No , ma'am -- the horses were just coming out , but I could not bide any longer ; I was afraid of being late . "" "" Did Mrs. Ferrars look well ? "" "" Yes , ma'am , she said how she was very well ; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady -- and she seemed vastly contented . "" Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question , and Thomas and the tablecloth , now alike needless , were soon afterwards dismissed ."
Mrs. Ferrars	"As soon as they entered the house , Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears , "" Tell mama , "" withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up stairs ."
Mrs. Ferrars	The reason alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the year .
Mrs. Ferrars	I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I 've quite set my heart upon it .
Mrs. Ferrars	I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I do n't get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault .
Mrs. Ferrars	But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother,--I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence -- Oh !
Mrs. Ferrars	"It should not , must not be a struggle . "" Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare them perfectly well ; and Elinor , who now understood her sister , and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again , made no farther direct opposition to the plan , and merely referred it to her mother 's decision , from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit , which she could not approve of for Marianne , and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid . Whatever Marianne was desirous of , her mother would be eager to promote -- she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust ; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London . That Marianne , fastidious as she was , thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings ' manners , and invariably disgusted by them , should overlook every inconvenience of that kind , should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings , in her pursuit of one object , was such a proof , so strong , so full , of the importance of that object to her , as Elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness ."
Mrs. Ferrars	""" That is very true , "" replied her mother , "" but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton ."
Mrs. Ferrars	"You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law 's family . "" Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother 's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself , that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed , and now on this attack , though almost hopeless of success , she forced herself to begin her design by saying , as calmly as she could , "" I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . """
Mrs. Ferrars	when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan , and her sister exhilarated by it in look , voice , and manner , restored to all her usual animation , and elevated to more than her usual gaiety , she could not be dissatisfied with the cause , and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence .
Mrs. Ferrars	Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness ; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive .
Mrs. Ferrars	Her mother 's affliction was hardly less , and Elinor was the only one of the three , who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal .
Mrs. Ferrars	after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement , contracted without his mother 's consent , as he had already done for more than four years , nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of THAT , than the immediate contraction of another .
Mrs. Ferrars	This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table at four o'clock , about three hours after his arrival , he had secured his lady , engaged her mother 's consent , and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover , but , in the reality of reason and truth , one of the happiest of men .
Mrs. Ferrars	But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen . I had therefore nothing in the world to do , but to fancy myself in love ; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable , as I had no friend , no companion in my brother , and disliked new acquaintance , it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple , where I always felt myself at home , and was always sure of a welcome ; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen : Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging . She was pretty too -- at least I thought so THEN ; and I had seen so little of other women , that I could make no comparisons , and see no defects .
Mrs. Ferrars	Mrs. Dashwood , too happy to be comfortable , knew not how to love Edward , nor praise Elinor enough , how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy , nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together , and yet enjoy , as she wished , the sight and society of both .
Mrs. Ferrars	And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment .
Mrs. Ferrars	The independence she settled on Robert , through resentment against you , has put it in his power to make his own choice ; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a - year , to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do .
Mrs. Ferrars	She will hardly be less hurt , I suppose , by Robert 's marrying Lucy , than she would have been by your marrying her .
Mrs. Ferrars	""" "" She will be more hurt by it , for Robert always was her favourite.--She will be more hurt by it , and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner ."
Mrs. Ferrars	Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement , which , long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother 's anger , had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him .
Mrs. Ferrars	""" I thought it my duty , "" said he , "" independent of my feelings , to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not , when I was renounced by my mother , and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me . In such a situation as that , where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature , how could I suppose , when she so earnestly , so warmly insisted on sharing my fate , whatever it might be , that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement ? And even now , I can not comprehend on what motive she acted , or what fancied advantage it could be to her , to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard , and who had only two thousand pounds in the world ."
Mrs. Ferrars	She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living .
Mrs. Ferrars	""" No ; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour ; that your own family might in time relent . And at any rate , she lost nothing by continuing the engagement , for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions . The connection was certainly a respectable one , and probably gained her consideration among her friends ; and , if nothing more advantageous occurred , it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single . """
Mrs. Ferrars	They were brought together by mutual affection , with the warmest approbation of their real friends ; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain -- and they only wanted something to live upon . Edward had two thousand pounds , and Elinor one , which , with Delaford living , was all that they could call their own ; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood should advance anything ; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a - year would supply them with the comforts of life .
Mrs. Ferrars	Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him ; and on THAT he rested for the residue of their income .
Mrs. Ferrars	About four days after Edward 's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared , to complete Mrs. Dashwood 's satisfaction , and to give her the dignity of having , for the first time since her living at Barton , more company with her than her house would hold .
Mrs. Ferrars	A three weeks ' residence at Delaford , where , in his evening hours at least , he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty - six and seventeen , brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne 's looks , all the kindness of her welcome , and all the encouragement of her mother 's language , to make it cheerful .
Mrs. Ferrars	"Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken - hearted , at Oxford.-- "" I do think , "" she continued , "" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again ."
Mrs. Ferrars	Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women -- poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility -- and he considered the existence of each , under such a blow , with grateful wonder .
Mrs. Ferrars	Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars ; and even , if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son , his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter , nor be permitted to appear in her presence .
Mrs. Ferrars	"He thus continued : "" Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward 's name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a line has been received from him on the occasion ."
Mrs. Ferrars	Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars 's heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children .
Mrs. Ferrars	""" A letter of proper submission ! "" repeated he ; "" would they have me beg my mother 's pardon for Robert 's ingratitude to HER , and breach of honour to ME?--I can make no submission -- I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy ; but that would not interest.--I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make ."
Mrs. Ferrars	""" "" You may certainly ask to be forgiven , "" said Elinor , "" because you have offended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother 's anger . """
Mrs. Ferrars	"He agreed that he might . "" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first . "" He had nothing to urge against it , but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission ; and therefore , to make it easier to him , as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper , it was resolved that , instead of writing to Fanny , he should go to London , and personally intreat her good offices in his favour.-- "" And if they really DO interest themselves , "" said Marianne , in her new character of candour , "" in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit . "" After a visit on Colonel Brandon 's side of only three or four days , the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to Delaford , that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home , and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it ; and from thence , after staying there a couple of nights , he was to proceed on his journey to town ."
Mrs. Ferrars	After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars , just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring , the reproach of being too amiable , Edward was admitted to her presence , and pronounced to be again her son .
Mrs. Ferrars	Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating .
Mrs. Ferrars	For many years of her life she had had two sons ; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago , had robbed her of one ; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any ; and now , by the resuscitation of Edward , she had one again .
Mrs. Ferrars	In spite of his being allowed once more to live , however , he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure , till he had revealed his present engagement ; for the publication of that circumstance , he feared , might give a sudden turn to his constitution , and carry him off as rapidly as before . With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed , and he was listened to with unexpected calmness . Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood , by every argument in her power;--told him , that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;-- and enforced the assertion , by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE ; but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit -- and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor . What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward 's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny .
Mrs. Ferrars	It was as much , however , as was desired , and more than was expected , by Edward and Elinor ; and Mrs. Ferrars herself , by her shuffling excuses , seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more .
Mrs. Ferrars	Mrs. Jennings 's prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas , and she found in Elinor and her husband , as she really believed , one of the happiest couples in the world .
Mrs. Ferrars	Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed of having authorised ; and even the Dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour .
Mrs. Ferrars	But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them , and always treated them with the make - believe of decent affection , they were never insulted by her real favour and preference .
Mrs. Ferrars	THAT was due to the folly of Robert , and the cunning of his wife ; and it was earned by them before many months had passed away .
Mrs. Ferrars	The selfish sagacity of the latter , which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape , was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it ; for her respectful humility , assiduous attentions , and endless flatteries , as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise , reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice , and re - established him completely in her favour .
Mrs. Ferrars	The whole of Lucy 's behaviour in the affair , and the prosperity which crowned it , therefore , may be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest , an unceasing attention to self - interest , however its progress may be apparently obstructed , will do in securing every advantage of fortune , with no other sacrifice than that of time and conscience .
Mrs. Ferrars	When Robert first sought her acquaintance , and privately visited her in Bartlett 's Buildings , it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother .
Mrs. Ferrars	He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement ; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both , he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter .
Mrs. Ferrars	In that point , however , and that only , he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME , another visit , another conversation , was always wanted to produce this conviction .
Mrs. Ferrars	Some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted , which could only be removed by another half hour 's discourse with himself . His attendance was by this means secured , and the rest followed in course .
Mrs. Ferrars	Instead of talking of Edward , they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other , and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own ; and in short , it became speedily evident to both , that he had entirely supplanted his brother .
Mrs. Ferrars	They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish ; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut -- and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;-- and from thence returning to town , procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars , by the simple expedient of asking it , which , at Lucy 's instigation , was adopted .
Mrs. Ferrars	The forgiveness , at first , indeed , as was reasonable , comprehended only Robert ; and Lucy , who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none , still remained some weeks longer unpardoned .
Mrs. Ferrars	and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with , procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness , and led soon afterwards , by rapid degrees , to the highest state of affection and influence . Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars , as either Robert or Fanny ; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her , and Elinor , though superior to her in fortune and birth , was spoken of as an intruder , SHE was in every thing considered , and always openly acknowledged , to be a favourite child .
Mrs. Ferrars	They settled in town , received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars , were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods ; and setting aside the jealousies and ill - will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy , in which their husbands of course took a part , as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves , nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together .
Mrs. Ferrars	Precious as was the company of her daughter to her , she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend ; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion - house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor . They each felt his sorrows , and their own obligations , and Marianne , by general consent , was to be the reward of all . With such a confederacy against her -- with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness -- with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself , which at last , though long after it was observable to everybody else -- burst on her -- what could she do ?
Mrs. Ferrars	His wife was not always out of humour , nor his home always uncomfortable ; and in his breed of horses and dogs , and in sporting of every kind , he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity . For Marianne , however -- in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss -- he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her , and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;-- and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after - days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon .
Mrs. Ferrars	Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage , without attempting a removal to Delaford ; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , when Marianne was taken from them , Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing , and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover .
Anne Steele	"Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken - hearted , at Oxford.-- "" I do think , "" she continued , "" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again ."
