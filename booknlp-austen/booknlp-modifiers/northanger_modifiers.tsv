Character	Modifier	Context
Catherine Morland	stupid	Not that Catherine was always stupid — by no means ; she learnt the fable of “ The Hare and Many Friends ” as quickly as any girl in England . 
Catherine Morland	sure	Her mother wished her to learn music ; and Catherine was sure she should like it , for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet 
Catherine Morland	Such	Such was Catherine Morland at ten . 
Catherine Morland	delight	Catherine was all eager delight — her eyes were here , there , everywhere , as they approached its fine and striking environs , and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel . 
Catherine Morland	afraid	i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment . 
Catherine Morland	delighted	Catherine was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance , and almost forgot Mr. Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe . 
Catherine Morland	wrong	Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion — but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love , or the duties of friendship , to know when delicate raillery was properly called for , or when a confidence should be forced . 
Catherine Morland	sure	i must tell you , that just after we parted yesterday , I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly — I am sure he is in love with you . ” 
Catherine Morland	sure	I am sure you would be miserable if you thought so ! ” 
Catherine Morland	sure	He asked fifty guineas ; I closed with him directly , threw down the money , and the carriage was mine . ” “ And I am sure , ” said Catherine , “ I know so little of such things that I can not judge whether it was cheap or dear . ” “ Neither one nor t’other ; I might have got it for less , I dare say ; but I hate haggling , and poor Freeman wanted cash . ” “ That was very good - natured of you , ” said Catherine , quite pleased . 
Catherine Morland	fond	Are you fond of an open carriage , Miss Morland ? ” 
Catherine Morland	amazed	i have been scolding him to such a degree , my dear Catherine , you would be quite amazed . 
Catherine Morland	sure	However , I am sure James does not drink so much . 
Catherine Morland	sure	“ Indeed you do me injustice ; I would not have made so improper a remark upon any account ; and besides , I am sure it would never have entered my head . ” 
Catherine Morland	glad	“ I am glad of it , for we shall all be there . ” 
Catherine Morland	sure	This was readily agreed to , with only a proviso of Miss Tilney ’s , that it did not rain , which Catherine was sure it would not . 
Catherine Morland	fool	Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own . ” 
Catherine Morland	sure	“ No , he is not , ” said Catherine warmly , “ for I am sure he could not afford it . ” 
Catherine Morland	disturbed	Catherine was disturbed and out of spirits ; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce , in the fate of which she shared , by private partnership with Morland , a very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton . 
Catherine Morland	easy	I shall not be easy till I have explained everything . ” 
Catherine Morland	miserable	Catherine was restlessly miserable ; she could almost have run round to the box in which he sat and forced him to hear her explanation . 
Catherine Morland	contented	He remained with them some time , and was only too agreeable for Catherine to be contented when he went away . 
Catherine Morland	object	Catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry ; and , while they waited in the lobby for a chair , he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue , by asking , in a consequential manner , whether she had seen him talking with General Tilney : “ He is a fine old fellow , upon my soul ! 
Catherine Morland	sorry	Here Catherine , who was much less gratified by his admiration than by General Tilney ’s , was not sorry to be called away by Mr. Allen . 
Catherine Morland	sorry	Catherine was sorry , but could do no more ; and a short silence ensued , which was broken by Isabella , who in a voice of cold resentment said , “ Very well , then there is an end of the party . 
Catherine Morland	sure	I am sure if I had known it to be improper , I would not have gone with Mr. Thorpe at all ; but I always hoped you would tell me , if you thought I was doing wrong . ” 
Catherine Morland	proud	I am proud when I reflect on it , and I think it must establish me in your good opinion . ” 
Catherine Morland	sure	“ I am sure , ” cried Catherine , “ I did not mean to say anything wrong ; but it _ is _ a nice book , and why should not I call it so ? ” 
Catherine Morland	lost	Here Catherine was quite lost . 
Catherine Morland	well	I think you and I are very well off to be out of the scrape . 
Catherine Morland	unconvinced	Catherine was still unconvinced ; but glad that Anne should have the friendship of an Emily and a Sophia to console her , she bade her adieu without much uneasiness , and returned home , pleased that the party had not been prevented by her refusing to join it , and very heartily wishing that it might be too pleasant to allow either James or Isabella to resent her resistance any longer . 
Catherine Morland	dearer	“ You will be so infinitely dearer to me , my Catherine , than either Anne or Maria : I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland ’s family than to my own . 
Catherine Morland	sorry	“ I am very sorry for it , ” said Catherine dejectedly ; “ if I had known this before — ” “ Perhaps , ” said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner , “ you would be so good — it would make me very happy if — ” The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility , which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding . 
Catherine Morland	aware	With a mind thus full of happiness , Catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away , without her seeing Isabella for more than a few minutes together . 
Catherine Morland	stubborn	But Catherine could be stubborn too ; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home , she joined her and walked out of the pump - room , leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney . 
Catherine Morland	sure	Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable . 
Catherine Morland	sure	“ And are you sure it is my brother ’s doing ? ” “ Yes , very sure . ” 
Catherine Morland	sure	“ And are you sure it is my brother ’s doing ? ” “ Yes , very sure . ” 
Catherine Morland	questioner	“ You are a very close questioner . ” 
Catherine Morland	sure	My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man ; he has had about a week ’s acquaintance with your friend , and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her . ” “ Well , ” said Catherine , after some moments ’ consideration , “ _ you _ may be able to guess at your brother ’s intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not . 
Catherine Morland	mistaken	“ My dear Miss Morland , ” said Henry , “ in this amiable solicitude for your brother ’s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ? 
Catherine Morland	certain	Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . ” Perceiving her still to look doubtful and grave , he added , “ Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us . 
Catherine Morland	motionless	Catherine , for a few moments , was motionless with horror . 
Catherine Morland	only	Catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him . 
Catherine Morland	asleep	“ I have many pamphlets to finish , ” said he to Catherine , “ before I can close my eyes , and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep . 
Catherine Morland	glad	” “ I am very glad of it , ” said Catherine ; “ it would have been very shocking ! ” 
Catherine Morland	friend	let me soon hear from you , dear Catherine ; you are my only friend ; _ your _ love I do build upon . 
Catherine Morland	sure	“ Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . ” 
Catherine Morland	sorry	“ Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . ” 
Catherine Morland	ashamed	Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it , as the General seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country , and the size of the village ; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at , and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage , and at all the little chandler ’s shops which they passed . 
Catherine Morland	delighted	The room in question was of a commodious , well - proportioned size , and handsomely fitted up as a dining - parlour ; and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds , she was shown , first into a smaller apartment , belonging peculiarly to the master of the house , and made unusually tidy on the occasion ; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing - room , with the appearance of which , though unfurnished , Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the General . 
Catherine Morland	dearer	I believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest , for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive . 
Catherine Morland	good	“ You are too good , I am sure , to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform . 
Catherine Morland	sorry	I am very , very sorry we are to part — so soon , and so suddenly too ; but I am not offended , indeed I am not . 
Catherine Morland	nominal	dear , dear Catherine , in being the bearer of such a message , I seem guilty myself of all its insult ; yet , I trust you will acquit me , for you must have been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress of it , that my real power is nothing . ” 
Catherine Morland	safe	Till I know you to be safe at home , I shall not have an hour ’s comfort . 
Catherine Morland	safe	Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at Fullerton , and have found your family well , and then , till I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do , I will not expect more . 
Catherine Morland	wretched	Catherine was too wretched to be fearful . 
Catherine Morland	safe	“ I am sorry for the young people , ” returned Mrs. Morland ; “ they must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General 
Catherine Morland	creature	It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves ; and you know , my dear Catherine , you always were a sad little scatter - brained creature ; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you , with so much changing of chaises and so forth ; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets . 
Catherine Morland	contented	Wherever you are you should always be contented , but especially at home , because there you must spend the most of your time . 
Catherine Morland	sure	” “ I am sure I do not care about the bread . 
Catherine Morland	sure	I will look it out for you some day or other , because I am sure it will do you good . ” 
Catherine Morland	ignorant	Catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all this , than his own children . 
Catherine Morland	tired	Catherine began to feel something of disappointment — she was tired of being continually pressed against by people , the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest , and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a 
Catherine Morland	unacquainted	Catherine began to feel something of disappointment — she was tired of being continually pressed against by people , the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest , and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a 
Catherine Morland	sure	“ I am sure I can not guess at all . ” “ Curricle - hung , you see ; seat , trunk , sword - case , splashing - board , lamps , silver moulding , all you see complete ; the iron - work as good as new , or better . 
Catherine Morland	fond	“ Yes , very ; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one ; but I am particularly fond of it . ” 
Catherine Morland	used	Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways . 
Catherine Morland	to	i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony , however . 
Catherine Morland	sorry	“ And I hope — I hope , Miss Morland , _ you _ will not be sorry to see me . ” 
Catherine Morland	mistaken	“ My dear Miss Morland , ” said Henry , “ in this amiable solicitude for your brother ’s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ? 
Catherine Morland	tired	Having taken her into every division , and led her under every wall , till she was heartily weary of seeing and wondering , he suffered the girls at last to seize the advantage of an outer door , and then expressing his wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the tea - house , proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk , if Miss Morland were not tired . 
Catherine Morland	thankful	She stopped for a moment , and then added , with great firmness , “ I have no sister , you know — and though Henry — though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . ” 
Catherine Morland	glad	After an evening , the little variety and seeming length of which made her peculiarly sensible of Henry ’s importance among them , she was heartily glad to be dismissed ; though it was a look from the General not designed for her observation which sent his daughter to the bell . 
Catherine Morland	certain	Catherine cheerfully complied , and being properly equipped , was more impatient than ever to be at the pump - room , that she might inform herself of General Tilney ’s lodgings , for though she believed they were in Milsom Street , she was not certain of the house , and Mrs. Allen ’s wavering convictions only made it more doubtful . 
Catherine Morland	pleased	Would she be pleased to send up her name ? 
Catherine Morland	angry	She could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility ; but she checked the resentful sensation ; she remembered her own ignorance . 
Catherine Morland	right	She was right ; in a few minutes he appeared , and , making his way through the then thinning rows , spoke with like calm politeness to Mrs. Allen and her friend . 
Catherine Morland	able	The Tilneys called for her at the appointed time ; and no new difficulty arising , no sudden recollection , no unexpected summons , no impertinent intrusion to disconcert their measures , my heroine was most unnaturally able to fulfil her engagement , though it was made with the hero himself . 
Catherine Morland	fearful	Mr. Allen attended her to Milsom Street , where she was to breakfast , and saw her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends ; but so great was her agitation in finding herself as one of the family , and so fearful was she of not doing exactly what was right , and of not being able to preserve their good opinion , 
Catherine Morland	visitor	His anxiety for her comfort — his continual solicitations that she would eat , and his often - expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste — though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on a breakfast - table — made it impossible for her to forget for a moment that she was a visitor . 
Catherine Morland	glad	It was the first time of her being decidedly in his company , and she had hoped to be now able to form her opinion of him ; but she scarcely heard his voice while his father remained in the room ; and even afterwards , so much were his spirits affected , she could distinguish nothing but these words , in a whisper to Eleanor , “ How glad I shall be when you are all off . 
Isabella Thorpe	woman	“ My dear Mrs. Allen , I long to introduce them ; they will be so delighted to see you : the tallest is Isabella , my eldest ; is not she a fine young woman ? 
Isabella Thorpe	handsomest	The others are very much admired too , but I believe Isabella is the handsomest . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man , and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear Catherine , and would therefore shortly return . 
Isabella Thorpe	afraid	I was afraid you were ill . 
Isabella Thorpe	able	so much laughter , that though Catherine ’s supporting opinion was not unfrequently called for by one or the other , she was never able to give 
Isabella Thorpe	glad	how glad I am that I am not amongst them ! 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	I am sure I pity everybody that is . 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	I am sure you do . 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	I am sure John and I should not have minded it . 
Isabella Thorpe	happy	i never was so happy in my life ! 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	She was sure her dearest , sweetest Catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly . 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	But I believe my feelings are stronger than anybody ’s ; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace ; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick , I own . 
Isabella Thorpe	woman	I can not be the only woman . 
Isabella Thorpe	obstinate	“ She is as obstinate as — ” Thorpe never finished the simile , for it could hardly have been a proper one . Away walked Catherine in great agitation , as fast as the crowd would permit her , fearful of being pursued , yet determined to persevere . 
Isabella Thorpe	triumphant	She reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party ; and now that she had been triumphant throughout , had carried her point , and was secure of her walk , she began ( as the flutter of her spirits subsided ) to doubt whether she had been perfectly right . 
Isabella Thorpe	right	She reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party ; and now that she had been triumphant throughout , had carried her point , and was secure of her walk , she began ( as the flutter of her spirits subsided ) to doubt whether she had been perfectly right . 
Isabella Thorpe	insensible	Catherine , relieved for herself , felt uneasy for Isabella , and after a moment ’s thought , asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to Miss Thorpe , and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself ; for she considered that Isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day , in spite of what had passed . 
Isabella Thorpe	guilty	was now an escape indeed ; for what would the Tilneys have thought of her , if she had broken her promise to them in order to do what was wrong in itself , if she had been guilty of one breach of propriety , only to enable her to be guilty of another 
Isabella Thorpe	humble	“ Indeed , Isabella , you are too humble . 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	“ I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not . 
Isabella Thorpe	miserable	“ I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not . 
Isabella Thorpe	satisfied	If I can but be near _ you _ , I shall be satisfied . 
Isabella Thorpe	agreeable	But do not insist upon my being very agreeable , for my heart , you know , will be some forty miles off . 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	” Isabella ’s opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her friend ; she was sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or sister ; and she did not credit there being any pride in their hearts . 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	Catherine , without hesitation , replied that she was very sure Miss Thorpe did not mean to dance at all . 
Isabella Thorpe	aware	But you are not aware of the consequences 
Isabella Thorpe	determined	isabella was so determined not to dance . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	firm	“ You are laughing ; but , I assure you , Isabella is very firm in general . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	Besides , I thought Mrs. Hughes , who introduced him , might take it ill if I did not : and your dear brother , I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening . 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	Amazingly conceited , I am sure . 
Isabella Thorpe	alone	“ But _ that _ you certainly did , for you spent the whole morning in Edgar ’s Buildings — it was the day your father ’s consent came — and I am pretty sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	concerned	I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me — but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side ; I never had the smallest idea of it . 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	I would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours , Isabella , I am sure ; but you know very well that if I could think of one man more than another—_he _ is not the person . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	silent	Isabella was silent . 
Isabella Thorpe	angry	“ My dear friend , you must not be angry with me . 
Isabella Thorpe	sorry	I am sorry for it ; I am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me . 
Isabella Thorpe	sorry	I am sorry for it ; I am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me . 
Isabella Thorpe	sensible	Isabella talked of his attentions ; _ she _ had never been sensible of any ; but Isabella had said many things which she hoped had been spoken in haste , and 
Isabella Thorpe	glad	would never be said again ; and upon this she was glad to rest altogether for present ease and comfort . 
Isabella Thorpe	concerned	For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned . 
Isabella Thorpe	wrong	Catherine blushed for her friend , and said , “ Isabella is wrong . 
Isabella Thorpe	scrupulous	But Isabella had promised and promised again ; and when she promised a thing , she was so scrupulous in performing it ! 
Isabella Thorpe	fortunate	The very painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality , which , as she was given to understand by his words as well as his actions , she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the General ; and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money , 
Isabella Thorpe	sorry	i am very sorry for it ; but really I thought I was in very good time . 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	I am sure I have been here this half hour . 
Isabella Thorpe	afraid	In the first place , I was so afraid it would rain this morning , just as I wanted to set off ; it looked very showery , and that would have thrown me into agonies ! 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	I know it must be a skeleton , I am sure it is Laurentina ’s skeleton . 
Isabella Thorpe	glad	how glad I am ! 
Isabella Thorpe	nature	I have no notion of loving people by halves ; it is not my nature . 
Isabella Thorpe	sure	my dear Isabella , I am sure there must be Laurentina ’s skeleton behind it . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	uneasy	In a few moments Catherine , with unaffected pleasure , assured her that she need not be longer uneasy , as the gentlemen had just left the pump - room . 
Isabella Thorpe	glad	“ Well , I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them ! 
Isabella Thorpe	afraid	My dearest Catherine , I quite envy you ; but I am afraid , brother , 
Isabella Thorpe	kind	“ I am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you . 
Isabella Thorpe	girl	She is a most amiable girl ; such a superior understanding ! 
Isabella Thorpe	understanding	She is a most amiable girl ; such a superior understanding ! 
Isabella Thorpe	constant	Now she has really got the man she likes , she may be constant . ” 
Isabella Thorpe	constant	“ Indeed I am afraid she will , ” replied Henry ; “ I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick ’s only chance . 
Henry Tilney	afraid	“ And pray , sir , what do you think of Miss Morland ’s gown ? ” “ It is very pretty , madam , ” said he , gravely examining it ; “ but I do not think it will wash well ; I am afraid it will fray . ” 
Henry Tilney	polite	Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said ; and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced . 
Henry Tilney	clergyman	How proper Mr. Tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr. Allen ’s head , but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied ; for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was , and had been assured of Mr. Tilney ’s being a clergyman , and of a very respectable family in Gloucestershire 
Henry Tilney	absent	was to be seen in the room at different periods of the fashionable hours ; crowds of people were every moment passing in and out , up the steps and down ; people whom nobody cared about , and nobody wanted to see ; and he only was absent . 
Henry Tilney	fonder	Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump - room . 
Henry Tilney	happy	“ I am very happy to see you again , sir , indeed ; I was afraid you had left Bath . ” 
Henry Tilney	afraid	“ I am very happy to see you again , sir , indeed ; I was afraid you had left Bath . ” 
Henry Tilney	man	Upon recollection , however , I have a notion they are both dead ; at least the mother is ; yes , I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead , because Mrs. Hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter on her wedding - day and that Miss Tilney has got now , for they were put by for her when her mother died . ” “ And is Mr. Tilney , my partner , the only son ? ” “ I can not be quite positive about that , my dear ; I have some idea he is ; but , however , he is a very fine young man , Mrs. Hughes says , and likely to do very well . 
Henry Tilney	wild	mr . Tilney , I have been quite wild to speak to you , and make my apologies . 
Henry Tilney	generous	Catherine ’s mind was greatly eased by this information , yet a something of solicitude remained , from which sprang the following question , thoroughly artless in itself , though rather distressing to the gentleman : “ But , Mr. Tilney , why were _ you _ less generous than your sister ? 
Henry Tilney	ready	If she felt such confidence in my good intentions , and could suppose it to be only a mistake , why should _ you _ be so ready to take offence ? ” 
Henry Tilney	sure	“ Nay , I am sure by your look , when you came into the box , you were angry . ” 
Henry Tilney	angry	“ Nay , I am sure by your look , when you came into the box , you were angry . ” 
Henry Tilney	girl	I had entered on my studies at Oxford , while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home ! ” “ Not very good , I am afraid . 
Henry Tilney	impertinent	“ Henry , ” said Miss Tilney , “ you are very impertinent . 
Henry Tilney	ladies	“ Very true , ” said Henry , “ and this is a very nice day , and we are taking a very nice walk , and you are two very nice young ladies . 
Henry Tilney	nice	You are more nice than wise . 
Henry Tilney	fond	You are fond of that kind of reading ? 
Henry Tilney	fond	“ You are fond of history ! and so are Mr. Allen and my father ; and I 
Henry Tilney	noble	No — I will be noble . 
Henry Tilney	agreeable	That he was perfectly agreeable and good - natured , and altogether a very charming man , did not admit of a doubt , for he was tall and handsome , and Henry ’s father . 
Henry Tilney	tall	That he was perfectly agreeable and good - natured , and altogether a very charming man , did not admit of a doubt , for he was tall and handsome , and Henry ’s father . 
Henry Tilney	handsome	That he was perfectly agreeable and good - natured , and altogether a very charming man , did not admit of a doubt , for he was tall and handsome , and Henry ’s father . 
Henry Tilney	father	That he was perfectly agreeable and good - natured , and altogether a very charming man , did not admit of a doubt , for he was tall and handsome , and Henry ’s father . 
Henry Tilney	afraid	“ No , no ; it shall not do either ; I am not afraid . ” 
Henry Tilney	sure	Henry smiled and said , “ I am sure my brother would not wish to do that . ” 
Henry Tilney	sorry	“ I am always sorry to leave Eleanor . ” 
Henry Tilney	sure	but this will not happen to me , I am sure . 
Henry Tilney	sure	I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy . 
Henry Tilney	alone	Henry was alone in it ; and his immediate 
Henry Tilney	great	She stopped for a moment , and then added , with great firmness , “ I have no sister , you know — and though Henry — though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . ” 
Henry Tilney	afraid	I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs . 
Henry Tilney	aware	Catherine had never wanted comfort more , and he looked as if he was aware of it . 
Henry Tilney	sorry	“ I am sorry , ” said Henry , closing the book he had just opened ; “ if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome , I should have given it with very different feelings . ” 
Henry Tilney	quick	“ How quick you are ! ” cried Catherine : “ you have guessed it , I declare ! 
Henry Tilney	afraid	“ Indeed I am afraid she will , ” replied Henry ; “ I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick ’s only chance . 
Henry Tilney	afraid	“ Indeed I am afraid she will , ” replied Henry ; “ I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick ’s only chance . 
Henry Tilney	sure	“ I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your 
Henry Tilney	particular	That he was very particular in his eating , she had , by her own unassisted observation , already discovered ; but why he should say one thing so positively , and mean another all the while , was most unaccountable ! 
Henry Tilney	aware	Who but Henry could have been aware of what his father was at ? 
Henry Tilney	able	Henry was not able to obey his father ’s injunction of remaining wholly at Northanger in attendance on the ladies , during his absence in London , the engagements of his curate at Woodston obliging him to leave them on Saturday for a couple of nights . 
Henry Tilney	privy	Henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained ; and equally safe did she believe her secret with each . 
Henry Tilney	agreeable	Mr. Tilney drank tea with us , and I always thought him a great addition , he is so very agreeable . 
Henry Tilney	able	, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually increasing ; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the moment , by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland ’s preferment , trebling his private fortune , bestowing a rich aunt , and sinking half the children , he was able to represent the whole family to the General in a most respectable light . 
Henry Tilney	as	Henry , in having such things to relate of his father , was almost as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself . 
Henry Tilney	fool	The circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a man of fortune and consequence , which took place in the course of the summer — an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour , from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his forgiveness of Henry , and his permission for him “ to be a fool if he liked it ! ” 
General Tilney	sure	But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies , I am sure your father , Miss Morland , would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment . 
General Tilney	man	“ He is a happy man ! ” said the General , with a look of very happy contempt . 
General Tilney	cheerful	He excused himself , however , from attending them : “ The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him , and he would meet them by another course . ” 
General Tilney	happy	Soon after her death I obtained it for my own , and hung it in my bed - chamber — where I shall be happy to show it you ; it is very like . ” Here was another proof . 
General Tilney	cruel	he must have been dreadfully cruel to her ! 
General Tilney	able	That the General , having erected such a monument , should be able to face it , was not perhaps very strange , and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view , maintain so elevated an air , look so fearlessly around , nay , that he should even enter the church , seemed wonderful to Catherine . 
General Tilney	free	The General , meanwhile , though offended every morning by Frederick ’s remissness in writing , was free from any real anxiety about him , and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland ’s time at Northanger pass pleasantly . 
General Tilney	furious	The General was furious in his anger , and they parted in dreadful disagreement . 
General Tilney	afraid	almost afraid of him 
General Tilney	sanguine	“ I will write home directly , ” said she , “ and if they do not object , as I dare say they will not — ” General Tilney was not less sanguine , having already waited on her excellent friends in Pulteney Street , and obtained their sanction of his wishes . 
General Tilney	man	Why he had done it , what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality , and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will , was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as Catherine herself ; but it did not oppress them by any means so long ; and , after a due course of useless conjecture , that “ it was a strange business , and that he must be a very strange man , ” grew enough for all their indignation and wonder ; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility , exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour . 
General Tilney	odd	Very unfriendly , certainly ; and he must be a very odd man ; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again ! 
John Thorpe	glad	“ I am glad of it ; I will drive you out in mine every day . ” 
John Thorpe	fellow	“ He is as good - natured a fellow as ever lived ; a little of a rattle ; but that will recommend him to your sex , I believe : and how do you like the rest of the family ? ” 
John Thorpe	tired	“ He was with us just now , and said he was so tired of lounging about , that he was resolved to go and dance ; so I thought perhaps he would ask you , if he met with you . ” “ Where can he be ? ” said Catherine , looking round ; but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance . 
John Thorpe	young	after a short silence , she added , “ he is a very agreeable young man . ” “ Indeed he is , Mrs. Allen , ” said Mrs. Thorpe , smiling complacently ; “ I must say it , though I _ am _ his mother , that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world . ” This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many ; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen , for after only a moment ’s consideration , she said , in a whisper to Catherine , “ I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son . ” Catherine was disappointed and vexed . 
John Thorpe	tired	“ Oh , no ; I am much obliged to you , our two dances are over ; and , besides , I am tired , and do not mean to dance any more . ” 
John Thorpe	disagreeable	Could she have foreseen such a circumstance , nothing should have persuaded her to go out with the others ; and , as it was , she could only lament her ill luck , and think over what she had lost , till it was clear to her that the drive had by no means been very pleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite disagreeable . 
John Thorpe	same	I never mind going through anything , where a friend is concerned ; that is my disposition , and John is just the same ; he has amazing strong feelings . 
John Thorpe	skulker	John himself was no skulker in joy . 
John Thorpe	late	“ Shall not you be late at Devizes ? ” said Catherine . 
John Thorpe	sure	“ I am sure I think it a very good one . ” 
John Thorpe	glad	i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony , however . 
John Thorpe	sorry	There are very few people I am sorry to see . 
John Thorpe	glad	And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same . 
John Thorpe	sure	I am sure of a good income of my own ; and if she had not a penny , why , so much the better . 
John Thorpe	alone	“ But _ that _ you certainly did , for you spent the whole morning in Edgar ’s Buildings — it was the day your father ’s consent came — and I am pretty sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house . ” 
John Thorpe	full	He is full of spirits , playful as can be , but there is no vice in him . 
John Thorpe	agreeable	Little as Catherine was in the habit of judging for herself , and unfixed as were her general notions of what men ought to be , she could not entirely repress a doubt , while she bore with the effusions of his endless conceit , of his being altogether completely agreeable . 
John Thorpe	brother	It was a bold surmise , for he was Isabella ’s brother ; and she had been assured by James that his manners would recommend him to all her sex ; but in spite of this , the extreme weariness of his company , which crept over her before they had been out an hour , and which continued unceasingly to increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again , induced her , in some small degree , to resist such high authority , and to distrust his powers of giving universal pleasure . 
John Thorpe	friend	“ Mr. Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother ’s , that if he talks to me , I must talk to him again ; but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that I have any acquaintance with . ” 
John Thorpe	vexed	you do not know how vexed I am ; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton , nor in anything else . 
John Thorpe	fellow	Catherine was the immediate object of his gallantry ; and , while they waited in the lobby for a chair , he prevented the inquiry which had travelled from her heart almost to the tip of her tongue , by asking , in a consequential manner , whether she had seen him talking with General Tilney : “ He is a fine old fellow , upon my soul ! 
James Morland	angry	Even James was quite angry . 
James Morland	patron	A living , of which Mr. Morland was himself patron and incumbent , of about four hundred pounds yearly value , was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it ; no trifling deduction from the family income , no niggardly assignment to one of ten children . 
James Morland	incumbent	A living , of which Mr. Morland was himself patron and incumbent , of about four hundred pounds yearly value , was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it ; no trifling deduction from the family income , no niggardly assignment to one of ten children . 
James Morland	old	A living , of which Mr. Morland was himself patron and incumbent , of about four hundred pounds yearly value , was to be resigned to his son as soon as he should be old enough to take it ; no trifling deduction from the family income , no niggardly assignment to one of ten children . 
James Morland	man	If he finds he _ can _ do more by and by , I dare say he will , for I am sure he must be an excellent good - hearted man . 
James Morland	man	I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ” 
James Morland	man	I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ” 
James Morland	sufferer	James was the sufferer . 
James Morland	unhappy	poor James is so unhappy ! 
James Morland	man	Just at present it comes hard to poor James ; but that will not last forever ; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life , for the foolishness of his first choice . 
Eleanor Tilney	ready	Eleanor was ready to oblige her ; and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise , their first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed - chamber . 
Eleanor Tilney	glad	In such considerations time passed away , and it was certainly in his favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him , and have so much to say , for half an hour was almost gone since his arrival , and Eleanor did not come up . At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery , and listened for its continuance ; but all was silent . 
Eleanor Tilney	sure	“ You are too good , I am sure , to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform . 
Eleanor Tilney	sure	“ No , Eleanor , if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me , I am sure I had better not write . 
Eleanor Tilney	angry	“ Oh , do not say Miss Tilney was not angry , ” cried Catherine , “ because I know she was ; for she would not see me this morning when I called ; I saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it ; I was hurt , but I was not affronted . 
Eleanor Tilney	glad	“ I am very glad to hear it indeed , and now I shall never be ashamed of liking Udolpho myself . 
Eleanor Tilney	ashamed	“ I am very glad to hear it indeed , and now I shall never be ashamed of liking Udolpho myself . 
Eleanor Tilney	afraid	I had entered on my studies at Oxford , while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home ! ” “ Not very good , I am afraid . 
Eleanor Tilney	fond	I am fond of history — and am very well contented to take the false with the true . 
Eleanor Tilney	happy	” “ I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them . ” 
Eleanor Tilney	earnest	Miss Tilney was earnest , though gentle , in her secondary civilities , and the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary reference to Fullerton would allow . 
Eleanor Tilney	right	Tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections , and I believe he is very right . 
Eleanor Tilney	anxious	There was yet another point which Miss Tilney was anxious to settle , though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of . 
Mrs. Thorpe	widow	Mrs. Thorpe was a widow , and not a very rich one ; she was a good - humoured , well - meaning woman , and a very indulgent mother . 
Mrs. Thorpe	one	Mrs. Thorpe was a widow , and not a very rich one ; she was a good - humoured , well - meaning woman , and a very indulgent mother . 
Mrs. Thorpe	woman	Mrs. Thorpe was a widow , and not a very rich one ; she was a good - humoured , well - meaning woman , and a very indulgent mother . 
Mrs. Thorpe	mother	Mrs. Thorpe was a widow , and not a very rich one ; she was a good - humoured , well - meaning woman , and a very indulgent mother . 
Mrs. Thorpe	glad	They were changed into , “ How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe ! ” and she was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two families , as her young charge and Isabella themselves could be ; never satisfied with the day unless she spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe , in what they called conversation , but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of opinion , and not often any resemblance of subject , for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her children , and Mrs. Allen of her gowns .

Mrs. Thorpe	glad	“ I am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you . 
Mrs. Thorpe	sure	“ I beg your pardon , Miss Morland , ” said she , “ for this liberty — but I can not anyhow get to Miss Thorpe , and Mrs. Thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you . ” 
Mrs. Thorpe	glad	“ I am glad of it . 
Mrs. Thorpe	pleased	“ So Mrs. Thorpe said ; she was vastly pleased at your all going . ” 
Mrs. Thorpe	indulgent	Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt ; but , however , you had better not interfere . 
Mrs. Thorpe	sure	If he finds he _ can _ do more by and by , I dare say he will , for I am sure he must be an excellent good - hearted man . 
Mrs. Thorpe	sure	I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ” 
Mrs. Thorpe	sure	“ Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do , I am sure . 
Frederick Tilney	jealous	He might be jealous of her brother as a rival , but if more had seemed implied , the fault must have been in her misapprehension . 
Frederick Tilney	safe	Is he safe only in solitude ? 
Frederick Tilney	man	Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected . 
Frederick Tilney	deceased	he is a deceased man — defunct in understanding . 
Frederick Tilney	last	Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine , as I wore it the week before at the Concert , but made wretched work of it — it happened to become my odd face , I believe , at least Tilney told me so at the time , and said every eye was upon me ; but he is the last man whose word I would take . 
Frederick Tilney	man	Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine , as I wore it the week before at the Concert , but made wretched work of it — it happened to become my odd face , I believe , at least Tilney told me so at the time , and said every eye was upon me ; but he is the last man whose word I would take . 
Frederick Tilney	ashamed	She trusted he would never speak of Miss Thorpe ; and indeed , as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had acted 
Mrs. Allen	afraid	Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it , I am afraid . ” 
Mrs. Allen	sure	But , dear Mrs. Allen , are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people ? 
Mrs. Allen	satisfied	Mrs. Allen was now quite happy — quite satisfied with Bath . 
Mrs. Allen	sure	I tell Mr. Allen , when he talks of being sick of it , that I am sure he should not complain , for it is so very agreeable a place , that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year . 
Mrs. Allen	inattentive	Mrs. Allen was not inattentive to it : “ Well , my dear , ” said she , “ suppose you go . ” 
Mrs. Morland	woman	Mrs. Morland was a very good woman , and wished to see her children everything they ought to be ; but her time was so much occupied in lying - in and teaching the little ones , that her elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves ; and it was not very wonderful that Catherine , who had by nature nothing heroic about her , should prefer cricket , baseball , riding on horseback , and running about the country at the age of fourteen , to books — or at least books of information — for , provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them , provided they were all story and no reflection , she had never any objection to books at all . 
Mrs. Morland	choice	The air of a gentlewoman , a great deal of quiet , inactive good temper , and a trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible , intelligent man like Mr. Allen . 
Mrs. Morland	sorry	“ I am sorry for the young people , ” returned Mrs. Morland ; “ they must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General 
Mrs. Morland	sorry	I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella . 
Mrs. Morland	happy	Mrs. Morland was not happy in her attempt at consolation . 
Mrs. Morland	creature	and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . ” Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable resentment of a sensible friend ; and Mrs. Allen thought his expressions quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself . 
Mrs. Morland	disposed	Far from comprehending him or his sister in their father ’s misconduct , Mrs. Morland had been always kindly disposed towards each , and instantly , pleased by his appearance , received him with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence ; thanking him for such an attention to her daughter , assuring him that the friends of her children were always welcome there , and entreating him to say not another word of the past . 
Mr. Allen	comfort	You must be a great comfort to your sister , sir . ” 
Mr. Allen	glad	At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen , who , on hearing the reason of their speedy return , said , “ I am glad your brother had so much sense ; I am glad you are come back . 
Mr. Allen	glad	At the head of them she was met by Mr. Allen , who , on hearing the reason of their speedy return , said , “ I am glad your brother had so much sense ; I am glad you are come back . 
Mr. Allen	glad	“ No , certainly not ; and I am glad you do not think of it . 
Mr. Allen	glad	I am glad you do not think of going ; I am sure Mrs. Morland would not be pleased . 
Mr. Allen	sure	I am glad you do not think of going ; I am sure Mrs. Morland would not be pleased . 
Mr. Allen	rich	A silence of several minutes succeeded their first short dialogue ; it was broken by Thorpe ’s saying very abruptly , “ Old Allen is as rich as a Jew — is not he ? ” 
Mr. Allen	rich	Yes , I believe , he is very rich . ” 
Mr. Allen	godfather	He is _ your _ godfather , is not he ? ” 
Mr. Allen	gouty	He seems a good kind of old fellow enough , and has lived very well in his time , I dare say ; he is not gouty for nothing .
