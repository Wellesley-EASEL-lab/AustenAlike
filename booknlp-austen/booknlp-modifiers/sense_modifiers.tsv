Elinor Dashwood	sensible	She was sensible and clever ; but eager in everything : her sorrows , her joys , could have no moderation . 
Elinor Dashwood	clever	She was sensible and clever ; but eager in everything : her sorrows , her joys , could have no moderation . 
Elinor Dashwood	eager	She was sensible and clever ; but eager in everything : her sorrows , her joys , could have no moderation . 
Elinor Dashwood	interesting	She was generous , amiable , interesting : she was everything but prudent . 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	"Indeed , I think I may say that you can not , for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial , and if THAT were your opinion , I am sure you could never be civil to him . "" "
Elinor Dashwood	sure	""" I am sure , "" replied Elinor , with a smile , "" that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that . "
Elinor Dashwood	mistaken	What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank . 
Elinor Dashwood	secure	She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness , and her acceptance of his proposal ; and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters , that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent . Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland , than immediately amongst their present acquaintance . 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	"A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them . "" She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton ; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection . "
Elinor Dashwood	dejected	When is she dejected or melancholy ? 
Elinor Dashwood	melancholy	When is she dejected or melancholy ? 
Elinor Dashwood	capable	I should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend . 
Elinor Dashwood	able	""" "" You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , "" replied Elinor , "" and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid . "
Elinor Dashwood	afraid	"I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . "" "" I am afraid , "" replied Elinor , "" that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . "" "" On the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , Elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did , I should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure . "
Elinor Dashwood	sure	""" "" No , I can not think that . He must and does love her I am sure . "
Elinor Dashwood	last	"I know Marianne 's heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible . I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct . "" Elinor thought this generosity overstrained , considering her sister 's youth , and urged the matter farther , but in vain ; common sense , common care , common prudence , were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood 's romantic delicacy . "
Elinor Dashwood	vexed	Elinor took no notice of this ; and directing her attention to their visitor , endeavoured to support something like discourse with him , by talking of their present residence , its conveniences , & c. extorting from him occasional questions and remarks . His coldness and reserve mortified her severely ; she was vexed and half angry ; but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present , she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure , and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection . CHAPTER 17 Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him ; for his coming to Barton was , in her opinion , of all things the most natural . 
Elinor Dashwood	angry	Elinor took no notice of this ; and directing her attention to their visitor , endeavoured to support something like discourse with him , by talking of their present residence , its conveniences , & c. extorting from him occasional questions and remarks .

CHAPTER 17 Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him ; for his coming to Barton was , in her opinion , of all things the most natural . 
Elinor Dashwood	right	""" But gaiety never was a part of MY character . "" "" Nor do I think it a part of Marianne 's , "" said Elinor ; "" I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest , very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry . "" "" I believe you are right , "" he replied , "" and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl . "" "
Elinor Dashwood	guilty	I am guilty , I confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ? 
Elinor Dashwood	conscious	That the hair was her own , she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne ; the only difference in their conclusions was , that what Marianne considered as a free gift from her sister , Elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself . 
Elinor Dashwood	disposed	He valued their kindness beyond any thing , and his greatest happiness was in being with them . Yet , he must leave them at the end of a week , in spite of their wishes and his own , and without any restraint on his time . Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother 's account ; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her , as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son . Disappointed , however , and vexed as she was , and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself , she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications , which had been rather more painfully extorted from her , for Willoughby 's service , by her mother . His want of spirits , of openness , and of consistency , were most usually attributed to his want of independence , and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars 's disposition and designs . The shortness of his visit , the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them , originated in the same fettered inclination , the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother . The old well - established grievance of duty against will , parent against child , was the cause of all . 
Elinor Dashwood	certain	"You may see her if you look this way . "" As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes , without taking that liberty , she begged to be excused . "
Elinor Dashwood	glad	""" Well -- I am so glad you do . "
Elinor Dashwood	eager	She thought it probable that as they lived in the same county , Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some more particular account of Willoughby 's general character , than could be gathered from the Middletons ' partial acquaintance with him ; and she was eager to gain from any one , such a confirmation of his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne . 
Elinor Dashwood	glad	"I know why you inquire about him , very well ; your sister is to marry him . I am monstrous glad of it , for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know . "" "" Upon my word , "" replied Elinor , "" you know much more of the matter than I do , if you have any reason to expect such a match . "" "" Do n't pretend to deny it , because you know it is what every body talks of . "
Elinor Dashwood	sure	However , I do n't think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night . 
Elinor Dashwood	glad	""" I am so glad we are got acquainted at last , "" continued Charlotte.--""And now I hope we shall always be great friends . "
Elinor Dashwood	glad	And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married ! 
Elinor Dashwood	sorry	""" I am sorry I do NOT , "" said Elinor , in great astonishment , "" if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her . "
Elinor Dashwood	surprised	But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family , and therefore I am a little surprised , I confess , at so serious an inquiry into her character . 
Elinor Dashwood	surprised	""" You may well be surprised , "" continued Lucy ; "" for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before ; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family ; because it was always meant to be a great secret , and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour . "
Elinor Dashwood	unwilling	I was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but I was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so well as me , Miss Dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him . 
Elinor Dashwood	young	I was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but I was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so well as me , Miss Dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him . 
Elinor Dashwood	afraid	""" I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you , "" said she , "" in telling you all this . "
Elinor Dashwood	unfortunate	Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward 's mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask . 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day , when Edward 's name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all . 
Elinor Dashwood	alive	I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward 's sake these last four years . 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke . 
Elinor Dashwood	confounded	She was mortified , shocked , confounded . 
Elinor Dashwood	likely	One or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private , when Sir John called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles . Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother 's permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise . 
Elinor Dashwood	kind	""" You are very kind , "" said Lady Middleton to Elinor ; "" and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ? "" "
Elinor Dashwood	pleased	""" You are very kind , "" said Lady Middleton to Elinor ; "" and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ? "" "
Elinor Dashwood	undeserving	""" I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with , if I felt no desire for its continuance , or no farther curiosity on its subject . "
Elinor Dashwood	angry	I felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs . 
Elinor Dashwood	careful	""" Lucy here looked up ; but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenance from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency . "
Elinor Dashwood	happy	""" I should always be happy , "" replied Elinor , "" to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ? "
Elinor Dashwood	afraid	"Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town , but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival ; and at length , by way of saying something , she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last . "" Yes , "" he replied , with some embarrassment , "" almost ever since ; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to Barton . "
Elinor Dashwood	fearful	This , and the manner in which it was said , immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place , with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings , and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt . Mrs. Jennings soon came in . 
Elinor Dashwood	uncomfortable	""" But if she DID , the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact . Whatever the truth of it might be , and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it , yet while she saw Marianne in spirits , she could not be very uncomfortable herself . And Marianne was in spirits ; happy in the mildness of the weather , and still happier in her expectation of a frost . "
Elinor Dashwood	willing	Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan , and excepting a few old city friends , whom , to Lady Middleton 's regret , she had never dropped , she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions . Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected , Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties , which , whether at home or abroad , formed only for cards , could have little to amuse her . 
Elinor Dashwood	bent	""" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . "" Marianne said no more , but looked exceedingly hurt . Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister 's relief , Elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother , and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne , to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed ; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow , that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby , for she could not suppose it to be to any other person . About the middle of the day , Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on business , and Elinor began her letter directly , while Marianne , too restless for employment , too anxious for conversation , walked from one window to the other , or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation . "
Elinor Dashwood	earnest	Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother , relating all that had passed , her suspicions of Willoughby 's inconstancy , urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him . Her letter was scarcely finished , when a rap foretold a visitor , and Colonel Brandon was announced . 
Elinor Dashwood	able	She was not immediately able to say anything , and even when her spirits were recovered , she debated for a short time , on the answer it would be most proper to give . 
Elinor Dashwood	liable	The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known to herself , that in endeavouring to explain it , she might be as liable to say too much as too little . 
Elinor Dashwood	astonishment	Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever-- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings 's chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed . 
Elinor Dashwood	able	"A glass of wine , which Elinor procured for her directly , made her more comfortable , and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness , by saying , "" Poor Elinor ! how unhappy I make you ! "" "
Elinor Dashwood	happy	"if you knew!--And can you believe me to be so , while I see you so wretched ! "" "" Forgive me , forgive me , "" throwing her arms round her sister 's neck ; "" I know you feel for me ; I know what a heart you have ; but yet you are -- you must be happy ; Edward loves you -- what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ? "" "" Many , many circumstances , "" said Elinor , solemnly . "
Elinor Dashwood	pained	""" I have been more pained , "" said she , "" by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier . "
Elinor Dashwood	sure	""" I have been more pained , "" said she , "" by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier . "
Elinor Dashwood	desirous	She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself , as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over , as she was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers , which she saw her eagerly examining every morning . 
Elinor Dashwood	sorry	Elinor only was sorry to see them . 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	""" But I always thought I SHOULD . I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you TOLD me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a MONTH . But I thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point . It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came . And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone . I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD . "" Elinor perfectly understood her , and was forced to use all her self - command to make it appear that she did NOT . "
Elinor Dashwood	glad	""" But I always thought I SHOULD . I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you TOLD me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a MONTH .

"" Elinor perfectly understood her , and was forced to use all her self - command to make it appear that she did NOT . "
Elinor Dashwood	sure	""" Indeed I believe you , "" replied Elinor ; "" but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME . "
Elinor Dashwood	mistaken	""" You are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken . "
Elinor Dashwood	pleased	Elinor was pleased that he had called ; and still more pleased that she had missed him . 
Elinor Dashwood	ELINOR	She wondered that Lucy 's spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was NOT ELINOR , appear a compliment to herself -- or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her , because her real situation was unknown . 
Elinor Dashwood	happy	But that it was so , had not only been declared by Lucy 's eyes at the time , but was declared over again the next morning more openly , for at her particular desire , Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone , to tell her how happy she was . 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	I am sure it will all end well , and there will be no difficulties at all , to what I used to think . 
Elinor Dashwood	anxious	But Elinor had more to do ; and so anxious was she , for his sake and her own , to do it well , that she forced herself , after a moment 's recollection , to welcome him , with a look and manner that were almost easy , and almost open ; and another struggle , another effort still improved them . 
Elinor Dashwood	happy	She would not allow the presence of Lucy , nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself , to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him , and that she had very much regretted being from home , when he called before in Berkeley Street . She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which , as a friend and almost a relation , were his due , by the observant eyes of Lucy , though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her . 
Elinor Dashwood	well	Elinor is well , you see . 
Elinor Dashwood	angry	"Elinor was very angry , but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting ; for she calmly replied , "" Not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street . "
Elinor Dashwood	musical	The party , like other musical parties , comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance , and a great many more who had none at all ; and the performers themselves were , as usual , in their own estimation , and that of their immediate friends , the first private performers in England . As Elinor was neither musical , nor affecting to be so , she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte , whenever it suited her , and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp , and violoncello , would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room . In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of young men , the very he , who had given them a lecture on toothpick - cases at Gray 's . She perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself , and speaking familiarly to her brother ; and had just determined to find out his name from the latter , when they both came towards her , and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars . 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	And so , just as he was going away again , it came into my head , I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it , but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news . 
Elinor Dashwood	glad	Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ) , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There 's for you , my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ) , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There 's for you , my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a - year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . Lord ! 
Elinor Dashwood	able	"how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . "" Here Mrs. Jennings ceased , and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce . Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it ; that Mrs. Jennings ( as she had of late often hoped might be the case ) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward ; and happy above all the rest , in the absence of Marianne , she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment , and to give her judgment , as she believed , with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it . "
Elinor Dashwood	anxious	What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do , though there could not be a doubt of its nature , she was anxious to hear ; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself . 
Elinor Dashwood	anxious	What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do , though there could not be a doubt of its nature , she was anxious to hear ; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself . 
Elinor Dashwood	glad	But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others was dear to me , I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt . Now , I can think and speak of it with little emotion . 
Elinor Dashwood	conscious	I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own , I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther . 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	I wish him very happy ; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty , that though now he may harbour some regret , in the end he must become so . 
Elinor Dashwood	unhappy	"The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that I have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;-- they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No , Marianne.--THEN , if I had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely -- not even what I owed to my dearest friends -- from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy . ""-- Marianne was quite subdued.-- "" Oh ! "
Elinor Dashwood	sorry	An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they entered the Gardens , and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them , and engaging all Mrs. Jennings 's conversation , she was herself left to quiet reflection . 
Elinor Dashwood	sorry	I am sorry I did not know it before ; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself . 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	I know they will ; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.-- ' La ! ' 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother 's anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and 
Elinor Dashwood	anxious	Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal , and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately , as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey , which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge . She began , however , seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment , and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess , who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good - will , when a plan was suggested , which , though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer , appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other . 
Elinor Dashwood	grateful	"Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother 's concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;-- and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton . "" Ah ! "
Elinor Dashwood	glad	It was an office in short , from which , unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER , she would have been very glad to be spared herself;-- but Colonel Brandon , on motives of equal delicacy , declining it likewise , still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means , that she would not on any account make farther opposition . 
Elinor Dashwood	astonished	I never was more astonished in my life . 
Elinor Dashwood	glad	I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress . 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	But whether she would do for a lady 's maid , I am sure I ca n't tell . 
Elinor Dashwood	sure	"Colonel Brandon , who was here only ten minutes ago , has desired me to say , that understanding you mean to take orders , he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant , and only wishes it were more valuable . Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well - judging a friend , and to join in his wish that the living -- it is about two hundred a - year -- were much more considerable , and such as might better enable you to -- as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself -- such , in short , as might establish all your views of happiness . "" What Edward felt , as he could not say it himself , it can not be expected that any one else should say for him . He LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected , such unthought - of information could not fail of exciting ; but he said only these two words , "" Colonel Brandon ! "" "" Yes , "" continued Elinor , gathering more resolution , as some of the worst was over , "" Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed -- for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you -- a concern which I am sure Marianne , myself , and all your friends , must share ; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character , and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion . "
Elinor Dashwood	sure	""" Fanny is in her own room , I suppose , "" said he:--""I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it , indeed . "
Elinor Dashwood	silent	"Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world . "" Elinor was silent . "
Elinor Dashwood	glad	"Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately ? "" Elinor had heard enough , if not to gratify her vanity , and raise her self - importance , to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself , and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother , by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars . "
Elinor Dashwood	ready	But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister 's composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against Marianne inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm . A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings 's advice , of sending for the Palmers ' apothecary . 
Elinor Dashwood	cheerfulness	Elinor , confirmed in every pleasant hope , was all cheerfulness ; rejoicing that in her letters to her mother , she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend 's , in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland ; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel . 
Elinor Dashwood	cheerful	Marianne was in every respect materially better , and he declared her entirely out of danger . Mrs. Jennings , perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm , allowed herself to trust in his judgment , and admitted , with unfeigned joy , and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness , the probability of an entire recovery . Elinor could not be cheerful . Her joy was of a different kind , and led to any thing rather than to gaiety . 
Elinor Dashwood	rascal	I mean to offer some kind of explanation , some kind of apology , for the past ; to open my whole heart to you , and by convincing you , that though I have been always a blockhead , I have not been always a rascal , to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma -- from your sister . 
Elinor Dashwood	glad	talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , ' I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married . 
Elinor Dashwood	determined	I sent no answer to Marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street;--but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , I watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name . 
Elinor Dashwood	ashamed	"And , in short -- what do you think of my wife 's style of letter - writing?--delicate -- tender-- truly feminine -- was it not ? "" "" Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand - writing . "" "" Yes , but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to . "
Elinor Dashwood	inclined	"And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two . "" Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so , because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age , characters , or feelings , could be given;--but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject , and therefore instead of an inquiry , she passed it off with a smile . "" "
Elinor Dashwood	ready	"To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him?--Did you allow him to hope ? "" "" Oh ! "
Elinor Dashwood	afraid	"Elinor looked as if she wished to hear more . "" Did you see them off , before you came away ? "" "" No , ma'am -- the horses were just coming out , but I could not bide any longer ; I was afraid of being late . "" "" Did Mrs. Ferrars look well ? "" "" Yes , ma'am , she said how she was very well ; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady -- and she seemed vastly contented . "" Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question , and Thomas and the tablecloth , now alike needless , were soon afterwards dismissed . "
Elinor Dashwood	mistress	"I WILL be calm ; I WILL be mistress of myself . "" In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake . She saw her mother and Marianne change colour ; saw them look at herself , and whisper a few sentences to each other . "
Elinor Dashwood	every	Comparisons would occur -- regrets would arise;--and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language . But Elinor -- how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil .

"
Elinor Dashwood	simple	I was simple enough to think , that because my FAITH was plighted to another , there could be no danger in my being with you ; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour . 
Elinor Dashwood	wrong	After that , I suppose , I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex , and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it , were no better than 
Elinor Dashwood	artful	You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful . 
Elinor Dashwood	aware	Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever-- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy . She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment ; then read it again and again ; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man , and so bitter were her feelings against him , that she dared not trust herself to speak , lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement , not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils , a connection , for life , with an unprincipled man , as a deliverance the most real , a blessing the most important . In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings 's chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one . Determined not to quit Marianne , though hopeless of contributing , at present , to her ease , she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings , on account of her sister being indisposed . 
Elinor Dashwood	glad	I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother 's anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and 
Elinor Dashwood	modest	my dear , you are very modest . 
Elinor Dashwood	urgent	Her departure , therefore , was fixed on ; and within an hour after Mr. Harris 's arrival , she set off , with her little boy and his nurse , for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer 's , who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath ; whither her husband promised , at her earnest entreaty , to join her in a day or two ; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her . Mrs. Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use . Poor Marianne , languid and low from the nature of her malady , and feeling herself universally ill , could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered ; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced , but for this unlucky illness , made every ailment severe ; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home ; and , attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings , were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon . The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one . The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient ; she certainly was not better , and , except that there was no amendment , did not appear worse . Their party was now farther reduced ; for Mr. Palmer , though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good - nature , as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife , was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her ; and while he was preparing to go , Colonel Brandon himself , with a much greater exertion , began to talk of going likewise.--Here , however , the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably ; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister 's account , would be to deprive them both , she thought , of every comfort ; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself , that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening , while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister , & c. 
Elinor Dashwood	calm	But he judged it unnecessary : he had still something more to try , some more fresh application , of whose success he was as confident as the last , and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear , but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood . She was calm , except when she thought of her mother ; but she was almost hopeless ; and in this state she continued till noon , scarcely stirring from her sister 's bed , her thoughts wandering from one image of grief , one suffering friend to another , and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings , who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne 's disappointment had brought on .

Elinor Dashwood	daughter	In spite of his being allowed once more to live , however , he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure , till he had revealed his present engagement ; for the publication of that circumstance , he feared , might give a sudden turn to his constitution , and carry him off as rapidly as before . With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed , and he was listened to with unexpected calmness . Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood , by every argument in her power;--told him , that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;-- and enforced the assertion , by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE ; but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit -- and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor . What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward 's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny .

Marianne Dashwood	afraid	Marianne was afraid of offending , and said no more on the subject ; but the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the drawings of other people , was very far from that rapturous delight , which , in her opinion , could alone be called taste .

Marianne Dashwood	faithful	"She was faithful to her word ; and when Willoughby called at the cottage , the same day , Elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice , on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present . The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related , and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible . His concern however was very apparent ; and after expressing it with earnestness , he added , in the same low voice,--""But , Marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . I shall keep it only till you can claim it . "

Marianne Dashwood	awake	She was awake the whole night , and she wept the greatest part of it . She got up with a headache , was unable to talk , and unwilling to take any nourishment ; giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters , and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either .

I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while .

Marianne Dashwood	desirous	"It should not , must not be a struggle . "" Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare them perfectly well ; and Elinor , who now understood her sister , and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again , made no farther direct opposition to the plan , and merely referred it to her mother 's decision , from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit , which she could not approve of for Marianne , and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid . Whatever Marianne was desirous of , her mother would be eager to promote -- she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust ; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London . That Marianne , fastidious as she was , thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings ' manners , and invariably disgusted by them , should overlook every inconvenience of that kind , should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings , in her pursuit of one object , was such a proof , so strong , so full , of the importance of that object to her , as Elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness .

Marianne Dashwood	sure	"I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . "" Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person , to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness ; and resolved within herself , that if her sister persisted in going , she would go likewise , as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment , or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours . To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy 's account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished . "" I will have you BOTH go , "" said Mrs. Dashwood ; "" these objections are nonsensical . "

And Marianne was in spirits ; happy in the mildness of the weather , and still happier in her expectation of a frost . "

"" With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself ; and to persuade her to check her agitation , to wait , at least , with the appearance of composure , till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect , was impossible ; for Marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings , by exclamations of wretchedness . In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase , and telling Marianne that he was gone , urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening , as a fresh argument for her to be calm . She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home , as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer . "
Marianne Dashwood	unwell	Lady Middleton , though in the middle of a rubber , on being informed that Marianne was unwell , was too polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away , and making over her cards to a friend , they departed as soon the carriage could be found . 
Marianne Dashwood	creature	"Elinor , who saw as plainly by this , as if she had seen the direction , that it must come from Willoughby , felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head , and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jenning 's notice . That good lady , however , saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking . Of Elinor 's distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as Marianne disappeared , she said , "" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature . "

Marianne Dashwood	conscious	When there , though looking most wretchedly , she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected . Had she tried to speak , or had she been conscious of half Mrs. Jennings 's well - meant but ill - judged attentions to her , this calmness could not have been maintained ; but not a syllable escaped her lips ; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her . 
Marianne Dashwood	unhappy	Their good friend saw that Marianne was unhappy , and felt that every thing was due to her which might make her at all less so . She treated her therefore , with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its holidays .

Marianne Dashwood	sure	It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world . 
Marianne Dashwood	able	Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment , on this impertinent examination of their features , and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick - cases presented to his inspection , by remaining unconscious of it all ; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself , and be as ignorant of what was passing around her , in Mr. Gray 's shop , as in her own bedroom .

Having now said enough to make his poverty clear , and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear - rings for each of his sisters , in his next visit at Gray 's his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn , and he began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings . "" "
Marianne Dashwood	person	"Marianne looked at her steadily , and said , "" You know , Elinor , that this is a kind of talking which I can not bear . If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted , as I must suppose to be the case , you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it . I can not descend to be tricked out of assurances , that are not really wanted . "
Marianne Dashwood	sure	"Nothing escaped HER minute observation and general curiosity ; she saw every thing , and asked every thing ; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of Marianne 's dress ; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself , and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted , how much her washing cost per week , and how much she had every year to spend upon herself . The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies , moreover , was generally concluded with a compliment , which though meant as its douceur , was considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all ; for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown , the colour of her shoes , and the arrangement of her hair , she was almost sure of being told that upon "" her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests . "" With such encouragement as this , was she dismissed on the present occasion , to her brother 's carriage ; which they were ready to enter five minutes after it stopped at the door , a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister - in - law , who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance , and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman .

Marianne Dashwood	reverse	""" What!--while attending me in all my misery , has this been on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!""-- "" It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse ! "" "
Marianne Dashwood	subdued.--	"The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that I have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;-- they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No , Marianne.--THEN , if I had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely -- not even what I owed to my dearest friends -- from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy . ""-- Marianne was quite subdued.-- "" Oh ! "
Marianne Dashwood	sorry	I am sorry to say , ma'am , in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother 's notice . He left her house yesterday , but where he is gone , or whether he is still in town , I do not know ; for WE of course can make no inquiry . 
Marianne Dashwood	pleased	she left no creature behind , from whom it would give her a moment 's regret to be divided for ever , she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of Lucy 's friendship , she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage , and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring Marianne 's peace of mind , and confirming her own . Their journey was safely performed . 
Marianne Dashwood	grateful	she left no creature behind , from whom it would give her a moment 's regret to be divided for ever , she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of Lucy 's friendship , she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage , and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring Marianne 's peace of mind , and confirming her own . Their journey was safely performed . 
Marianne Dashwood	better	Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time ; to every inquiry replied that she was better , and tried to prove herself so , by engaging in her accustomary employments . 
Marianne Dashwood	unable	But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand , which she was unable to read , or in lying , weary and languid , on a sofa , did not speak much in favour of her amendment ; and when , at last , she went early to bed , more and more indisposed , Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister 's composure , who , though attending and nursing her the whole day , against Marianne inclination , and forcing proper medicines on her at night , trusted , like Marianne , to the certainty and efficacy of sleep , and felt no real alarm . A very restless and feverish night , however , disappointed the expectation of both ; and when Marianne , after persisting in rising , confessed herself unable to sit up , and returned voluntarily to her bed , Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings 's advice , of sending for the Palmers ' apothecary . 
Marianne Dashwood	able	Elinor , confirmed in every pleasant hope , was all cheerfulness ; rejoicing that in her letters to her mother , she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend 's , in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland ; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel . 
Marianne Dashwood	better	Marianne was in every respect materially better , and he declared her entirely out of danger . Mrs. Jennings , perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm , allowed herself to trust in his judgment , and admitted , with unfeigned joy , and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness , the probability of an entire recovery . Elinor could not be cheerful . Her joy was of a different kind , and led to any thing rather than to gaiety . 
Marianne Dashwood	constant	""" Marianne 's note , by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse . "
Marianne Dashwood	married	talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , ' I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married . 
Marianne Dashwood	dearer	I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that I was using her infamously . But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me . 
Marianne Dashwood	sure	Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever . 
Marianne Dashwood	happy	"To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him?--Did you allow him to hope ? "" "" Oh ! "
Marianne Dashwood	happy	"Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness -- often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other . I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be with Colonel Brandon . "" She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree with her , but her dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence . "
Marianne Dashwood	impatient	CHAPTER 46 Marianne 's illness , though weakening in its kind , had not been long enough to make her recovery slow ; and with youth , natural strength , and her mother 's presence in aid , it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove , within four days after the arrival of the latter , into Mrs. Palmer 's dressing - room . When there , at her own particular request , for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother , Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her . 
Marianne Dashwood	days	Marianne had been two or three days at home , before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out . 
Marianne Dashwood	thankful	"Her voice sunk with the word , but presently reviving she added , "" I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject , Elinor?""-- hesitatingly it was said.--""Or will it be "
Marianne Dashwood	insolent	To the Middletons , to the Palmers , the Steeles , to every common acquaintance even , I had been insolent and unjust ; with a heart hardened against their merits , and a temper irritated by their very attention.--To John , to Fanny,--yes , even to them , little as they deserve , I had given less than their due . 
Marianne Dashwood	unjust	To the Middletons , to the Palmers , the Steeles , to every common acquaintance even , I had been insolent and unjust ; with a heart hardened against their merits , and a temper irritated by their very attention.--To John , to Fanny,--yes , even to them , little as they deserve , I had given less than their due . 
Marianne Dashwood	capable	I have laid down my plan , and if I am capable of adhering to it -- my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved . They shall no longer worry others , nor torture myself . 
Marianne Dashwood	tired	Elinor , dreading her being tired , led her towards home ; and till they reached the door of the cottage , easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it , talked of nothing but Willoughby , and their conversation together ; and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look , where minuteness could be safely indulged . 
Marianne Dashwood	happy	I never could have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later I must have known , all this.--I should have had no confidence , no esteem . 
Marianne Dashwood	poor	Had you married , you must have been always poor . 
Marianne Dashwood	better	By that time , Marianne was rather better , 
Marianne Dashwood	wretched	I care not who knows that I am wretched . 
Marianne Dashwood	miserable	But to appear happy when I am so miserable -- Oh ! 
Edward Ferrars	son	Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest , for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich ; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence , for , except a trifling sum , the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother . 
Edward Ferrars	handsome	He was not handsome , and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing . 
Edward Ferrars	diffident	He was too diffident to do justice to himself ; but when his natural shyness was overcome , his behaviour gave every indication of an open , affectionate heart . 
Edward Ferrars	amiable	Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly . 
Edward Ferrars	kind	But yet -- he is not the kind of young man -- there is something wanting -- his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . 
Edward Ferrars	deficient	He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . 
Edward Ferrars	unwilling	Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well . He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right . 
Edward Ferrars	aware	What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank . 
Edward Ferrars	well	I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well . 
Edward Ferrars	person	He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby ; the only one who could have gained a smile from her ; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM , and in her sister 's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment . He dismounted , and giving his horse to his servant , walked back with them to Barton , whither he was purposely coming to visit them . 
Edward Ferrars	confused	On Edward 's side , more particularly , there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion . He was confused , seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them , looked neither rapturous nor gay , said little but what was forced from him by questions , and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection . 
Edward Ferrars	saucy	Forgive me , if I am very saucy . 
Edward Ferrars	willing	"But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old disputes . "" "" I love to be reminded of the past , Edward -- whether it be melancholy or gay , I love to recall it -- and you will never offend me by talking of former times . "
Edward Ferrars	right	You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent -- some of it , at least -- my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books . 
Edward Ferrars	gay	"You are not very gay yourself . "" "" Why should you think so ! "" replied he , with a sigh . "
Edward Ferrars	able	""" "" You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility , "" said Edward to Elinor , "" Do you gain no ground ? "
Edward Ferrars	afraid	""" My judgment , "" he returned , "" is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister 's . "

Edward Ferrars	Reserved!--how	""" Reserved!--how , in what manner ? What am I to tell you ? "
Edward Ferrars	unhappy	It was evident that he was unhappy ; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring ; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain ; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one . 
Edward Ferrars	ready	""" I am going into the village to see my horses , "" said be , "" as you are not yet ready for breakfast ; I shall be back again presently . "" "
Edward Ferrars	fastidious	He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own . 
Edward Ferrars	fond	I am not fond of nettles or thistles , or heath blossoms . 
Edward Ferrars	grave	She was not in a humour , however , to regard it as an affront , and affecting to take no notice of what passed , by instantly talking of something else , she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself , beyond all doubt , that it was exactly the shade of her own . Edward 's embarrassment lasted some time , and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled . He was particularly grave the whole morning . 
Edward Ferrars	man	"But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward 's affection , to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton , and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger . "" I think , Edward , "" said Mrs. Dashwood , as they were at breakfast the last morning , "" you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions .

Edward Ferrars	old	As for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it -- and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing .

Edward Ferrars	brother	"He is brother to Mrs. John Dashwood -- THAT must be recommendation enough to her husband . "" "
Edward Ferrars	weary	Elinor was soon called to the card - table by the conclusion of the first rubber , and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end , to which both of them submitted without any reluctance , for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before ; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife ; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage , which sincere affection on HER side would have given , for self - interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement , of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary . From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor , and when entered on by Lucy , who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it , and was particularly careful to inform her confidante , of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward , it was treated by the former with calmness and caution , and dismissed as soon as civility would allow ; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which Lucy did not deserve , and which were dangerous to herself . 
Edward Ferrars	unworthy	""" No , he is not so unworthy as you believe him . "
Edward Ferrars	first	"Edward was the first to speak , and it was to notice Marianne 's altered looks , and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her . "" Oh , do n't think of me !

Edward Ferrars	unwilling	In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge . 
Edward Ferrars	welcome	he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him . 
Edward Ferrars	man	I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street , and am much pleased with him . He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , I wish it still more .

Edward Ferrars	son	"Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son . "" "" You surprise me ; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time . "" "
Edward Ferrars	clergyman	The idea of Edward 's being a clergyman , and living in a small parsonage - house , diverted him beyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice , and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown , he could conceive nothing more ridiculous . Elinor , while she waited in silence and immovable gravity , the conclusion of such folly , could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited . It was a look , however , very well bestowed , for it relieved her own feelings , and gave no intelligence to him . He was recalled from wit to wisdom , not by any reproof of her 's , but by his own sensibility . 
Edward Ferrars	sorry	I am extremely sorry for it-- for I know him to be a very good - hearted creature ; as well - meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world . 
Edward Ferrars	creature	I am extremely sorry for it-- for I know him to be a very good - hearted creature ; as well - meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world . 
Edward Ferrars	shocked	Poor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!-- to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul , I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom ; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life , as when it all burst forth . 
Edward Ferrars	surprised	That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society!--but , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected . 
Edward Ferrars	free	CHAPTER 49 Unaccountable , however , as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family , it was certain that Edward was free ; and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre - determined by all;--for 
Edward Ferrars	free	Comparisons would occur -- regrets would arise;--and her joy , though sincere as her love for her sister , was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language . But Elinor -- how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil . 
Edward Ferrars	unfortunate	Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women -- poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility -- and he considered the existence of each , under such a blow , with grateful wonder . 
Edward Ferrars	son	In spite of his being allowed once more to live , however , he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure , till he had revealed his present engagement ; for the publication of that circumstance , he feared , might give a sudden turn to his constitution , and carry him off as rapidly as before . With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed , and he was listened to with unexpected calmness . Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood , by every argument in her power;--told him , that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;-- and enforced the assertion , by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds , while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE ; but when she found that , though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation , he was by no means inclined to be guided by it , she judged it wisest , from the experience of the past , to submit -- and therefore , after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity , and as served to prevent every suspicion of good - will , she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor . What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward 's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny . 
Edward Ferrars	ashamed	Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed of having authorised ; and even the Dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour . 
John Willoughby	sort	""" And what sort of a young man is he ? "
John Willoughby	fellow	""" Upon my soul , "" said he , "" I do not know much about him as to all THAT . But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw . "
John Willoughby	worth	"On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence ; and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the country ; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court , to whom he was related , and whose possessions he was to inherit ; adding , "" Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . "
John Willoughby	man	I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . 
John Willoughby	sort	""" "" He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived , "" repeated Sir John . "
John Willoughby	fond	But when this passed away , when her spirits became collected , when she saw that to the perfect good - breeding of the gentleman , he united frankness and vivacity , and above all , when she heard him declare , that of music and dancing he was passionately fond , she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay . 
John Willoughby	young	Willoughby was a young man of good abilities , quick imagination , lively spirits , and open , affectionate manners . 
John Willoughby	faultless	In Mrs. Dashwood 's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne 's ; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity , in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister , of saying too much what he thought on every occasion , without attention to persons or circumstances . In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people , in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged , and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety 
John Willoughby	man	Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments , which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man ,

John Willoughby	rich	I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable , and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down , and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage . 
John Willoughby	unable	"Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted , where they found only Willoughby , who was leaning against the mantel - piece with his back towards them . He turned round on their coming in , and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over - powered Marianne . "" Is anything the matter with her ? "" cried Mrs. Dashwood as she entered--""is she ill ? "" "" I hope not , "" he replied , trying to look cheerful ; and with a forced smile presently added , "" It is I who may rather expect to be ill -- for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment ! "" "" Disappointment ? "" "" Yes , for I am unable to keep my engagement with you . Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin , by sending me on business to London . I have just received my dispatches , and taken my farewell of Allenham ; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you . "" "" To London!--and are you going this morning ?

John Willoughby	welcome	""" I have only to add , my dear Willoughby , that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for I will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith ; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination .

John Willoughby	heart	""" Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton , Elinor , "" said she , as she sat down to work , "" and with how heavy a heart does he travel ? "
John Willoughby	aware	I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him , ) and on that account is eager to get him away;-- and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him . This is what I believe to have happened . He is , moreover , aware that she DOES disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from Devonshire for a while . You will tell me , I know , that this may or may NOT have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this . 
John Willoughby	little	It may be proper to conceal their engagement ( if they ARE engaged ) from Mrs. Smith-- and if that is the case , it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present . But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us . 
John Willoughby	man	It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect . But why ? Is he not a man of honour and feeling ? 
John Willoughby	deceitful	can he be deceitful ? 
John Willoughby	stranger	Though WE have not known him long , he is no stranger in this part of the world ; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage ? 
John Willoughby	little	He is very little at Combe , I believe ; but if he were ever so much there , I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him , for he is in the opposition , you know , and besides it is such a way off .

John Willoughby	lucky	She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her . 
John Willoughby	afraid	""" It can not be generally known , "" returned Elinor , "" for her own family do not know it . "" He looked surprised and said , "" I beg your pardon , I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of .

John Willoughby	intimate	""" By many -- by some of whom you know nothing , by others with whom you are most intimate , Mrs. Jennings , Mrs. Palmer , and the Middletons . "
John Willoughby	weary	That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt , and that Willoughby was weary of it , seemed equally clear ; for however Marianne might still feed her own wishes , SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or misapprehension of any kind . Nothing but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it . 
John Willoughby	unfathomable	Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable ! 
John Willoughby	capable	"In that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation . "" "" It may be so ; but Willoughby is capable -- at least I think""--he stopped a moment ; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself , "" And your sister-- how did she-- "" "" Her sufferings have been very severe . I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short . "
John Willoughby	deceitful	He has been very deceitful ! 
John Willoughby	unfortunate	Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself , and at others , lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him .

John Willoughby	much	"Careless of her happiness , thinking only of my own amusement , giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging , I endeavoured , by every means in my power , to make myself pleasing to her , without any design of returning her affection . "" Miss Dashwood , at this point , turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt , stopped him , by saying , "" It is hardly worth while , Mr. Willoughby , for you to relate , or for me to listen any longer . Such a beginning as this can not be followed by any thing.-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject . "" "
John Willoughby	libertine	I do not mean to justify myself , but at the same time can not leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge -- that because she was injured she was irreproachable , and because I was a libertine , SHE must be a saint .

Lucy Steele	sorry	"A short pause succeeded this speech , which was first broken by Miss Steele , who seemed very much disposed for conversation , and who now said rather abruptly , "" And how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex . "" "
Lucy Steele	sure	""" "" But why should you think , "" said Lucy , looking ashamed of her sister , "" that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex ? "" "" Nay , my dear , I 'm sure I do n't pretend to say that there an't . "
Lucy Steele	sure	I 'm sure there 's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter ; but you know , how could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland ; and I was only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton , if they had not so many as they used to have .

Lucy Steele	clever	CHAPTER 22 Marianne , who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence , vulgarity , inferiority of parts , or even difference of taste from herself , was at this time particularly ill - disposed , from the state of her spirits , to be pleased with the Miss Steeles , or to encourage their advances ; and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them , which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side , Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both , but especially of Lucy , who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation , or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments . Lucy was naturally clever ; her remarks were often just and amusing ; and as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable ; but her powers had received no aid from education : she was ignorant and illiterate ; and her deficiency of all mental improvement , her want of information in the most common particulars , could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood , in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage .

Lucy Steele	surprised	But if I dared tell you all , you would not be so much surprised . 
Lucy Steele	sure	""" You may well be surprised , "" continued Lucy ; "" for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before ; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family ; because it was always meant to be a great secret , and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour . "
Lucy Steele	likely	Ferrars , the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars , of Park Street , and brother of your sister - in - law , Mrs. John Dashwood , is the person I mean ; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends . 
Lucy Steele	able	""" I have never been able , "" continued Lucy , "" to give him my picture in return , which I am very much vexed at , for he has been always so anxious to get it ! "
Lucy Steele	sure	""" I am sure , "" said she , "" I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say . "
Lucy Steele	acquaintance	I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance . 
Lucy Steele	afraid	"He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple , to go to you , that I was afraid you would think him quite ill . "" "" Did he come from your uncle 's , then , when he visited us ? "
Lucy Steele	able	And so well was she able to answer her own expectations , that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes , no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters , that Elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love , and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man , of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed , and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house . 
Lucy Steele	stronger	The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne , what had been entrusted in confidence to herself , though it obliged her to unceasing exertion , was no aggravation of Elinor 's distress . On the contrary it was a relief to her , to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them , and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward , which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself , and which was more than she felt equal to support . From their counsel , or their conversation , she knew she could receive no assistance , their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress , while her self - command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise . She was stronger alone , and her own good sense so well supported her , that her firmness was as unshaken , her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable , as with regrets so poignant and so fresh , it was possible for them to be . 
Lucy Steele	interested	She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again , she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward , whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him , and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy , by her readiness to enter on the matter again , and her calmness in conversing on it , that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend , which she very much feared her involuntary agitation , in their morning discourse , must have left at least doubtful . That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable : it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise , not merely from Lucy 's assertion , but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance , with a secret so confessedly and evidently important . And even Sir John 's joking intelligence must have had some weight . But indeed , while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward , it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous ; and

Lucy Steele	glad	"But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me .

"" "
Lucy Steele	unpardonable	""" Edward 's love for me , "" said Lucy , "" has been pretty well put to the test , by our long , very long absence since we were first engaged , and it has stood the trial so well , that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now . "
Lucy Steele	inclined	""" I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature , and from our different situations in life , from his being so much more in the world than me , and our continual separation , I was enough inclined for suspicion , to have found out the truth in an instant , if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met , or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for , or if he had talked more of one lady than another , or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be . "
Lucy Steele	sure	"I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick - sighted in general , but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived . "" "" All this , "" thought Elinor , "" is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us . "" "" But what , "" said she after a short silence , "" are your views ? "
Lucy Steele	creature	""" I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood 's is not , "" said Mrs. Jennings , laughing heartily ; "" for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who SHE likes . "
Lucy Steele	first	"It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person . "" "" ' Tis because you are an indifferent person , "" said Lucy , with some pique , and laying a particular stress on those words , "" that your judgment might justly have such weight with me . If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having . "" Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this , lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve ; and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again . Another pause therefore of many minutes ' duration , succeeded this speech , and Lucy was still the first to end it . "
Lucy Steele	sorry	"I am sorry we can not see your sister , Miss Dashwood , "" said Miss Steele . "
Lucy Steele	sorry	""" I am sorry she is not well-- "" for Marianne had left the room on their arrival . "
Lucy Steele	sure	"but such old friends as Lucy and me!--I think she might see US ; and I am sure we would not speak a word . "" "
Lucy Steele	elegant	So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton , so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her , that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant , and her sister not even genteel , she was as ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street ; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles , as soon as the Dashwoods ' invitation was known , that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place . 
Lucy Steele	distinguished	Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.-- A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly ; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars ' power to distress her by it now;-- and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles , a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more , only amused her . She could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person-- for Lucy was particularly distinguished -- whom of all others , had they known as much as she did , they would have been most anxious to mortify ; while she herself , who had comparatively no power to wound them , sat pointedly slighted by both . But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied , she could not reflect on the mean - spirited folly from which it sprung , nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance , without thoroughly despising them all four . Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished ; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy . The dinner was a grand one , the servants were numerous , and every thing bespoke the Mistress 's inclination for show , and the Master 's ability to support it . In spite of the improvements and additions which were making to the Norland estate , and in spite of its owner having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss , nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;-- no poverty of any kind , except of conversation , appeared-- but there , the deficiency was considerable .

Lucy Steele	sure	I am sure I should have seen it in a moment , if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me . 
Lucy Steele	proud	It checked the idleness of one , and the business of the other . Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them , and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of and administer at other times , she feared they would despise her for offering . 
Lucy Steele	kind	But so little were they , anymore than the others , inclined to oblige her , that if Sir John dined from home , she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject , than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself . 
Lucy Steele	bad	The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad . 
Lucy Steele	cousin	"I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . "" "
Lucy Steele	glad	""" I am so glad to meet you ; "" said Miss Steele , taking her familiarly by the arm--""for I wanted to see you of all things in the world . "" "
Lucy Steele	glad	And it was entirely for HER sake , and upon HER account , that he said a word about being off , and not upon his own . I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her , or of wishing to marry Miss Morton , or any thing like it . But , to be sure , Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking ; so she told him directly ( with a great deal about sweet and love , you know , and all that -- Oh , la ! one ca n't repeat such kind of things you know)--she told him directly , she had not the least mind in the world to be off , for she could live with him upon a trifle , and how little so ever he might have , she should be very glad to have it all , you know , or something of the kind . So then he was monstrous happy , and talked on some time about what they should do , and they agreed he should take orders directly , and they must wait to be married till he got a living . 
Lucy Steele	happy	I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . I suppose Lady Middleton wo n't ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here .

Lucy Steele	able	"I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there . "" Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more . CHAPTER 41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett 's Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life . "
Lucy Steele	ready	As for Colonel Brandon , she was not only ready to worship him as a saint , but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns ; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost ; and scarcely resolved to avail herself , at Delaford , as far as she possibly could , of his servants , his carriage , his cows , and his poultry .

Lucy Steele	lady	She was always a very affable and free - spoken young lady , and very civil behaved . 
Lucy Steele	pretty	But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen . I had therefore nothing in the world to do , but to fancy myself in love ; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable , as I had no friend , no companion in my brother , and disliked new acquaintance , it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple , where I always felt myself at home , and was always sure of a welcome ; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen : Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging . She was pretty too -- at least I thought so THEN ; and I had seen so little of other women , that I could make no comparisons , and see no defects . 
Lucy Steele	worse	Robert 's offence was unpardonable , but Lucy 's was infinitely worse . 
Mrs. Jennings	full	Luckily Lady Middleton 's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . The young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . Mrs. Jennings , Lady Middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . She was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . Marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs. Jennings 's . Colonel Brandon , the friend of Sir John , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than Lady Middleton was to be his wife , or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton 's mother . He was silent and grave . 
Mrs. Jennings	widow	She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel 's advanced state of life which humanity required . CHAPTER 8 Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure . 
Mrs. Jennings	active	In the promotion of this object she was zealously active , as far as her ability reached ; and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance . 
Mrs. Jennings	quick	She was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments , and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man ; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood . 
Mrs. Jennings	anxious	Mrs. Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married , ever since her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge ; and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl .

Mrs. Jennings	afraid	""" I am afraid , none at all . "" "
Mrs. Jennings	wonderer	CHAPTER 14 The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon 's visit at the park , with his steadiness in concealing its cause , filled the mind , and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days ; she was a great wonderer , as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance . She wondered , with little intermission what could be the reason of it ; was sure there must be some bad news , and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him , with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all . 
Mrs. Jennings	sure	""" Something very melancholy must be the matter , I am sure , "" said she . "
Mrs. Jennings	afraid	I am afraid his circumstances may be bad . 
Mrs. Jennings	desirous	Elinor , though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon , could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away , which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling ; for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation , her wonder was otherwise disposed of . 
Mrs. Jennings	nice	"It was several days before Willoughby 's name was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family ; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , indeed , were not so nice ; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;-- but one evening , Mrs. Dashwood , accidentally taking up a volume of Shakespeare , exclaimed , "" We have never finished Hamlet , Marianne ; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it . "
Mrs. Jennings	sure	I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I 've quite set my heart upon it . 
Mrs. Jennings	sure	I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I do n't get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault . 
Mrs. Jennings	sure	""" "" Nay , "" cried Mrs. Jennings , "" I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne 's company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back .

Mrs. Jennings	glad	"Colonel , "" said she , with her usual noisy cheerfulness , "" I am monstrous glad to see you -- sorry I could not come before -- beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with-- Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner !

Mrs. Jennings	young	I was young once , but I never was very handsome -- worse luck for me .

Mrs. Jennings	ready	Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was . 
Mrs. Jennings	sure	I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like , I would send all over the town for it . 
Mrs. Jennings	sure	"With a letter in her outstretched hand , and countenance gaily smiling , from the persuasion of bringing comfort , she entered their room , saying , "" Now , my dear , I bring you something that I am sure will do you good . "" "
Mrs. Jennings	calm	But the letter , when she was calm enough to read it , brought little comfort . 
Mrs. Jennings	woman	I understand she is a woman of very good fortune . 
Mrs. Jennings	able	"Few people of common prudence will do THAT ; and whatever she saves , she will be able to dispose of . "" "
Mrs. Jennings	widow	Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with . 
Mrs. Jennings	sure	""" "" Poor young man ! "" cried Mrs. Jennings , "" I am sure "
Mrs. Jennings	warm	, he went away ; leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion , as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars 's conduct , the Dashwoods ' , and Edward 's . Marianne 's indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room ; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor , and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings , they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party . CHAPTER 38 Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward 's conduct , but only Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit . 
Mrs. Jennings	angry	"Is she angry ? "" "" Not at all , I believe , with you . "" "" That is a good thing . "
Mrs. Jennings	happy	I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . I suppose Lady Middleton wo n't ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here . 
Mrs. Jennings	eager	As soon as they returned to the carriage , Mrs. Jennings was eager for information ; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that Lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known . 
Mrs. Jennings	honorable	""" Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes , by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui , to provoke him to make that offer , which might give himself an escape from it;-- and if so , she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained ; for , on Elinor 's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print , which she was going to copy for her friend , he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning , and conversed with her there for several minutes . The effect of his discourse on the lady too , could not escape her observation , for though she was too honorable to listen , and had even changed her seat , on purpose that she might NOT hear , to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing , she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour , attended with agitation , and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes , in the interval of Marianne 's turning from one lesson to another , some words of the Colonel 's inevitably reached her ear , in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house . "
Mrs. Jennings	ready	"Astonished and shocked at so unlover - like a speech , she was almost ready to cry out , "" Lord ! what should hinder it?""--but checking her desire , confined herself to this silent ejaculation . "" This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older . "" "
Mrs. Jennings	pleased	And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life , and I wish you joy of it with all my heart . 
Mrs. Jennings	glad	Ay , to be sure , he must be ordained in readiness ; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you . 
Mrs. Jennings	right	Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said . I have something of consequence to inform you of , which I was on the point of communicating by paper . 
Mrs. Jennings	alive	""" "" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living 's being enough to allow them to marry .

Mrs. Jennings	sure	"I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there . "" Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more . CHAPTER 41 Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett 's Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life . "
Mrs. Jennings	sure	"Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken - hearted , at Oxford.-- "" I do think , "" she continued , "" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again .

"
Mrs. Jennings	able	Mrs. Jennings 's prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas , and she found in Elinor and her husband , as she really believed , one of the happiest couples in the world . 
Mrs. Dashwood	caricature	But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;-- more narrow - minded and selfish . 
Mrs. Dashwood	stout	and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty . 
Mrs. Dashwood	healthy	and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty . 
Mrs. Dashwood	impatient	Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland ; 
Mrs. Dashwood	indefatigable	Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland ; 
Mrs. Dashwood	rapid	No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter . For the comfort of her children , had she consulted only her own wishes , she would have kept it ; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed . 
Mrs. Dashwood	resolute	Their visitors , except those from Barton Park , were not many ; for , in spite of Sir John 's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood , and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service , the independence of Mrs. Dashwood 's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children ; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk . There were but few who could be so classed ; and it was not all of them that were attainable . About a mile and a half from the cottage , along the narrow winding valley of Allenham , which issued from that of Barton , as formerly described , the girls had , in one of their earliest walks , discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which , by reminding them a little of Norland , interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it . 
Mrs. Dashwood	glad	I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . 
Mrs. Dashwood	kind	"But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from us long I hope . "" He coloured as he replied , "" You are very kind , but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately . "
Mrs. Dashwood	welcome	Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome ? 
Mrs. Dashwood	good	"For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ? "" His colour increased ; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied , "" You are too good . "" "
Mrs. Dashwood	astonished	Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak , and another pause succeeded . 
Mrs. Dashwood	sorry	Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said ; but it gave Elinor pleasure , as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions . 
Mrs. Dashwood	surprised	Elinor took no notice of this ; and directing her attention to their visitor , endeavoured to support something like discourse with him , by talking of their present residence , its conveniences , & c. extorting from him occasional questions and remarks . His coldness and reserve mortified her severely ; she was vexed and half angry ; but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present , she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure , and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection . CHAPTER 17 Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him ; for his coming to Barton was , in her opinion , of all things the most natural . 
Mrs. Dashwood	anxious	Your mother will secure to you , in time , that independence you are so anxious for ; it is her duty , and it will , it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent . 
Mrs. Dashwood	safe	From all danger of seeing Willoughby again , her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country , since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends . 
Mrs. Dashwood	pleased	Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life , as she was with them ; had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant ; called Lucy by her Christian name ; and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them . [ At this point in the first and second edtions , Volume II ended .

Mrs. Dashwood	calm	Elinor 's delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;-- but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her . Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night ; and Elinor , 
Mrs. Dashwood	sure	""" His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , I am sure it must be a good one . "" "
Mrs. Dashwood	prudent	Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage , without attempting a removal to Delaford ; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , when Marianne was taken from them , Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing , and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover . 
Colonel Brandon	silent	Luckily Lady Middleton 's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . The young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . Mrs. Jennings , Lady Middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . She was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . Marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs. Jennings 's . Colonel Brandon , the friend of Sir John , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than Lady Middleton was to be his wife , or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton 's mother . He was silent and grave .

Colonel Brandon	kind	"she regarded him with respect and compassion . Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne , who , prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young , seemed resolved to undervalue his merits . "" Brandon is just the kind of man , "" said Willoughby one day , when they were talking of him together , "" whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to .

Colonel Brandon	lover	Her admiration and regard , even her sisterly regard , was all his own ; but he was a lover ; his attentions were wholly Marianne 's , and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing .

Colonel Brandon	friend	He was a particular friend of Sir John 's . 
Colonel Brandon	rich	Mrs. Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her . His manners to THEM , though calm , were perfectly kind ; to Mrs. Jennings , most attentively civil ; and on Colonel Brandon 's coming in soon after himself , he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say , that he only wanted to know him to be rich , to be equally civil to HIM . After staying with them half an hour , he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street , and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton . 
Colonel Brandon	man	Is he a man of fortune ? 
Colonel Brandon	undecided	Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it . 
Colonel Brandon	afraid	"They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable , when another lucky stop in Marianne 's performance brought her these words in the Colonel 's calm voice,-- "" I am afraid it can not take place very soon . "" "

Colonel Brandon	man	"He is undoubtedly a sensible man , and in his manners perfectly the gentleman . "" "" Indeed , "" replied Elinor , "" I believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house , ) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this . "
Colonel Brandon	confidence	His was an involuntary confidence , an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend -- not an application to a parent . 
Colonel Brandon	mistaken	There , however , he is quite mistaken . 
Colonel Brandon	happy	Colonel Brandon was now as happy , as all those who best loved him , believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to animation , and his spirits to cheerfulness ; and that Marianne found her own happiness in forming his , was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend . 
Colonel Brandon	able	"Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude , and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence , the Colonel should be able to take leave of them , as he immediately did , with the utmost sang - froid , and go away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor . What had really passed between them was to this effect . "" I have heard , "" said he , with great compassion , "" of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?-- "" Elinor told him that it was .

Colonel Brandon	surprised	""" The smallness of the house , "" said she , "" I can not imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income . "" By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr. Ferrars 's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation ; for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such an income , as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on-- and he said so . "
Colonel Brandon	sorry	I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive . 
Colonel Brandon	ready	If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present . 
Colonel Brandon	afraid	"His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least , I am afraid it can not take place very soon.-- "" Such was the sentence which , when misunderstood , so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings ; but after this narration of what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor , while they stood at the window , the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting , may perhaps appear in general , not less reasonably excited , nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage . CHAPTER 40 "
Colonel Brandon	ninny	""" "" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living 's being enough to allow them to marry .

Sir John Middleton	man	each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns , and endeavoring , by placing around them books and other possessions , to form themselves a home . Marianne 's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of ; and Elinor 's drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room . In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord , who called to welcome them to Barton , and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient . Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty . He had formerly visited at Stanhill , but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him . His countenance was thoroughly good - humoured ; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter . Their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction , and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him . 
Sir John Middleton	sportsman	Sir John was a sportsman , Lady Middleton a mother . 
Sir John Middleton	blessing	He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood , for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors , and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen . The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and 
Sir John Middleton	loud	Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song , and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted . 
Sir John Middleton	obliging	""" You are very obliging . "
Sir John Middleton	nice	"It was several days before Willoughby 's name was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family ; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings , indeed , were not so nice ; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;-- but one evening , Mrs. Dashwood , accidentally taking up a volume of Shakespeare , exclaimed , "" We have never finished Hamlet , Marianne ; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it . "
Sir John Middleton	urgent	Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park . 
Sir John Middleton	satisfied	But Sir John would not be satisfied -- the carriage should be sent for them and they must come . 
Sir John Middleton	stupid	"Sir John is as stupid as the weather . "" The rest of the company soon dropt in . "

Sir John Middleton	creatures	And they both long to see you of all things , for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world ; and I have told them it is all very true , and a great deal more . 
Sir John Middleton	cross	How can you be so cross as not to come ? Why they are your cousins , you know , after a fashion . YOU are my cousins , and they are my wife 's , so you must be related . 
Sir John Middleton	man	""" And Sir John too , "" cried the elder sister , "" what a charming man he is ! "" "
Sir John Middleton	concerned	how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it ! 
Sir John Middleton	good	Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was . 
Lady Middleton	unknown	The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress 's arrival ; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John 's description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own . 
Lady Middleton	cold	Her manners had all the elegance which her husband 's wanted . But they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by shewing that , though perfectly well - bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common - place inquiry or remark . 
Lady Middleton	ineffectual	She still screamed and sobbed lustily , kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her , and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week , some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple , the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch , and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it , gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.-- She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother 's arms , in quest of this medicine , and as the two boys chose to follow , though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind , the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours . 
Lady Middleton	woman	""" "" What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is ! "" said Lucy Steele . "
Lady Middleton	alone	One or two meetings of this kind had taken place , without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private , when Sir John called at the cottage one morning , to beg , in the name of charity , that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day , as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter , and she would otherwise be quite alone , except her mother and the two Miss Steeles . Elinor , who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view , in such a party as this was likely to be , more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well - bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose , immediately accepted the invitation ; Margaret , with her mother 's permission , was equally compliant , and Marianne , though always unwilling to join any of their parties , was persuaded by her mother , who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement , to go likewise . 
Lady Middleton	glad	""" I am glad , "" said Lady Middleton to Lucy , "" you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria 's basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight . "

Lady Middleton	miserable	"Wait only till tomorrow . "" With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself ; and to persuade her to check her agitation , to wait , at least , with the appearance of composure , till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect , was impossible ; for Marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings , by exclamations of wretchedness . In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase , and telling Marianne that he was gone , urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening , as a fresh argument for her to be calm . She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home , as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer . "
Lady Middleton	woman	""" Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman ! "
Lady Middleton	pleased	Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood . 
Lady Middleton	ready	So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton , so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her , that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant , and her sister not even genteel , she was as ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street ; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles , as soon as the Dashwoods ' invitation was known , that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place . 
Lady Middleton	ashamed	It checked the idleness of one , and the business of the other . Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them , and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of and administer at other times , she feared they would despise her for offering . 
Lady Middleton	angry	"And Lady Middleton , is SHE angry ? "" "" I can not suppose it possible that she should . "
Robert Ferrars	years	""" He was four years with my uncle , who lives at Longstaple , near Plymouth . "
Robert Ferrars	capable	I was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but I was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so well as me , Miss Dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him . 
Robert Ferrars	stupified	Not the smallest suspicion , therefore , had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself , he had been for some time , he believed , half stupified between the wonder , the horror , and the joy of such a deliverance . 
Robert Ferrars	proud	He was proud of his conquest , proud of tricking Edward , and very proud of marrying privately without his mother 's consent . What immediately followed is known .

"" Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid of her ; and exultingly said , she did not care how cross he was to her , as they must live together . "
Thomas Palmer	droll	"The studied indifference , insolence , and discontent of her husband gave her no pain ; and when he scolded or abused her , she was highly diverted . "" Mr. Palmer is so droll ! "" said she , in a whisper , to Elinor . "

Thomas Palmer	happy	""" Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you , "" said she ; "" What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mamma ? "
Thomas Palmer	uncertain	He was nice in his eating , uncertain in his hours ; fond of his child , though affecting to slight it ; and idled away the mornings at billiards , which ought to have been devoted to business . She liked him , however , upon the whole , much better than she had expected , and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;-- not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism , his selfishness , and his conceit , to rest with complacency on the remembrance of Edward 's generous temper , simple taste , and diffident feelings . Of Edward , or at least of some of his concerns , she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon , who had been into Dorsetshire lately ; and who , treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr. Ferrars , and the kind of confidant of himself , talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford , described its deficiencies , and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.--His behaviour to her in this , as well as in every other particular , his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days , his readiness to converse with her , and his deference for her opinion , might very well justify Mrs. Jennings 's persuasion of his attachment , and would have been enough , perhaps , had not Elinor still , as from the first , believed Marianne his real favourite , to make her suspect it herself . But as it was , such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head , except by Mrs. Jennings 's suggestion ; and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two;--she watched his eyes , while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour;--and while his looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne 's feeling , in her head and throat , the beginning of a heavy cold , because unexpressed by words , entirely escaped the latter lady 's observation;--SHE could 
Mrs. Ferrars	woman	But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to Robert , and the idea of that , for Edward 's sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures . 
Mrs. Ferrars	woman	Mrs. Ferrars was a little , thin woman , upright , even to formality , in her figure , and serious , even to sourness , in her aspect . 
Mrs. Ferrars	woman	She was not a woman of many words ; for , unlike people in general , she proportioned them to the number of her ideas ; and of the few syllables that did escape her , not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood , whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events . 
Mrs. Ferrars	civil	""" She was certainly very civil to you . "" "" Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast deal more . "
Mrs. Ferrars	woman	Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister . 
Mrs. Ferrars	good	"But it seemed to satisfy Lucy , for she directly replied , "" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward 's love , it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton 's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;-- and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me.-- "
Mrs. Ferrars	interested	"Surely , after doing so , she can not be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account-- she can not be interested in any thing that befalls him.-- She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child , and yet retain the anxiety of a parent !

Charlotte Palmer	younger	Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton , and totally unlike her in every respect .

Charlotte Palmer	able	She thought it probable that as they lived in the same county , Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some more particular account of Willoughby 's general character , than could be gathered from the Middletons ' partial acquaintance with him ; and she was eager to gain from any one , such a confirmation of his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne .

Charlotte Palmer	well	"Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight , that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her ; and , contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day , returned from that period to her own home , and her own habits , in which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share . About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street , Mrs. Jennings , on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer , entered the drawing - room , where Elinor was sitting by herself , with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful ; and giving her time only to form that idea , began directly to justify it , by saying , "" Lord !

Charlotte Palmer	pretty	Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you . 
Charlotte Palmer	happy	"Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like . "" CHAPTER 21 The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day , and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain each other . But this did not last long ; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head , had hardly done wondering at Charlotte 's being so happy without a cause , at Mr. Palmer 's acting so simply , with good abilities , and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife , before Sir John 's and Mrs. Jennings 's active zeal in the cause of society , procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe .

But Charlotte , she would not be satisfied , so Mr. Donavan was sent for ; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street , so he stepped over directly , and as soon as ever he saw the child , be said just as we did , that it was nothing in the world but the red gum , and then Charlotte was easy .

Fanny Dashwood	glad	Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know . 
Fanny Dashwood	kind	Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with . 
Fanny Dashwood	glad	"and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father . Fanny was startled at the proposal . "" I do not see how it can be done , "" said she , "" without affronting Lady Middleton , for they spend every day with her ; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it . "
Fanny Dashwood	ready	You know I am always ready to pay them any attention in my power , as my taking them out this evening shews .

Fanny Dashwood	uninformed	After a few moments ' chat , John Dashwood , recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister 's being there , quitted the room in quest of her ; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert , who , by the gay unconcern , the happy self - complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother 's love and liberality , to the prejudice of his banished brother , earned only by his own dissipated course of life , and that brother 's integrity , was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart . 
John Dashwood	pleased	Harry was vastly pleased . 
John Dashwood	sure	Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know . 
John Dashwood	present	Had both the children been there , the affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once ; but as Harry only was present , it was all conjectural assertion on both sides ; and every body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion , and to repeat it over and over again as often as they liked . 
John Dashwood	man	His father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them . He was not an ill - disposed young man , unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill - disposed : but he was , in general , well respected ; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties . Had he married a more amiable woman , he might have been made still more respectable than he was:--he might even have been made amiable himself ; for he was very young when he married , and very fond of his wife . 
John Dashwood	sorry	Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture . He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture was all sent around by water . It chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne 's . 
Margaret Dashwood	sure	I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon .
