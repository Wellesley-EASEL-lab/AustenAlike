Character	Modifier	Context
Anne Elliot	girl	A few years before , Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl , but her bloom had vanished early ; and as even in its height , 
Anne Elliot	faded	her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ) , there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem . 
Anne Elliot	thin	her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ) , there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem . 
Anne Elliot	little	Anne had been too little from home , too little seen . 
Anne Elliot	sorry	"; but Sir Walter 's remark was , soon afterwards-- "" The profession has its utility , but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it . "
Anne Elliot	dependent	More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close ; and time had softened down much , perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him , but she had been too dependent on time alone ; no aid had been given in change of place ( except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture ) , or in any novelty or enlargement of society . 
Anne Elliot	woman	She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home , and every anxiety attending his profession , all their probable fears , delays , and disappointments , she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement , than she had been in the sacrifice of it ; and this , she fully believed , had the usual share , had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs , without reference to the actual results of their case , which , as it happened , would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on . 
Anne Elliot	eloquent	How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been ! 
Anne Elliot	unable	Lady Russell , convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use , or any importance , in the choice of the house which they were going to secure , was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon , and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas ; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks , she was unable to give the full invitation she wished , and 
Anne Elliot	sensible	With a great deal of quiet observation , and a knowledge , which she often wished less , of her father 's character , she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible . She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind . 
Anne Elliot	impressed	Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger , that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister . 
Anne Elliot	unwell	The two families were so continually meeting , so much in the habit of running in and out of each other 's house at all hours , that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone ; but being alone , her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course . 
Anne Elliot	inferior	"In person , she was inferior to both sisters , and had , even in her bloom , only reached the dignity of being "" a fine girl . "" "
Anne Elliot	ill	I am so ill I can hardly speak . I have not seen a creature the whole morning ! 
Anne Elliot	sorry	""" I am sorry to find you unwell , "" replied Anne . "
Anne Elliot	ill	""" Yes , I made the best of it ; I always do : but I was very far from well at the time ; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning : very unfit to be left alone , I am sure . "
Anne Elliot	sure	""" Yes , I made the best of it ; I always do : but I was very far from well at the time ; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning : very unfit to be left alone , I am sure . "
Anne Elliot	ill	He would go , though I told him how ill I was . 
Anne Elliot	better	""" Well , you will soon be better now , "" replied Anne , cheerfully . "
Anne Elliot	ill	""" "" I can give you no account of them . I have not seen one of them to - day , except Mr Musgrove , who just stopped and spoke through the window , but without getting off his horse ; and though I told him how ill I was , not one of them have been near me . "
Anne Elliot	unwell	Anne , I am so very unwell ! 
Anne Elliot	well	"You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner . "" "
Anne Elliot	aware	"You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner . "" "
Anne Elliot	busy	"You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner . "" "
Anne Elliot	glad	""" I am very glad you were well enough , and I hope you had a pleasant party . "" "
Anne Elliot	able	"A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Anne 's side produced nearly a cure on Mary 's . She could soon sit upright on the sofa , and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner - time . Then , forgetting to think of it , she was at the other end of the room , beautifying a nosegay ; then , she ate her cold meat ; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk . "" Where shall we go ? "" said she , when they were ready . "
Anne Elliot	enough	"A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Anne 's side produced nearly a cure on Mary 's . She could soon sit upright on the sofa , and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner - time . Then , forgetting to think of it , she was at the other end of the room , beautifying a nosegay ; then , she ate her cold meat ; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk . "" Where shall we go ? "" said she , when they were ready . "
Anne Elliot	surprised	The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough ; and she was not at all surprised at the end of it , to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves , at Mary 's particular invitation . 
Anne Elliot	aware	She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves , but having no voice , no knowledge of the harp , and no fond parents , to sit by and fancy themselves delighted , her performance was little thought of , only out of civility , or to refresh the others , as she was well aware . She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself ; but this was no new sensation . 
Anne Elliot	easy	"Anne gave her credit , indeed , for feelings of great consideration towards herself , in all that related to Kellynch , and it pleased her : especially , as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute , in the instant even of introduction , that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft 's side , to give a bias of any sort . She was quite easy on that head , and consequently full of strength and courage , till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft 's suddenly saying,-- "" It was you , and not your sister , I find , that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with , when he was in this country . "
Anne Elliot	unpersuadable	Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause , and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him , where conviction was at least very agreeable , he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone , though he still wanted her to join them in the evening , when the child might be at rest for the night , and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her , but she was quite unpersuadable ; and this being the case , she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits . They were gone , she hoped , to be happy , however oddly constructed such happiness might seem ; as for herself , she was left with as many sensations of comfort , as were , perhaps , ever likely to be hers . She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child ; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant , making himself agreeable to others ? 
Anne Elliot	more	The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child 's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice . Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over . 
Anne Elliot	ignorant	"There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party ; and he was very much questioned , and especially by the two Miss Musgroves , who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him , as to the manner of living on board , daily regulations , food , hours , & c. , and their surprise at his accounts , at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable , drew from him some pleasant ridicule , which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant , and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat , or any cook to dress it if there were , or any servant to wait , or any knife and fork to use . From thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Musgrove 's who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying-- "" Ah ! "
Anne Elliot	glad	On its being proposed , Anne offered her services , as usual ; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument , she was extremely glad to be employed , and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved . 
Anne Elliot	aware	The Miss Hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for Henrietta and Louisa , they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good - will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals . If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ? These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne , while her fingers were mechanically at work , proceeding for half an hour together , equally without error , and without consciousness . Once she felt that he was looking at herself , observing her altered features , perhaps , trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him ; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her ; she was hardly aware of it , till she heard the answer ; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced ?

Anne Elliot	tired	"She is never tired of playing . "" "
Anne Elliot	determined	"I wish you had been with us yesterday , for then you might have decided between us ; and I am sure you would have thought as I did , unless you had been determined to give it against me . "" A dinner at Mr Musgrove 's had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne ; but she had staid at home , under the mixed plea of a headache of her own , and some return of indisposition in little Charles . She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth ; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening . "
Anne Elliot	present	One morning , very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves , at which Anne had not been present , Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing - room at the Cottage , where were only herself and the little invalid Charles , who was lying on the sofa . 
Anne Elliot	useful	She tried to dissuade Mary from going , but in vain ; and that being the case , thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves ' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise , as she might be useful in turning back with her sister , and lessening the interference in any plan of their own . 
Anne Elliot	glad	Anne , really tired herself , was glad to sit down ; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge - row , behind her , as if making their way back along the rough , wild sort of channel , down the centre . 
Anne Elliot	tired	""" Miss Elliot , I am sure you are tired , "" cried Mrs Croft . "
Anne Elliot	gainer	This was against her ; but on the other hand , he spent so much of his time at Uppercross , that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind , than as going towards him ; and , upon the whole , she believed she must , on this interesting question , be the gainer , almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society , in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell 
Anne Elliot	anxious	She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall : those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her ; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere . 
Anne Elliot	eloquent	When the evening was over , Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination . 
Anne Elliot	insensible	When they came to the steps , leading upwards from the beach , a gentleman , at the same moment preparing to come down , politely drew back , and stopped to give them way . They ascended and passed him ; and as they passed , Anne 's face caught his eye , and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration , which she could not be insensible of . 
Anne Elliot	sure	"The tone , the look , with which "" Thank God ! "" was uttered by Captain Wentworth , Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her ; nor the sight of him afterwards , as he sat near a table , leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed , as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul , and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them . "
Anne Elliot	sister	She was so wretched and so vehement , complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of Anne ; Anne , who was nothing to Louisa , while she was her sister , and had the best right to stay in Henrietta 's stead ! 
Anne Elliot	privy	And so much was said in this way , that Anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy , and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once . 
Anne Elliot	delighted	They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that Anne was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence . She was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character . A few days had made a change indeed ! If Louisa recovered , it would all be well again . 
Anne Elliot	last	They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that Anne was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence .

A few days had made a change indeed ! If Louisa recovered , it would all be well again . 
Anne Elliot	sensible	When they came to converse , she was soon sensible of some mental change . 
Anne Elliot	ashamed	Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father 's house in Camden Place , or her own sister 's intimacy with Mrs Clay . She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her . 
Anne Elliot	conscious	Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell . 
Anne Elliot	likely	"It will be some trial to us both . "" Anne did not shrink from it ; on the contrary , she truly felt as she said , in observing-- "" I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two ; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine . "
Anne Elliot	distressed	"Anne , amused in spite of herself , was rather distressed for an answer , and the Admiral , fearing he might not have been civil enough , took up the subject again , to say-- "" The next time you write to your good father , Miss Elliot , pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft 's , and say that we are settled here quite to our liking , and have no fault at all to find with the place . "
Anne Elliot	surprised	He spoke and looked so much in earnest , that Anne was not surprised to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself . 
Anne Elliot	better	"he was surprised at that ; "" and added , "" certainly you can not do better than to continue as you are ; you can not be better than well ; or I should recommend Gowland , the constant use of Gowland , during the spring months . "
Anne Elliot	ashamed	Anne was ashamed . 
Anne Elliot	ashamed	Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable , she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created , but they were nothing . 
Anne Elliot	satisfied	"when Anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to Mr Elliot , he agreed to their being nothing in themselves , but still maintained that , as a family connexion , as good company , as those who would collect good company around them , they had their value . Anne smiled and said , "" My idea of good company , Mr Elliot , is the company of clever , well - informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what I call good company . "" "" You are mistaken , "" said he gently , "" that is not good company ; that is the best . Good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice . Birth and good manners are essential ; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company ; on the contrary , it will do very well . My cousin Anne shakes her head . She is not satisfied . "
Anne Elliot	fastidious	She is fastidious . 
Anne Elliot	unjust	""" Pardon me , dear cousin , you are unjust in your own claims . "
Anne Elliot	proud	""" "" Well , "" said Anne , "" I certainly am proud , too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place . "
Anne Elliot	pleased	""" He looked , as he spoke , to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately occupying : a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant ; and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride , she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay ; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father 's getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her . "
Anne Elliot	fond	She had been very fond of her husband : she had buried him . She had been used to affluence : it was gone . 
Anne Elliot	fortunate	She had seen too much of the world , to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere , but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve , and would not use her ill ; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse , as a sister of her landlady , a nurse by profession , and who had always a home in that house when unemployed , chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her . 
Anne Elliot	sorry	She was not sorry for the excuse . 
Anne Elliot	sure	"They were only asked , she was sure , because Lady Dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold , was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her ; and she declined on her own account with great alacrity--""She was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow . "" "
Anne Elliot	happy	I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together . 
Anne Elliot	self	"Lady Russell let this pass , and only said in rejoinder , "" I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother 's place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me . You are your mother 's self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued ! My dearest Anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! "" "
Anne Elliot	satisfied	Though they had now been acquainted a month , she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character . 
Anne Elliot	ashamed	She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate . 
Anne Elliot	ashamed	"Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did ; but now she could safely suggest the name of "" Louisa . "
Anne Elliot	sorry	I should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be destroyed , or even wounded , by a circumstance of this sort . 
Anne Elliot	sincere	The rain was a mere trifle , and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot . 
Anne Elliot	simpleton	Her start was perceptible only to herself ; but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world , the most unaccountable and absurd ! 
Anne Elliot	determined	"After a moment 's pause he said : "" Though I came only yesterday , I have equipped myself properly for Bath already , you see , "" ( pointing to a new umbrella ) ; "" I wish you would make use of it , if you are determined to walk ; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair . "" She was very much obliged to him , but declined it all , repeating her conviction , that the rain would come to nothing at present , and adding , "" I am only waiting for Mr Elliot . "
Anne Elliot	obliged	"After a moment 's pause he said : "" Though I came only yesterday , I have equipped myself properly for Bath already , you see , "" ( pointing to a new umbrella ) ; "" I wish you would make use of it , if you are determined to walk ; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair . "" She was very much obliged to him , but declined it all , repeating her conviction , that the rain would come to nothing at present , and adding , "" I am only waiting for Mr Elliot . "
Anne Elliot	sure	"He will be here in a moment , I am sure . "" "
Anne Elliot	delicate	Anne is too delicate for them . 
Anne Elliot	wise	alas ! she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet . Another circumstance very essential for her to know , was how long he meant to be in Bath ; he had not mentioned it , or she could not recollect it . He might be only passing through . But it was more probable that he should be come to stay . 
Anne Elliot	conscious	No , it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite . She looked at her however , from time to time , anxiously ; and when the moment approached which must point him out , though not daring to look again ( for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen ) , she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell 's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him-- of her being , in short , intently observing him . 
Anne Elliot	impatient	The theatre or the rooms , where he was most likely to be , were not fashionable enough for the Elliots , whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties , in which they were getting more and more engaged ; and Anne , wearied of such a state of stagnation , sick of knowing nothing , and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried , was quite impatient for the concert evening . 
Anne Elliot	nearest	Anne was the nearest to him , and making yet a little advance , she instantly spoke . 
Anne Elliot	concerned	I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace . 
Anne Elliot	weak	She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak . 
Anne Elliot	happy	Upon Lady Russell 's appearance soon afterwards , the whole party was collected , and all that remained was to marshal themselves , and proceed into the Concert Room ; and be of all the consequence in their power , draw as many eyes , excite as many whispers , and disturb as many people as they could . Very , very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in . Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret , and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her , had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach ; and Anne -- but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne 's felicity , to draw any comparison between it and her sister 's ; the origin of one all selfish vanity , of the other all generous attachment . Anne saw nothing , thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room . 
Anne Elliot	scholar	I am a very poor Italian scholar . 
Anne Elliot	sorry	""" I will not oppose such kind politeness ; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient . "
Anne Elliot	curiosity	To have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance , by nameless people , is irresistible ; and Anne was all curiosity . 
Anne Elliot	sure	She was sure of a pleasant reception ; and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming , seemed hardly to have expected her , though it had been an appointment . 
Anne Elliot	party	You were a large party in yourselves , and you wanted nothing beyond . 
Anne Elliot	unable	"She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend 's penetration , unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her . After another short silence-- "" Pray , "" said Mrs Smith , "" is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ? Does he know that I am in Bath ? "
Anne Elliot	aware	""" "" I was not at all aware of this . "
Anne Elliot	happy	""" I should be extremely happy ; I hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you , "" replied Anne ; "" but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case . "
Anne Elliot	sure	I am sure you have , somehow or other , imbibed such a notion . 
Anne Elliot	cruel	Till it does come , you know , we women never mean to have anybody . It is a thing of course among us , that every man is refused , till he offers . But why should you be cruel ? 
Anne Elliot	happy	Well , my dear Miss Elliot , I hope and trust you will be very happy . 
Anne Elliot	safe	You are safe in all worldly matters , and safe in his character . 
Anne Elliot	happy	""" But , "" continued Anne , presently , "" though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot , I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could . "
Anne Elliot	creature	"I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot , and vouch for your being a very different creature from-- "" She checked herself just in time . "
Anne Elliot	curious	"I am more curious to know why he should be so different now . "" "" But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary ; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . "" "
Anne Elliot	able	You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due , by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm . 
Anne Elliot	inducement	Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement . 
Anne Elliot	particular	Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re - admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ) , to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject . 
Anne Elliot	glad	""" "" I am very glad to know all this , "" said Anne , after a little thoughtfulness . "
Anne Elliot	concerned	She was concerned for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling ; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister , and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils , without knowing how to avert any one of them . She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him . 
Anne Elliot	thankful	She was concerned for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling ; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister , and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils , without knowing how to avert any one of them . She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him . 
Anne Elliot	guarded	His attentive deference to her father , contrasted with his former language , was odious ; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith , she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness , or the sound of his artificial good sentiments . She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side . It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat ; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship ; and to retrace , as quietly as she could , the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along . She was accordingly more guarded , and more cool , than she had been the night before . 
Anne Elliot	safe	On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell , and accomplish the necessary communication ; and she would have gone directly after breakfast , but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble , which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion . She saw Mrs Clay fairly off , therefore , before she began to talk of spending the morning in Rivers Street . 
Anne Elliot	glad	"After the usual period of suspense , the usual sounds of approach were heard , and "" Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove "" were ushered into the room . Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance ; but Anne was really glad to see them ; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome ; and as soon as it became clear that these , their nearest relations , were not arrived with an views of accommodation in that house , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality , and do the honours of it very well . "
Anne Elliot	glad	""" I am extremely glad , indeed , "" cried Anne , "" particularly glad that this should happen ; and that of two sisters , who both deserve equally well , and who have always been such good friends , the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other-- that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort . I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both . "
Anne Elliot	sure	"I can not make her attend to the value of the property . It is a very fair match , as times go ; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life , and I shall not leave off now . "" "" Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove , "" exclaimed Anne , "" should be happy in their children 's marriages . They do everything to confer happiness , I am sure . "
Anne Elliot	late	You will be too late if you do not make haste . 
Anne Elliot	sure	She was earnestly begged to return and dine , and give them all the rest of the day , but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more , and fit only for home , where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose . 
Anne Elliot	full	He was full of ` to - morrow , ' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have 
Anne Elliot	able	She could not keep her appointment punctually , however ; the weather was unfavourable , and she had grieved over the rain on her friends ' account , and felt it very much on her own , before she was able to attempt the walk . When she reached the White Hart , and made her way to the proper apartment , she found herself neither arriving quite in time , nor the first to arrive . 
Anne Elliot	deep	"She was deep in the happiness of such misery , or the misery of such happiness , instantly . Two minutes after her entering the room , Captain Wentworth said-- "" We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials . "" Materials were at hand , on a separate table ; he went to it , and nearly turning his back to them all , was engrossed by writing . Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter 's engagement , and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper . "
Anne Elliot	afraid	"The chair was earnestly protested against , and Mrs Musgrove , who thought only of one sort of illness , having assured herself with some anxiety , that there had been no fall in the case ; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down , and got a blow on her head ; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall ; could part with her cheerfully , and depend on finding her better at night . Anxious to omit no possible precaution , Anne struggled , and said-- "" I am afraid , ma'am , that it is not perfectly understood . Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening . "
Anne Elliot	afraid	I am afraid there had been some mistake ; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth , that we hope to see them both . 
Anne Elliot	afraid	""" "" Do you think so ? But I am afraid ; and I should be so very sorry . "
Anne Elliot	sorry	""" "" Do you think so ? But I am afraid ; and I should be so very sorry . "
Anne Elliot	wrong	If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once , remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety , not of risk . When I yielded , I thought it was to duty , but no duty could be called in aid here . 
Anne Elliot	right	"It was in one of these short meetings , each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants , that she said-- "" I have been thinking over the past , and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong , I mean with regard to myself ; and I must believe that I was right , much as I suffered from it , that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now .

"
Anne Elliot	right	Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for Mrs Smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently . 
Anne Elliot	visitor	She was their earliest visitor in their settled life ; and Captain Wentworth , by putting her in the way of recovering her husband 's property in the West Indies , by writing for her , acting for her , and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend , fully requited the services which she had rendered , or ever meant to render , to his wife . 
Anne Elliot	tenderness	She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy , and yet be happy . Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits , as her friend Anne 's was in the warmth of her heart . Anne was tenderness itself , and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth 's affection . 
Captain Wentworth	lucky	He had been lucky in his profession ; but spending freely , what had come freely , had realized nothing . But he was confident that he should soon be rich : full of life and ardour , he knew that he should soon have a ship , and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted .

Captain Wentworth	name	"I will tell you why she is out of spirits . When the Crofts called this morning , ( they called here afterwards , did not they ? ) , they happened to say , that her brother , Captain Wentworth , is just returned to England , or paid off , or something , and is coming to see them almost directly ; and most unluckily it came into mamma 's head , when they were gone , that Wentworth , or something very like it , was the name of poor Richard 's captain at one time ; I do not know when or where , but a great while before he died , poor fellow ! And upon looking over his letters and things , she found it was so , and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man , and her head is quite full of it , and of poor Richard ! So we must be as merry as we can , that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things . "" "
Captain Wentworth	distant	Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause , and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him , where conviction was at least very agreeable , he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone , though he still wanted her to join them in the evening , when the child might be at rest for the night , and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her , but she was quite unpersuadable ; and this being the case , she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits . They were gone , she hoped , to be happy , however oddly constructed such happiness might seem ; as for herself , she was left with as many sensations of comfort , as were , perhaps , ever likely to be hers . She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child ; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant , making himself agreeable to others ? 
Captain Wentworth	indifferent	He must be either indifferent or unwilling . 
Captain Wentworth	unwilling	He must be either indifferent or unwilling . 
Captain Wentworth	satisfied	The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child 's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice . Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over . 
Captain Wentworth	gallant	"On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented , she was soon spared all suspense ; for , after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary : -- "" Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you , Anne , though he was so attentive to me .

Captain Wentworth	afraid	"but , Charles , tell Captain Wentworth , he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me , for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend . "" "
Captain Wentworth	collected	"I assure you , Captain Wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you . "" There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth 's face at this speech , a certain glance of his bright eye , and curl of his handsome mouth , which convinced Anne , that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove 's kind wishes , as to her son , he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him ; but it was too transient an indulgence of self - amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself ; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious , and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa , on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting , took a place by the latter , and entered into conversation with her , in a low voice , about her son , doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace , as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent 's feelings . They were actually on the same sofa , for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him ; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove . "

Captain Wentworth	traveller	""" What a great traveller you must have been , ma'am ! "" said Mrs Musgrove to Mrs Croft . "
Captain Wentworth	spoilt	The Miss Hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for Henrietta and Louisa , they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good - will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals . If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ? These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne , while her fingers were mechanically at work , proceeding for half an hour together , equally without error , and without consciousness . Once she felt that he was looking at herself , observing her altered features , perhaps , trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him ; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her ; she was hardly aware of it , till she heard the answer ; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced ? 
Captain Wentworth	absent	He had been absent only two Sundays , and when they parted , had left her interested , even to the height of his wishes , in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy , and obtaining that of Uppercross instead . It had then seemed the object nearest her heart , that Dr Shirley , the rector , who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office , but was now growing too infirm for many of them , should be quite fixed on engaging a curate ; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford , and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it . The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross , instead of going six miles another way ; of his having , in every respect , a better curacy ; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley , and of dear , good Dr Shirley 's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue , had been a great deal , even to Louisa , but had been almost everything to Henrietta . When he came back , alas ! 
Captain Wentworth	wrong	He was only wrong in accepting the attentions ( for accepting must be the word ) of two young women at once . 
Captain Wentworth	engaged	He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta . 
Captain Wentworth	determined	"He advised her against it , thought the jar too great ; but no , he reasoned and talked in vain , she smiled and said , "" I am determined I will : "" "
Captain Wentworth	sure	"Yes , I am sure : carry her gently to the inn . "" "" Yes , yes , to the inn , "" repeated Captain Wentworth , comparatively collected , and eager to be doing something . "
Captain Wentworth	sure	""" You will stay , I am sure ; you will stay and nurse her ; "" cried he , turning to her and speaking with a glow , and yet a gentleness , which seemed almost restoring the past . "
Captain Wentworth	satisfied	"Do you think this is a good plan ? "" She did : he was satisfied , and said no more . But the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her , as a proof of friendship , and of deference for her judgement , a great pleasure ; and when it became a sort of parting proof , its value did not lessen . "
Captain Wentworth	creature	As Louisa improved , he had improved , and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week . 
Captain Wentworth	man	"I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill - used man . "" "" Not at all , not at all ; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end . "" Anne looked down to hide her smile . "" No , no ; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that . "
Captain Wentworth	less	Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed : neither of them , probably , much the wiser for what they heard , and Anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly . 
Captain Wentworth	ready	She saw that he saw Elizabeth , that Elizabeth saw him , that there was complete internal recognition on each side ; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance , expecting it , and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness . 
Captain Wentworth	fond	It was really expected to be a good one , and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music . If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again , she fancied she should be satisfied ; and as to the power of addressing him , she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred . 
Captain Wentworth	sorry	He began by speaking of the concert gravely , more like the Captain Wentworth of Uppercross ; owned himself disappointed , had expected singing ; and in short , must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over . 
Captain Wentworth	attention	The careless expression was life to Anne , who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention , looking and listening with his whole soul ; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself . Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style ; he , half serious and half jesting , maintaining the scheme for the play , and she , invariably serious , most warmly opposing it , and not omitting to make it known that , however determined to go to Camden Place herself , she should not think herself very well used , if they went to the play without her . Mrs Musgrove interposed . 
Captain Wentworth	player	I am no card - player . 
Captain Wentworth	ready	""" "" There is no hurry on my side . I am only ready whenever you are . "
Captain Wentworth	hurry	"I am in very good anchorage here , "" ( smiling at Anne , ) "" well supplied , and want for nothing . No hurry for a signal at all . "
Captain Wentworth	ready	""" Yes , "" said he , "" very true ; here we separate , but Harville and I shall soon be after you ; that is , Harville , if you are ready , I am in half a minute . "
Captain Wentworth	sorry	I know you will not be sorry to be off . 
Captain Wentworth	ready	Mrs Croft left them , and Captain Wentworth , having sealed his letter with great rapidity , was indeed ready , and had even a hurried , agitated air , which shewed impatience to be gone . 
Captain Wentworth	man	It was creditable to have a sister married , and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion , by keeping Anne with her in the autumn ; and as her own sister must be better than her husband 's sisters , it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter . 
Captain Wentworth	ready	Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for Mrs Smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently . 
William Elliot	man	He was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed . 
William Elliot	worth	Yet so miserably had he conducted himself , that though she was at this present time ( the summer of 1814 ) wearing black ribbons for his wife , she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again . 
William Elliot	man	"This was very wonderful if it were true ; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot , already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary , of his being "" a man whom she had no wish to see . "" "
William Elliot	able	He had been in Bath about a fortnight ; ( he had passed through Bath in November , in his way to London , when the intelligence of Sir Walter 's being settled there had of course reached him , though only twenty - four hours in the place , but he had not been able to avail himself of it ;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath , and his first object on arriving , had been to leave his card in Camden Place , following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet , and when they did meet , by such great openness of conduct , such readiness to apologize for the past , such solicitude to be received as a relation again , that their former good understanding was completely re - established . 
William Elliot	indignant	Upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours , he was quite indignant . 
William Elliot	astonished	He was astonished , indeed , but his character and general conduct must refute it . 
William Elliot	richer	In all probability he was already the richer of the two , and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title . 
William Elliot	nice	How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one . Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if Elizabeth were his object ; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while Mr Elliot 's frequent visits were talked of . Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme , but without being much attended to .

William Elliot	better	"Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men , and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere . "" "
William Elliot	aware	"Anne drew a little back , while the others received his compliments , and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour , but "" he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before , "" & c. & c ; which was all as politely done , and as politely taken , as possible , but her part must follow then . Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter ; "" Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter "" ( there was no occasion for remembering Mary ) ; and Anne , smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was . "
William Elliot	man	They were not the same , but they were , perhaps , equally good . He sat down with them , and improved their conversation very much . There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man . Ten minutes were enough to certify that . His tone , his expressions , his choice of subject , his knowing where to stop ; it was all the operation of a sensible , discerning mind . 
William Elliot	candid	He was steady , observant , moderate , candid ; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness , which fancied itself strong feeling ; and yet , with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely , and a value for all the felicities of domestic life , which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess . 
William Elliot	happy	She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage . 
William Elliot	widower	Mr Elliot , too , it must be remembered , had not been a widower seven months . 
William Elliot	man	""" Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man , and in many respects I think highly of him , "" said Anne ; "" but we should not suit . "" "
William Elliot	man	That he was a sensible man , an agreeable man , that he talked well , professed good opinions , seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle , this was all clear enough . 
William Elliot	polished	She saw that there had been bad habits ; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing ; that there had been a period of his life ( and probably not a short one ) when he had been , at least , careless in all serious matters ; and , though he might now think very differently , who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever , cautious man , grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ? How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ? Mr Elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open . There was never any burst of feeling , any warmth of indignation or delight , at the evil or good of others . This , to Anne , was a decided imperfection .

William Elliot	aware	""" Perhaps , "" said Mr Elliot , speaking low , "" I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of . "" "" Indeed ! "
William Elliot	likely	Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith , meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call ; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object . 
William Elliot	aware	"She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend 's penetration , unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her . After another short silence-- "" Pray , "" said Mrs Smith , "" is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ? Does he know that I am in Bath ? "
William Elliot	safe	"if these are your only objections , "" cried Mrs Smith , archly , "" Mr Elliot is safe , and I shall give myself no more trouble about him . "
William Elliot	aware	Of course , he can not be aware of the importance to me . 
William Elliot	man	But I have not known him long ; and he is not a man , I think , to be known intimately soon . 
William Elliot	such	Was he at all such as he appears now ? 
William Elliot	unprejudiced	Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced . 
William Elliot	man	Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience ; a designing , wary , cold - blooded being , who thinks only of himself ; whom for his own interest or ease , would be guilty of any cruelty , or any treachery , that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character . He has no feeling for others . 
William Elliot	cause	Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin , he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction . He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion .

William Elliot	friend	He was the intimate friend of my dear husband , who trusted and loved him , and thought him as good as himself . 
William Elliot	inferior	He was then the inferior in circumstances ; he was then the poor one ; he had chambers in the Temple , and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman . He had always a home with us whenever he chose it ; he was always welcome ; he was like a brother .

William Elliot	determined	""" "" Mr Elliot , "" replied Mrs Smith , "" at that period of his life , had one object in view : to make his fortune , and by a rather quicker process than the law . He was determined to make it by marriage . "
William Elliot	determined	He was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and I know it was his belief ( whether justly or not , of course I can not decide ) , that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence . 
William Elliot	different	"I am more curious to know why he should be so different now .

"" "
William Elliot	careless	But he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when I came to examine his papers , I found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed .

William Elliot	man	Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous , artificial , worldly man , who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness . 
William Elliot	unfeeling	Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion . She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot 's marriage ) they had been as before always together , and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune . 
William Elliot	husband	I considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and I could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband . 
William Elliot	sensible	My heart bled for you , as I talked of happiness ; and yet he is sensible , he is agreeable , and with such a woman as you , it was not absolutely hopeless . 
William Elliot	agreeable	My heart bled for you , as I talked of happiness ; and yet he is sensible , he is agreeable , and with such a woman as you , it was not absolutely hopeless .

William Elliot	determined	He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return . 
William Elliot	full	He was full of ` to - morrow , ' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have 
William Elliot	determined	He soon quitted Bath ; and on Mrs Clay 's quitting it soon afterwards , and being next heard of as established under his protection in London , it was evident how double a game he had been playing , and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman , at least . 
Charles Musgrove	son	No second attachment , the only thoroughly natural , happy , and sufficient cure , at her time of life , had been possible to the nice tone of her mind , the fastidiousness of her taste , in the small limits of the society around them . She had been solicited , when about two - and - twenty , to change her name , by the young man , who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister ; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal ; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man , whose landed property and general importance were second in that country , only to Sir Walter 's , and of good character and appearance ; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more , while Anne was nineteen , she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty - two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father 's house , and settled so permanently near herself . 
Charles Musgrove	civil	Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth , nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort .

Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits . As it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else .

Charles Musgrove	pleased	"I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; "" do n't do this , "" and "" do n't do that ; "" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them "
Charles Musgrove	apt	"Again , it was Mary 's complaint , that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the Great House with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place . And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves , one of them after talking of rank , people of rank , and jealousy of rank , said , "" I have no scruple of observing to you , how nonsensical some persons are about their place , because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it ; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious , especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma . Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma , but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it . "
Charles Musgrove	determined	"Anne will send for me if anything is the matter . "" Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain . Mary knew , from Charles 's manner of speaking , that he was quite determined on going , and that it would be of no use to teaze him . "
Charles Musgrove	bad	If there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it , and Charles is as bad as any of them . 
Charles Musgrove	unfeeling	How does he know that he is going on well , or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence ? I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling . 
Charles Musgrove	sure	I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother , but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick - room than Charles , for I can not be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if I told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about . 
Charles Musgrove	sure	""" And I am sure , Sir . "" said Mrs Musgrove , "" it was a lucky day for us , when you were put captain into that ship . "
Charles Musgrove	fitted	Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable , substantial size , infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour , than tenderness and sentiment ; and while the agitations of Anne 's slender form , and pensive face , may be considered as very completely screened , Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self - command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son , whom alive nobody had cared for . Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions . 
Charles Musgrove	confined	When you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and I can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship . While we were together , you know , there was nothing to be feared .

Charles Musgrove	sisters	Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters . 
Charles Musgrove	incumbrance	Charles agreed , but declared his resolution of not going away . He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would . 
Charles Musgrove	cheerful	He was tolerably cheerful . 
Charles Musgrove	afraid	Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey , which is not very likely , considering the care that will be taken of her ; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to - morrow . 
Charles Musgrove	sure	Anne will not be sorry to join us , I am sure . 
Charles Musgrove	forgetful	"How can you be so forgetful ? "" "" Phoo ! phoo ! "" replied Charles , "" what 's an evening party ? "
Charles Musgrove	sure	"It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father 's ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us . "" "
Charles Musgrove	aware	He begged their pardon , but he had forgotten his gloves , and instantly crossing the room to the writing table , he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper , placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time , and hastily collecting his gloves , was again out of the room , almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it : the work of an instant ! 
Charles Musgrove	doctor	I wish Sarah was here to doctor you , but I am no doctor myself . 
Charles Musgrove	constant	Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge : that he had been constant unconsciously , nay unintentionally ; that he had meant to forget her , and believed it to be done . 
Charles Musgrove	unjust	He had imagined himself indifferent , when he had only been angry ; and he had been unjust to her merits , because he had been a sufferer from them . Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself , maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness ; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice , and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself .

Charles Musgrove	wrong	"I had not thought seriously on this subject before . I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways ; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls , at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report , were there no other ill effects . I had been grossly wrong , and must abide the consequences . "" He found too late , in short , that he had entangled himself ; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at all , he must regard himself as bound to her , if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed . "
Charles Musgrove	eldest	Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies . It was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way . Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins , and a very amiable , pleasing young man , between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth 's introduction . He was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father 's house , only two miles from Uppercross .

Charles Musgrove	sure	Here was a fortune at once ; besides which , there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war ; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy .

Charles Musgrove	positive	But Charles is so positive ! 
Charles Musgrove	inclined	It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth . 
Charles Musgrove	near	"Charles , in the meanwhile , was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt , now that he was so near ; and very evidently , though more fearfully , trying to induce his wife to go too . But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength ; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop , as she felt so tired , she resolutely answered , "" Oh ! no , indeed !

Charles Musgrove	sure	I told him the distance and the road , and I told him of the church 's being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , I thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon .

Mary Musgrove	glad	I am glad I did not think of it before . 
Mary Musgrove	able	She wished , however to see the Crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned . They came : the master of the house was not at home , but the two sisters were together ; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne , while the Admiral sat by Mary , and made himself very agreeable by his good - humoured notice of her little boys , she was well able to watch for a likeness , and if it failed her in the features , to catch it in the voice , or in the turn of sentiment and expression . Mrs Croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person . She had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather - beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight - and - thirty . Her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour . 
Mary Musgrove	ready	"The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage ; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot , the coach was beginning to be listened for , when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in . That she was coming to apologize , and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves , was the first black idea ; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted , when Louisa made all right by saying , that she only came on foot , to leave more room for the harp , which was bringing in the carriage . "" And I will tell you our reason , "" she added , "" and all about it . I am come on to give you notice , that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening , especially mamma ; she is thinking so much of poor Richard ! "

Mary Musgrove	sure	"I should not go , you may be sure , if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child . "" The next moment she was tapping at her husband 's dressing - room door , and as Anne followed her up stairs , she was in time for the whole conversation , which began with Mary 's saying , in a tone of great exultation-- "" I mean to go with you , Charles , for I am of no more use at home than you are .

Mary Musgrove	able	If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child , I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like . 
Mary Musgrove	more	The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child 's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice . Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over .

Mary Musgrove	fond	"It was a very fine November day , and the Miss Musgroves came through the little grounds , and stopped for no other purpose than to say , that they were going to take a long walk , and therefore concluded Mary could not like to go with them ; and when Mary immediately replied , with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker , "" Oh , yes , I should like to join you very much , I am very fond of a long walk ; "" Anne felt persuaded , by the looks of the two girls , that it was precisely what they did not wish , and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce , of everything being to be communicated , and everything being to be done together , however undesired and inconvenient .

Mary Musgrove	happy	The brow of the hill , where they remained , was a cheerful spot : Louisa returned ; and Mary , finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile , was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her ; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away , to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge - row , and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound , Mary was happy no longer

Sir Walter Elliot	man	[ Persuasion by Jane Austen 1818 ] Chapter 1 Sir Walter Elliot , of Kellynch Hall , in Somersetshire , was a man who , for his own amusement , never took up any book but the Baronetage ; there he found occupation for an idle hour , and consolation in a distressed one ; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect , by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents ; there any unwelcome sensations , arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century ; and there , if every other leaf were powerless , he could read his own history with an interest which never failed . 
Sir Walter Elliot	handsome	He had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty - four , was still a very fine man . 
Sir Walter Elliot	important	It was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament : he might there be important at comparatively little expense . 
Sir Walter Elliot	afraid	The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now . You need not be afraid , Miss Elliot , of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected . 
Sir Walter Elliot	fond	"but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure - grounds , is another thing . I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable ; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden . I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour , I assure you , be he sailor or soldier . "" After a short pause , Mr Shepherd presumed to say-- "" In all these cases , there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant . Your interest , Sir Walter , is in pretty safe hands . "
Sir Walter Elliot	jealous	"I venture to hint , that Sir Walter Elliot can not be half so jealous for his own , as John Shepherd will be for him . "" Here Anne spoke-- "" The navy , I think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give . "
Sir Walter Elliot	wise	Sir Walter was not very wise ; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel , that a more unobjectionable tenant , in all essentials , than Admiral Croft bid fair to be , could hardly offer . 
Sir Walter Elliot	man	Chapter 4 He was not Mr Wentworth , the former curate of Monkford , however suspicious appearances may be , but a Captain Frederick Wentworth , his brother , who being made commander in consequence of the action off St Domingo , and not immediately employed , had come into Somersetshire , in the summer of 1806 ; and having no parent living , found a home for half a year at Monkford . He was , at that time , a remarkably fine young man , with a great deal of intelligence , spirit , and brilliancy ; and Anne an extremely pretty girl , with gentleness , modesty , taste , and feeling . 
Sir Walter Elliot	troublesome	You are extremely troublesome . 
Sir Walter Elliot	able	"Mr Elliot appeared to think that he ( Sir Walter ) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted ; "" but Sir Walter had "" not been able to return the compliment entirely , which had embarrassed him . "
Sir Walter Elliot	ashamed	The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street , perfectly to Sir Walter 's satisfaction . He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance , and did , in fact , think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral , than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him . 
Sir Walter Elliot	earliest	Sir Walter , his two daughters , and Mrs Clay , were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening ; and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for , they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room . 
Sir Walter Elliot	unlikely	The baronet , nevertheless , is not unlikely to marry again ; he is quite fool enough .

Mrs. Smith	young	When one lives in the world , a man or woman 's marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought . I was very young , and associated only with the young , and we were a thoughtless , gay set , without any strict rules of conduct . 
Mrs. Smith	sure	"I am more curious to know why he should be so different now . "" "" But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary ; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . "" "
Mrs. Smith	determined	Here it is ; I would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot , I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy . 
Mrs. Smith	sick	I am sick of it . 
Mrs. Smith	willing	I was willing to hope that you must fare better . 
Mrs. Smith	able	Mrs Smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done . 
Mrs. Smith	rich	She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy , and yet be happy . Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits , as her friend Anne 's was in the warmth of her heart . Anne was tenderness itself , and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth 's affection .

Lady Russell	favourite	To Lady Russell , indeed , she was a most dear and highly valued god - daughter , favourite , and friend . 
Lady Russell	zealous	Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject , and gave it much serious consideration . She was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities , whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great , from the opposition of two leading principles .

Lady Russell	desirous	She was of strict integrity herself , with a delicate sense of honour ; but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter 's feelings , as solicitous for the credit of the family , as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them , as anybody of sense and honesty could well be . She was a benevolent , charitable , good woman , and capable of strong attachments , most correct in her conduct , strict in her notions of decorum , and with manners that were held a standard of good - breeding .

Lady Russell	anxious	But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth . 
Lady Russell	fond	And with regard to Anne 's dislike of Bath , she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising , first , from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there , after her mother 's death ; and secondly , from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself . Lady Russell was fond of Bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend 's health , by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good .

Lady Russell	unwilling	Lady Russell , convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use , or any importance , in the choice of the house which they were going to secure , was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon , and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas ; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks , she was unable to give the full invitation she wished , and 
Lady Russell	sorry	Lady Russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all , wondered , grieved , and feared ; and the affront it contained to Anne , in Mrs Clay 's being of so much use , while Anne could be of none , was a very sore aggravation . 
Lady Russell	clever	"I am afraid of her , as I have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but I respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross . "" "
Lady Russell	pleased	I think she would be so much pleased with his mind , that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner . 
Lady Russell	decided	Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot . He thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence . He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits ; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend , could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man , without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create . Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot . 
Lady Russell	maker	"Anne heard her , and made no violent exclamations ; she only smiled , blushed , and gently shook her head . "" I am no match - maker , as you well know , "" said Lady Russell , "" being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations . "
Lady Russell	afraid	Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card . Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life , who make themselves up so little . If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen ; but last time I called , I observed the blinds were let down immediately . 
Lady Russell	quick	This however was what Lady Russell had now to do . She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both ; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each ; that because Captain Wentworth 's manners had not suited her own ideas , she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity ; and that because Mr Elliot 's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness , their general politeness and suavity , she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well - regulated mind .

Lady Russell	wrong	There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do , than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong , and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes . There is a quickness of perception in some , a nicety in the discernment of character , a natural penetration , in short , which no experience in others can equal , and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend .

Lady Russell	woman	But she was a very good woman , and if her second object was to be sensible and well - judging , her first was to see Anne happy . She loved Anne better than she loved her own abilities ; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over , found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child . 
Louisa Musgrove	glad	Well , I am very glad indeed : 
Louisa Musgrove	favourite	Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion , though too wise to acknowledge as much at home , where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife ; for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite , she could not but think , as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience , that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either . 
Louisa Musgrove	ashamed	I am almost ashamed to say it . 
Louisa Musgrove	character	After the hints you gave just now , which did but confirm my own observations , the last time I was in company with him , I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on . I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this . Your sister is an amiable creature ; but yours is the character of decision and firmness , I see . 
Louisa Musgrove	sure	You are never sure of a good impression being durable ; everybody may sway it . 
Louisa Musgrove	beautiful	If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life , she will cherish all her present powers of mind . 
Louisa Musgrove	happy	If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life , she will cherish all her present powers of mind . 
Louisa Musgrove	precipitate	he put out his hands ; she was too precipitate by half a second , she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb , and was taken up lifeless ! There was no wound , no blood , no visible bruise ; but her eyes were closed , she breathed not , her face was like death . The horror of the moment to all who stood around ! 
Louisa Musgrove	dead	""" She is dead ! "
Louisa Musgrove	dead	"she is dead ! "" screamed Mary , catching hold of her husband , and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable ; and in another moment , Henrietta , sinking under the conviction , lost her senses too , and would have fallen on the steps , but for Captain Benwick and Anne , who caught and supported her between them . "
Louisa Musgrove	able	Everything was safe enough , and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject . Chapter 14 Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge . They had left Louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them . They had been all in lodgings together . 
Louisa Musgrove	daughter	Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme . She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight . Anne enquired after Captain Benwick , Mary 's face was clouded directly . Charles laughed . 
Louisa Musgrove	favourite	Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister 's account ; but , however , Louisa is a great favourite with both . 
Louisa Musgrove	obstinate	She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak . 
Elizabeth Elliot	younger	Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall , presiding and directing with a self - possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was . For thirteen years had she been doing the honours , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing - rooms and dining - rooms in the country . 
Elizabeth Elliot	satisfied	Thirteen winters ' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded , and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms , as she travelled up to London with her father , for a few weeks ' annual enjoyment of the great world . She had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine - and - twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions ; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever , but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet - blood within the next twelvemonth or two . Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth , but now she liked it not . 
Elizabeth Elliot	woman	It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd , who had returned , after an unprosperous marriage , to her father 's house , with the additional burden of two children . She was a clever young woman , who understood the art of pleasing -- the art of pleasing , at least , at Kellynch Hall ; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot , as to have been already staying there more than once , in spite of all that Lady Russell , who thought it a friendship quite out of place , could hint of caution and reserve . 
Elizabeth Elliot	earnest	She had never received from her more than outward attention , nothing beyond the observances of complaisance ; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry , against previous inclination . She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : Elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility . 
Elizabeth Elliot	happy	Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth : but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal , that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand ; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her . 
Elizabeth Elliot	sure	""" I can not possibly do without Anne , "" was Mary 's reasoning ; and Elizabeth 's reply was , "" Then I am sure Anne had better stay , for nobody will want her in Bath . "
Elizabeth Elliot	more	She had little hope of success ; but Elizabeth , who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself , should never , she thought , 
Elizabeth Elliot	first	"In that house Elizabeth must be first ; and she was in the habit of such general observance as "" Miss Elliot , "" that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible . "
Elizabeth Elliot	happy	Upon Lady Russell 's appearance soon afterwards , the whole party was collected , and all that remained was to marshal themselves , and proceed into the Concert Room ; and be of all the consequence in their power , draw as many eyes , excite as many whispers , and disturb as many people as they could . Very , very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in . Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret , and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her , had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach ; and Anne -- but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne 's felicity , to draw any comparison between it and her sister 's ; the origin of one all selfish vanity , of the other all generous attachment . Anne saw nothing , thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room . 
Elizabeth Elliot	used	"I was really in pain for him ; for your hard - hearted sister , Miss Anne , seems bent on cruelty . "" "" Oh ! "" cried Elizabeth , "" I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman 's hints . "
Elizabeth Elliot	sensible	But , upon my word , I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men . 
Elizabeth Elliot	ashamed	I used to think she had some taste in dress , but I was ashamed of her at the concert . 
Elizabeth Elliot	happy	It was a struggle between propriety and vanity ; but vanity got the better , and then Elizabeth was happy again . 
Elizabeth Elliot	sure	I am sure she would rather not come ; she can not feel easy with us . 
Captain Benwick	lieutenant	Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia ; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him , on his return from Lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies . 
Captain Benwick	younger	He is younger than I am ; younger in feeling , if not in fact ; younger as a man . 
Captain Benwick	shy	He was shy , and disposed to abstraction ; but the engaging mildness of her countenance , and gentleness of her manners , soon had their effect ; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion . He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading , though principally in poetry ; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening 's indulgence in the discussion of subjects , which his usual companions had probably no concern in , she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction , which had naturally grown out of their conversation . For , though shy , he did not seem reserved ; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints ; and having talked of poetry , the richness of the present age , and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first - rate poets , trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred , and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos ; and moreover , how the Giaour was to be pronounced , he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet , and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other ; he repeated , with such tremulous feeling , the various lines which imaged a broken heart , or a mind destroyed by wretchedness , and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood , that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry , and to say , that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely ; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly . His looks shewing him not pained , but pleased with this allusion to his situation , she was emboldened to go on ; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind , she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study ; and on being requested to particularize , mentioned such works of our best moralists , such collections of the finest letters , such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering , as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts , and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances . Captain Benwick listened attentively , and seemed grateful for the interest implied ; and though with a shake of the head , and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his , noted down the names of those she recommended , and promised to procure and read them

Captain Benwick	attentive	Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of Mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , Charles taking care of his sister , and Captain Benwick attending to her . She gave a moment 's recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . There she had listened to Henrietta 's schemes for Dr Shirley 's leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen Mr Elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa , or those who were wrapt up in her welfare . Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance . 
Captain Benwick	unjust	Without emulating the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry , she would have attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard , for his sake ; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend . 
Captain Benwick	man	Captain Benwick is very well , I believe , but he is a very odd young man . 
Captain Benwick	afraid	I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull ; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart - broken man as Captain Benwick . 
Captain Benwick	man	He has walked with me , sometimes , from one end of the sands to the other , without saying a word . He is not at all a well - bred young man . 
Captain Benwick	sort	He is just Lady Russell 's sort . 
Captain Benwick	man	""" He is a man , "" said Lady Russell , "" whom I have no wish to see . "
Captain Benwick	disposed	He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined , or he was too shy ; and after giving him a week 's indulgence , Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite . The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school , bringing with them Mrs Harville 's little children , to improve the noise of Uppercross , and lessen that of Lyme .

The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school , bringing with them Mrs Harville 's little children , to improve the noise of Uppercross , and lessen that of Lyme . 
Captain Benwick	inconsolable	They had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since Henrietta 's coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and Louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable . 
Captain Benwick	commander	He is only a commander , it is true , made last summer , and these are bad times for getting on , but he has not another fault that I know of . 
Captain Benwick	person	When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon , you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery . 
Captain Benwick	man	He is a clever man , a reading man ; and I confess , that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise . Had it been the effect of gratitude , had he learnt to love her , because he believed her to be preferring him , it would have been another thing . But I have no reason to suppose it so . 
Captain Benwick	man	""" That can not be much to your taste , I know , "" said she ; "" but I do believe him to be an excellent young man . "
Captain Benwick	fellow	He is a brave fellow . 
Admiral Croft	glad	"I am glad I was not a week later then . "" The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry . "
Admiral Croft	sure	"A very good man , and very much the gentleman I am sure : but I should think , Miss Elliot , "" ( looking with serious reflection ) , "" I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life . "
Admiral Croft	snug	So I got Sophy to lend me a hand , and we soon shifted their quarters ; and now I am quite snug , with my little shaving glass in one corner , and another great thing that I never go near . 
Admiral Croft	civil	"Anne , amused in spite of herself , was rather distressed for an answer , and the Admiral , fearing he might not have been civil enough , took up the subject again , to say-- "" The next time you write to your good father , Miss Elliot , pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft 's , and say that we are settled here quite to our liking , and have no fault at all to find with the place . "
Admiral Croft	glad	"He will be glad to hear it . "" "
Admiral Croft	glad	I am glad they are not on this side of the way . 
Admiral Croft	sure	Here are pretty girls enough , I am sure . 
Admiral Croft	native	By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make , Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire , who having acquired a very handsome fortune , was wishing to settle in his own country , and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood , which , however , had not suited him ; that accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold , Mr Shepherd observed , Sir Walter 's concerns could not be kept a secret,)-- accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let , and understanding his ( Mr Shepherd 's ) connection with the owner , he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries , and had , in the course of a pretty long conference , expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel ; and given Mr Shepherd , in his explicit account of himself , every proof of his being a most responsible , eligible tenant . 
Admiral Croft	admiral	"Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman 's family , and mentioned a place ; and Anne , after the little pause which followed , added-- "" He is a rear admiral of the white . "
Admiral Croft	man	Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral 's family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant . He was a married man , and without children ; the very state to be wished for . 
Mrs. Croft	sister	"A house was never taken good care of , Mr Shepherd observed , without a lady : he did not know , whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady , as where there were many children . A lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world . He had seen Mrs Croft , too ; she was at Taunton with the admiral , and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over . "" And a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be , "" continued he ; "" asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the Admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , Sir Walter , I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford . Bless me ! "
Mrs. Croft	sure	""" Miss Elliot , I am sure you are tired , "" cried Mrs Croft . "
Mrs. Croft	agony	I am half agony , half hope . 
Mrs. Croft	hope	I am half agony , half hope . 
Henrietta Musgrove	prettiest	Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest , Louisa had the higher spirits ; and she knew not now , whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him . 
Henrietta Musgrove	ready	"Well now , I think we had better turn back ; I am excessively tired . "" Henrietta , conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as Mary wished ; but "" No ! "" said Charles Musgrove , and "" No , no ! "" cried Louisa more eagerly , and taking her sister aside , seemed to be arguing the matter warmly . "
Henrietta Musgrove	sure	She has cousins here , you know , and many acquaintance , which would make it cheerful for her , and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand , in case of his having another seizure . 
Henrietta Musgrove	afraid	"I am afraid of her , as I have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but I respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross . "" "
Henrietta Musgrove	helpless	To some of the best - looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned , for , though partially revived , she was quite helpless ; and in this manner , Anne walking by her side , and Charles attending to his wife , they set forward , treading back with feelings unutterable , the ground , which so lately , so very lately , and so light of heart , they had passed along . 
Henrietta Musgrove	anxious	She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good , yet was still unwilling to be away , till , touched by the thought of her father and mother , she gave it up ; she consented , she was anxious to be at home . 
Henrietta Musgrove	bad	""" And so , ma'am , all these thing considered , "" said Mrs Musgrove , in her powerful whisper , "" though we could have wished it different , yet , altogether , we did not think it fair to stand out any longer , for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it , and Henrietta was pretty near as bad ; and so we thought they had better marry at once , and make the best of it , as many others have done before them .
