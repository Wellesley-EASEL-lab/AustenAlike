Character	Modifier	Context
Emma Woodhouse	youngest	Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her . She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister 's marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period . 
Emma Woodhouse	friend	the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella 's marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection . She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault . How was she to bear the change?--It

How was she to bear the change?--It 
Emma Woodhouse	aware	was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house 
Emma Woodhouse	equal	Mrs. Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her . She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma 's losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour 's ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr. Weston 's disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor , ' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .

Emma Woodhouse	happy	She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse 's kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside . These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father 's sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston . 
Emma Woodhouse	delighted	She was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated . 
Emma Woodhouse	busy	She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware . 
Emma Woodhouse	aware	She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware . 
Emma Woodhouse	convinced	Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith 's being exactly the young friend she wanted -- exactly the something which her home required . 
Emma Woodhouse	afraid	But while I visit at Hartfield , and you are so kind to me , Miss Woodhouse , I am not afraid of what any body can do . 
Emma Woodhouse	sorry	Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin . 
Emma Woodhouse	quick	She was always quick and assured : Isabella slow and diffident . And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all . In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her .

Emma Woodhouse	mistress	She was always quick and assured : Isabella slow and diffident . And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all . In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her . 
Emma Woodhouse	pretty	"Very well ; I shall not attempt to deny Emma 's being pretty . "" "" Pretty ! "
Emma Woodhouse	loveliness	She is loveliness itself . 
Emma Woodhouse	handsome	Considering how very handsome she is , she appears to be little occupied with it ; her vanity lies another way . 
Emma Woodhouse	creature	"With all dear Emma 's little faults , she is an excellent creature . Where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ? No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times . "" "" Very well ; I will not plague you any more . "
Emma Woodhouse	angel	Emma shall be an angel , and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella . John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children . 
Emma Woodhouse	happy	"I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good . But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home . "" "" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present , "" said Mrs. Weston , "" as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I can not wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse 's account . "
Emma Woodhouse	afraid	""" But I am afraid , Mr. Elton , Harriet will not like to sit . "
Emma Woodhouse	unwilling	She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician , but she was not unwilling to have others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved . 
Emma Woodhouse	sorry	She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician , but she was not unwilling to have others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved . 
Emma Woodhouse	proud	I am rather proud of little George . 
Emma Woodhouse	sorry	""" Pray do . I 'd rather you would . "" Emma was not sorry to be pressed . "
Emma Woodhouse	sure	You will express yourself very properly , I am sure . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me what I had best do -- No , no , I do not mean that -- 
Emma Woodhouse	determined	I am quite determined to refuse him . 
Emma Woodhouse	concerned	Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence . The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all . 
Emma Woodhouse	happy	Emma will be happy to entertain you . 
Emma Woodhouse	anxious	""" "" I am glad you think so ; and the good hands , I hope , may not be wanting . "" "" Come , "" said he , "" you are anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you that you have improved her . "
Emma Woodhouse	mistaken	"madness , if it is so ; but I hope you are mistaken . "" "
Emma Woodhouse	different	I assure you mine are very different . I must think your statement by no means fair . 
Emma Woodhouse	mistaken	Harriet 's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice . Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess . 
Emma Woodhouse	obliged	""" "" I am very much obliged to you , "" said Emma , laughing again . "
Emma Woodhouse	well	I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls . I shall leave off while I am well . 
Emma Woodhouse	able	He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton ; but when she considered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of Mr. Knightley 's pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about . 
Emma Woodhouse	sorry	She was sorry , but could not repent . 
Emma Woodhouse	satisfied	Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin 's being no otherwise remembered , than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton , of the utmost advantage to the latter . Her views of improving her little friend 's mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to - morrow . 
Emma Woodhouse	happy	I am very happy . 
Emma Woodhouse	pleased	"Give me the book , I will write it down , and then there can be no possible reflection on you . "" Harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love . It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity . "" I shall never let that book go out of my own hands , "" said she . "" Very well , "" replied Emma ; "" a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better I shall be pleased . "
Emma Woodhouse	sure	I am sure she will be pleased with the children . We are very proud of the children , are not we , papa ? 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	"I am sure I do not know who is not . "" "" "
Emma Woodhouse	charming	"After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again-- "" I do so wonder , Miss Woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married ! so charming as you are!""-- Emma laughed , and replied , "" My being charming , Harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; I must find other people charming -- one other person at least . "
Emma Woodhouse	sure	And , without love , I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine . 
Emma Woodhouse	maid	""" Never mind , Harriet , I shall not be a poor old maid ; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public ! A single woman , with a very narrow income , must be a ridiculous , disagreeable old maid ! the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else . "
Emma Woodhouse	mind	If I know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty . 
Emma Woodhouse	compassionate	Emma was very compassionate ; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness , her counsel and her patience , as from her purse . 
Emma Woodhouse	concerned	This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute . They did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield . To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her . She gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child 's pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them . 
Emma Woodhouse	companion	"I really am a most troublesome companion to you both , but I hope I am not often so ill - equipped . Mr. Elton , I must beg leave to stop at your house , and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string , or any thing just to keep my boot on . "" "
Emma Woodhouse	ashamed	the good Bateses -- I am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters . 
Emma Woodhouse	sorry	""" "" How sorry I am ! "
Emma Woodhouse	unwilling	I should be unwilling , I own , to live in any other part of the town;-- there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in : but _ we _ are so remarkably airy!--Mr . Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air . 
Emma Woodhouse	satisfied	I should be unwilling , I own , to live in any other part of the town;-- there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in : but _ we _ are so remarkably airy!--Mr . Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air . 
Emma Woodhouse	sorry	"You make the best of it-- but after you have been a week at Hartfield , you are all of you different creatures ; you do not look like the same . Now I can not say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present . "" "" I am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but I assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere , I am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming . "
Emma Woodhouse	sorry	""" But why should you be sorry , sir?--I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good . "" "
Emma Woodhouse	object	""" Me ! "" she replied with a smile of astonishment , "" are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton 's object ? "
Emma Woodhouse	quarrelsome	""" Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the "" Very true , my love , "" which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all . She could not be complying , she dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence . "
Emma Woodhouse	warm	"Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of "" Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!""-- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs. Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners . "
Emma Woodhouse	rude	For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet 's , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton 's nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to .

Emma Woodhouse	sorry	""" "" I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case , "" replied Emma ; "" but am disposed to side with you , Mr. Weston . "
Emma Woodhouse	alone	Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston . She should then have heard more : Mrs. Weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge . 
Emma Woodhouse	sorry	I am sorry for it . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	I can not bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves . 
Emma Woodhouse	satisfied	"Emma listened , and then coolly said , "" I shall not be satisfied , unless he comes . "" "
Emma Woodhouse	astonished	"Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied , "" I am very much astonished , Mr. Elton . "
Emma Woodhouse	overpowered	"She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton 's sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed-- "" Charming Miss Woodhouse ! allow me to interpret this interesting silence . It confesses that you have long understood me . "" "" No , sir , "" cried Emma , "" it confesses no such thing . "
Emma Woodhouse	sorry	As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings-- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared , ) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent . 
Emma Woodhouse	first	She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more , ) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away . 
Emma Woodhouse	fond	You are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , I think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones . I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr. Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill 's situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect .

Emma Woodhouse	happy	I am extremely happy . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	I was sure it could not be far off ; but I had put my huswife upon it , you see , without being aware , and so it was quite hid , but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table .

Emma Woodhouse	sure	She often says , when the letter is first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work'-- do n't you , ma'am?--And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her-- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word .

Emma Woodhouse	sure	Jane often says , when she is here , ` I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish my eyes may last me as well . ' 
Emma Woodhouse	afraid	""" "" I am afraid we must be running away , "" said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise--""My father will be expecting us . "
Emma Woodhouse	able	She regained the street -- happy in this , that though much had been forced on her against her will , though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax 's letter , she had been able to escape the letter itself . 
Emma Woodhouse	willing	Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon 's actions from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first . 
Emma Woodhouse	cautious	She was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious ! 
Emma Woodhouse	happy	""" I am happy you approved , "" said Emma , smiling ; "" but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield . "
Emma Woodhouse	deficient	""" I am happy you approved , "" said Emma , smiling ; "" but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield . "
Emma Woodhouse	attentive	If any thing , you are too attentive . 
Emma Woodhouse	deficient	""" No , "" said Mr. Knightley , nearly at the same time ; "" you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension . "
Emma Woodhouse	surprized	"Mr. Elton is going to be married . "" Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton , and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start , and a little blush , at the sound . "
Emma Woodhouse	sorry	Emma , alone with her father , had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry-- and to marry strangers too -- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject . It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news , as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long ; but she was sorry for Harriet : 
Emma Woodhouse	likely	It was now about the time that she was likely to call . 
Emma Woodhouse	afraid	""" She had set out from Mrs. Goddard 's half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to Hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford's . ""--Ford 's was the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper , and haberdasher 's shop united ; the shop first in size and fashion in the place.--""And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in-- to be sure it was so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's-- who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!-- Dear Miss Woodhouse ! only think .

Emma Woodhouse	conduct	She was not thoroughly comfortable herself . The young man 's conduct , and his sister 's , seemed the result of real feeling , and she could not but pity them . 
Emma Woodhouse	sister	She was not thoroughly comfortable herself . The young man 's conduct , and his sister 's , seemed the result of real feeling , and she could not but pity them . 
Emma Woodhouse	thankful	During his present short stay , Emma had barely seen him ; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over , and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension , now spread over his air . She was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again . 
Emma Woodhouse	easy	As to connexion , there Emma was perfectly easy ; persuaded , that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet , he had done nothing . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	"I am sure they will bring him soon . "" "
Emma Woodhouse	pleased	She was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan , and travel earlier , later , and quicker , that he might gain half a day . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed . He was very much pleased with Randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to Highbury , Highbury itself , Hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one 's _ own _ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it . That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma 's brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a 
Emma Woodhouse	confident	His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening . 
Emma Woodhouse	afraid	You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue . 
Emma Woodhouse	glad	Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland . 
Emma Woodhouse	right	""" You are right . "
Emma Woodhouse	sure	There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.--No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly . 
Emma Woodhouse	glad	""" This is coming as you should do , "" said she ; "" like a gentleman.-- I am quite glad to see you . "" He thanked her , observing , "" How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! "
Emma Woodhouse	afraid	You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	""" No , I am sure it is not from the Campbells . "
Emma Woodhouse	object	She was his object , and every body must perceive it . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	I can not at all consent to Mr. Knightley 's marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely . 
Emma Woodhouse	amazed	"I am amazed that you should think of such a thing . "" "" My dear Emma , I have told you what led me to think of it . "
Emma Woodhouse	sure	I am sure he has not the least idea of it . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	In the way of love , I am sure he does not . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	""" If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion . "
Emma Woodhouse	easy	The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day ; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity . She must have delighted the Coles -- worthy people , who deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind her that would not soon die away . Perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy . She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax 's feelings to Frank Churchill . 
Emma Woodhouse	certain	his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue . 
Emma Woodhouse	happy	""" Emma would be "" very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates , & c. , "" and they did at last move out of the shop , with no farther delay from Miss Bates than , "" How do you do , Mrs. Ford ? "
Emma Woodhouse	sure	And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment . 
Emma Woodhouse	shocked	But I was really quite shocked the other day-- for Mr. Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	` I am sure you must be , ' said he , ` and I will send you another supply 
Emma Woodhouse	obliged	However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose . 
Emma Woodhouse	glad	I am always glad to see him . But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _ that _ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil . 
Emma Woodhouse	shocked	He told Patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for Mrs. Hodges _ would _ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed ! 
Emma Woodhouse	aware	I wanted to keep it from Jane 's knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware . 
Emma Woodhouse	concerned	Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot .

Emma Woodhouse	ready	Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him . 
Emma Woodhouse	sorry	""" Indeed , I am very sorry to be right in this instance . "

Emma Woodhouse	willing	She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton ; and Harriet 's mind , she had been willing to hope , had been lately gaining strength . 
Emma Woodhouse	ungrateful	"Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been ! "" "
Emma Woodhouse	sure	Warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , I am sure it will . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	She would not be in a hurry to find fault , but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease , but not elegance.-- She was almost sure that for a young woman , a stranger , a bride , there was too much ease . Her person was rather good ; her face not unpretty ; but neither feature , nor air , nor voice , nor manner , were elegant . Emma thought at least it would turn out so . 
Emma Woodhouse	charming	""" Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh , ) what do you think of her?-- Is not she very charming ? "
Emma Woodhouse	indebted	The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an _ introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs. Elton's -- probably some vulgar , dashing widow , who , with the help of a boarder , just made a shift to live!-- The dignity of Miss Woodhouse , of Hartfield , was sunk indeed ! 
Emma Woodhouse	musical	I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs. Elton . 
Emma Woodhouse	performer	"Upon these occasions , a lady 's character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer . "" "

Emma Woodhouse	pleased	Besides the Eltons , it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley ; so far it was all of course-- and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction , and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet 's begging to be allowed to decline it . 
Emma Woodhouse	stricken	Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley , she was more conscience - stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been.--Mr 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	""" If we were in the other room , "" said Emma , "" if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen . "
Emma Woodhouse	determined	She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax 's feelings ; and they followed the other ladies out of the room , arm in arm , with an appearance of good - will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each . 
Emma Woodhouse	occupied	_ She _ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings , and trying to understand the degree of her agitation , which she rather thought was considerable .

And as to my dear little boys , I must say , that if Aunt Emma has not time for them , I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley , who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one-- and who , when he is at home , is either reading to himself or settling his accounts . "" "
Emma Woodhouse	able	She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration . 
Emma Woodhouse	inclined	She had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room . 
Emma Woodhouse	surprized	In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant . She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again .

Emma Woodhouse	amazement	Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus-- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned!--Well , this is brilliant ! I am all amazement ! 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	do you recommend this side?--Well , I am sure , Mr. Churchill-- only it seems too good -- but just as you please . 
Emma Woodhouse	ready	"Every body is asleep ! "" "" I am ready , "" said Emma , "" whenever I am wanted . "
Emma Woodhouse	well	Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again . It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ) , as well as Miss Smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent-- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and Harriet not much otherwise , Emma would not interfere with . 
Emma Woodhouse	equal	"I never was equal to this . "" "" Here , "" resumed Harriet , turning to her box again , "" here is something still more valuable , I mean that _ has _ _ been _ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did . "" "

Emma Woodhouse	silent	Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances 
Emma Woodhouse	determined	I am determined against all interference . 
Emma Woodhouse	decided	Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend . 
Emma Woodhouse	object	That Emma was his object appeared indisputable .

Emma Woodhouse	ashamed	"I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other . "" Emma was extremely confused . She could not endure to give him the true explanation ; for though her suspicions were by no means removed , she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them . "" Oh ! "" she cried in evident embarrassment , "" it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves . "" "" The joke , "" he replied gravely , "" seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill . "" He had hoped she would speak again , but she did not . "
Emma Woodhouse	delighted	I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do-- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do . 
Emma Woodhouse	glad	It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey , that as soon as she was satisfied of her father 's comfort , she was glad to leave him , and look around her ; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation , more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family . She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered-- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the Abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and Emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had ; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably . 
Emma Woodhouse	glad	Mr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete - a - tete ; but she was glad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion , and turned from her with little ceremony . 
Emma Woodhouse	sorry	Now they seemed in pleasant conversation . There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm ; but now she feared it not . 
Emma Woodhouse	glad	Emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him . 
Emma Woodhouse	glad	"Emma returned all her attention to her father , saying in secret-- "" I am glad I have done being in love with him . I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning . "
Emma Woodhouse	gay	Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity ; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected .

Emma Woodhouse	humble	But you were humble . 
Emma Woodhouse	afraid	There are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet , ) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	I am sure I do not know . 
Emma Woodhouse	unfeeling	How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates ? 
Emma Woodhouse	open	_ There _ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach . 
Emma Woodhouse	unfeeling	"She hoped no one could have said to her , "" How could you be so unfeeling to your father?-- I must , I will tell you truths while I can . "" "
Emma Woodhouse	remiss	If attention , in future , could do away the past , she might hope to be forgiven . She had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious . 
Emma Woodhouse	determined	She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her . It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit . 
Emma Woodhouse	ashamed	She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence , so justly and truly hers . 
Emma Woodhouse	pleased	She heard Miss Bates 's voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon . The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room . Jane 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	` Oh ! ' said I , ` it is Miss Woodhouse : I am sure you will like to see her . 
Emma Woodhouse	interested	""" Emma was most sincerely interested . "
Emma Woodhouse	ignorant	"It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton .

Emma Woodhouse	sure	Emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself . Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again . While he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going-- her father began his inquiries . 
Emma Woodhouse	attentive	"She is always so attentive to them ! "" "
Emma Woodhouse	gratified--	She was warmly gratified-- and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;-- whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say-- she might , perhaps , have rather offered it -- but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips-- when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , 
Emma Woodhouse	indisposed	""" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ; "" and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge 's at the time proposed .

Emma Woodhouse	friend	"Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , "" Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith . ""--She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet 's imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments . "
Emma Woodhouse	fearful	She understood it all ; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings , she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert . But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge ! There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else . Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first . Considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet 's mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would.-- She must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible . An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston 's parting words . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly-- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr. Frank Churchill 's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax . You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly . 
Emma Woodhouse	delighted	""" Why should you caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill .

Emma Woodhouse	mistaken	And that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing!--I am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , was spoken of .

She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself .

Emma Woodhouse	able	Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!-- No longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their's!--How was it to be endured ? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet 's sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in Harriet 's society all that he wanted ; if Harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing Emma 's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ? When it came to such a pitch as this , she was not able to refrain from a start , or a heavy sigh , or even from walking about the room for a few seconds -- and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn , was in the resolution of her own better conduct , and the hope that , however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past , it would yet find her more rational , more acquainted with herself , and leave her less to regret when it were gone .

Emma Woodhouse	ready	I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness .

Emma Woodhouse	happy	, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	She was sure of Mrs. Weston 's wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr. Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct .

Emma Woodhouse	sensible	She was sensible of all the affection it evinced .

Emma Woodhouse	happy	She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield . 
Emma Woodhouse	fortunate	Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate.-- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke . She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella 's invitation ; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it , without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss . 
Emma Woodhouse	competent	There was a communication before her , one which _ she _ only could be competent to make-- the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at 
Emma Woodhouse	gratified	"There was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.-- She came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone , "" This is most kind , indeed!--Miss Woodhouse , it is impossible for me to express -- I hope you will believe -- Excuse me for being so entirely without words . "" Emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of Mrs. Elton 's voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand . "
Emma Woodhouse	certain	""" Have not you mistaken the day ? "" said Emma . "" I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to - morrow.--Mr "
Emma Woodhouse	pleased	"She was pleased , on taking leave , to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say , "" It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility . "
Emma Woodhouse	scrupulous	"But , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend-- "" "" Oh ! you are too scrupulous , indeed you are , "" cried Emma warmly , and taking her hand . "" You owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even-- "" "" You are very kind , but I know what my manners were to you.-- "
Emma Woodhouse	right	"The smile was returned as Jane answered , "" You are very right ; it has been thought of . "
Emma Woodhouse	sure	""" "" I am sure you were of use to me , "" cried Emma . "
Emma Woodhouse	sure	I am very sure you did me good . 
Emma Woodhouse	girl	"And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen . "" "" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks--`Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor 's leave'--something which , you knew , I did not approve . "
Emma Woodhouse	aware	She was aware herself , that , parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not have rested , as it now almost wholly did , on Isabella 's letters . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	Emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston , whose marriages taking them from Hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from Hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?-- He would not deny that he did , she was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him?-- Who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes 
Emma Woodhouse	stupidest	well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse 's mind.--It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other-- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place . Mrs. Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield ! And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable!-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband 's plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma . 
Emma Woodhouse	satisfied	""" I am perfectly satisfied , "" replied Emma , with the brightest smiles , "" and most sincerely wish them happy . "
Emma Woodhouse	fool	""" "" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before . "" "" I hope so -- for at that time I was a fool . "" "" And I am changed also ; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet 's good qualities . "

Emma Woodhouse	sorry	She was not sorry . 
Emma Woodhouse	Serious	Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them . 
Emma Woodhouse	glad	Emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- a number of embarrassing recollections on each side . 
Emma Woodhouse	glad	"I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you -- and to give you joy in person . "" He thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness . "
Emma Woodhouse	sure	""" Oh ! no -- what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare-- "" But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that Emma could not help saying , "" I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time , you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.-- I am sure it was a consolation to you . "" "" Oh ! "
Emma Woodhouse	wretch	"I was the most miserable wretch ! "" "" Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth . "
Emma Woodhouse	sure	I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation . 
Emma Woodhouse	readier	I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation . 
Emma Woodhouse	delighted	""" "" Very beautiful , indeed , "" replied Emma ; and she spoke so kindly , that he gratefully burst out , "" How delighted I am to see you again ! and to see you in such excellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world . "
Emma Woodhouse	ready	She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!-- It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr. Elton!-- The stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed . 
Emma Woodhouse	respectable	No objection was raised on the father 's side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin , who was now introduced at Hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend . She had no doubt of Harriet 's happiness with any good - tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement . She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness . She would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out . She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;--or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself .

Emma Woodhouse	good	Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times-- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it . 
Emma Woodhouse	satisfied	Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied . This is what we all feel . 
Emma Woodhouse	right	you were perfectly right ! 
Emma Woodhouse	right	Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _ any _ _ thing _ to like to yield . 
Emma Woodhouse	person	, however , Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments ' free observation of the entrance and ground - plot of the house -- and was hardly there , when Jane Fairfax appeared , coming quickly in from the garden , and with a look of escape.-- Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon , there was a start at first ; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of . 
Emma Woodhouse	sure	is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly.--I 
Emma Woodhouse	afraid	""" Thank you , thank you -- but on no account.--I would rather walk.-- And for _ me _ to be afraid of walking alone!--I , who may so soon have to guard others !

Emma Woodhouse	safe.--	The strength , resolution , and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys , commanded his fullest dependence . While either of them protected him and his , Hartfield was safe.-- But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November .

George Knightley	judge	"Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good . I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good ! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma , Mr. Knightley . "" "" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle . "" "" Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject . We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with . Mr. Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith . She is not the superior young woman which Emma 's friend ought to be . But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself . "

George Knightley	all	There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of-- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr. John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection . CHAPTER XVI The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst of all .

George Knightley	privy	"Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove . CHAPTER X One morning , about ten days after Mrs. Churchill 's decease , Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston , who "" could not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak with her . ""-- He met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father , "" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do , if it be possible . Mrs. Weston wants to see you . "
George Knightley	man	"But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . "" The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech , the many bitter feelings , made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma 's side , to enable her to say on reply , "" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . "" Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father 's footsteps . He was coming through the hall . Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him . "
George Knightley	dear	How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her , as every feeling declared him now to be ? 
George Knightley	shocked	She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.-- How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates ! How directly , how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not 
George Knightley	silent	He was silent . 
George Knightley	surprized	"Emma was quite relieved , and could presently say , with a little more composure , "" _ You _ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it -- but--(with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness . "" "
George Knightley	sorry	I am sorry for _ her _ . 
George Knightley	kind	"Emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied , "" You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right.-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion . "
George Knightley	mistaken	"Emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied , "" You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right.-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion . "
George Knightley	certain	and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!--I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt-- I could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?-- Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature . 
George Knightley	wise	"They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet , and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject , if possible . She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr. Knightley startled her , by saying , "" You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity.--You are wise -- but _ I _ can not be wise . "
George Knightley	obliging	He _ had _ despaired at one period ; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence , as for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn , her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to , might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency ; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it , and seek no farther explanation . 
George Knightley	glad	""" I shall be very glad to look it over , "" said he ; "" but it seems long . "
George Knightley	sure	"he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here . "" "" And I have not forgotten , "" said Emma , "" how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would . "
George Knightley	right	You pass it over very handsomely-- but you were perfectly right . 
George Knightley	ready	He has had great faults , faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness ; and I am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves : but still as he is , beyond a doubt , really attached to Miss Fairfax , and will soon , it may be hoped , have the advantage of being constantly with her , I am very ready to believe his character will improve , and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants .

But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes . "

George Knightley	aware	"He only means-- "" "" He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two , "" interrupted she , with a sort of serious smile--""much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject . "
George Knightley	deal	Emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston , whose marriages taking them from Hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from Hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?-- He would not deny that he did , she was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him?-- Who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes 
George Knightley	glad	Mr. Knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why could not they go on as they had done ? 
George Knightley	happy	would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him ! But that would be all over now.-- 
George Knightley	silent	"After the first chat of pleasure he was silent ; and then , in a graver tone , began with , "" I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news . "

George Knightley	sure	""" It is so , indeed , "" continued Mr. Knightley ; "" I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left me not half an hour ago . "" She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement . "" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were the same . But in time they will . Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject . "
George Knightley	sure	"Emma could not help laughing as she answered , "" Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But , Mr. Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _ accepted _ him . I could suppose she might in time -- but can she already?-- Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him?--It was not Harriet 's hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox . "" The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was , at this moment , so strong to Emma 's feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet 's side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , "" No , I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin , "" that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature . "
George Knightley	sure	Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are ? 
George Knightley	sure	""" I am quite sure , "" he replied , speaking very distinctly , "" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so . "
Harriet Smith	girl	As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty . A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion . 
Harriet Smith	daughter	Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody . 
Harriet Smith	girl	She was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired . 
Harriet Smith	short	She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance . 
Harriet Smith	plump	She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance . 
Harriet Smith	addition	She had ventured once alone to Randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a Harriet Smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges . 
Harriet Smith	clever	Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to . Her 
Harriet Smith	friend	Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith 's being exactly the young friend she wanted -- exactly the something which her home required . 
Harriet Smith	useful	Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem . Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful . 
Harriet Smith	ready	She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain . 
Harriet Smith	satisfied	She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her ; and looked no farther . 
Harriet Smith	ready	Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games ; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good - humoured and obliging . 
Harriet Smith	fond	He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts , because she had said how fond she was of them , and in every thing else he was so very obliging . 
Harriet Smith	fond	She was very fond of singing . 
Harriet Smith	insensible	Harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father 's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder . 
Harriet Smith	woman	"Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good . I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good ! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma , Mr. Knightley . "" "" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle . "" "" Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject . We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with . Mr. Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith . She is not the superior young woman which Emma 's friend ought to be . But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself . "
Harriet Smith	flatterer	She is a flatterer in all her ways ; and so much the worse , because undesigned . 
Harriet Smith	creature	She was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature . 
Harriet Smith	fortunate	There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , 
Harriet Smith	surprized	She was so surprized she did not know what to do . 
Harriet Smith	silent	"I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it . "" Harriet was silent . With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued : "" You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect . "
Harriet Smith	kind	, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me what I had best do -- No , no , I do not mean that -- 
Harriet Smith	judge	""" Not for the world , "" said Emma , smiling graciously , "" would I advise you either way . You must be the best judge of your own happiness . "
Harriet Smith	right	"Do you think I am right ? "" "
Harriet Smith	decided	While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving . 
Harriet Smith	secure	"Now I am secure of you for ever . "" Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly . "" You could not have visited me ! "" she cried , looking aghast . "
Harriet Smith	low	She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton . 
Harriet Smith	deal	"You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey - Mill . "" "
Harriet Smith	sure	""" And I am sure I should never want to go there ; for I am never happy but at Hartfield . "" "
Harriet Smith	happy	""" And I am sure I should never want to go there ; for I am never happy but at Hartfield . "" "
Harriet Smith	sure	"I am sure Miss Nash would -- for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen - draper . "" "
Harriet Smith	people	Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves . 
Harriet Smith	people	Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves . 
Harriet Smith	hearted	The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected Mr. Martin . 
Harriet Smith	natural	She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations . 
Harriet Smith	girl	She is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information . 
Harriet Smith	pretty	She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all . My only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him . I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse . But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well .

Harriet Smith	daughter	be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman 's daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen 's daughters , no one , I apprehend , 
Harriet Smith	happy	Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it . She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer . 
Harriet Smith	disinclined	Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him . 
Harriet Smith	girl	Harriet 's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice . Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess .

Harriet Smith	girl	Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl .

Harriet Smith	modest	"She was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more . "" Here have I , "" said she , "" actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man . She might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if I had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him . Oh ! "
Harriet Smith	safe	Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas . 
Harriet Smith	prisoner	"The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton 's absenting himself . It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them,-- "" Ah ! "
Harriet Smith	creature	Her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma 's eyes-- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do . It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life . Her second duty now , inferior only to her father 's claims , was to promote Harriet 's comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making . 
Harriet Smith	unfortunate	Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs. Goddard 's ; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth . 
Harriet Smith	worse	she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton . 
Harriet Smith	sure	Emma saw him only once ; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure _ just _ to meet with him , or _ just _ to miss him , _ just _ to hear his voice , or see his shoulder , _ just _ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture . 
Harriet Smith	occupied	Harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess . 
Harriet Smith	persuadable	Upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly Mrs. Goddard , if not Mrs. Bates , might be depended on for bearing him company-- Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter 's going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him .

Harriet Smith	match	From Harriet 's happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father 's being present to engage Mr. Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady 's conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good . Harriet would have been a better match . 
Harriet Smith	object	was not to be doubted that poor Harriet 's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve , and her own share in the story , under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him , had in all likelihood been given also . She was , of course , the object of their joint dislike.-- When they had nothing else to say , it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse ; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her , found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet . 
Harriet Smith	able	She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable . 
Harriet Smith	insensible	In the few minutes ' conversation which she had yet had with him , while Harriet had been partially insensible , he had spoken of her terror , her naivete , her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm , with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at last , after Harriet 's own account had been given , he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms .

Harriet Smith	dull	While he was so dull , it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable . 
Harriet Smith	creature	Would not Harriet be the very creature described ? 
Harriet Smith	conscious	Her influence would have been enough . And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been risking her friend 's happiness on most insufficient grounds . 
Harriet Smith	afraid	"Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet , that she must not allow herself to think of him , and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--""But , with common sense , "" she added , "" I am afraid I have had little to do . "" "
Harriet Smith	angry	She was extremely angry with herself . 
Harriet Smith	angry	If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful.-- As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account . 
Harriet Smith	days	Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous.-- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted . 
Harriet Smith	charge	She understood it all ; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings , she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert . But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge ! There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else . Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first . Considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet 's mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would.-- She must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible . An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston 's parting words . 
Harriet Smith	glad	Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits-- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _ compassion _ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now , ) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet 's hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right.-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost.-- Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves . Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight.--Emma 's tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet 's , but they were not less . 
Harriet Smith	conscious	Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation . From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse 's encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it . When they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her . Emma knew it to have been very much the case .

Harriet Smith	agitated	"But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . "" The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech , the many bitter feelings , made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma 's side , to enable her to say on reply , "" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . "" Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father 's footsteps . He was coming through the hall . Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him . "
Harriet Smith	wretched	How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself , and living under!--The blunders , the blindness of her own head and heart!--she sat still , she walked about , she tried her own room , she tried the shrubbery -- in every place , every posture , she perceived that she had acted most weakly ; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree ; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying ; that she was wretched , and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness . To understand , thoroughly understand her own heart , was the first endeavour . 
Harriet Smith	secure	too strongly for the offence -- but far , far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear - sighted goodwill.-- She had no hope , nothing to deserve the name of hope , that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question ; but there was a hope ( at times a slight one , at times much stronger , ) that Harriet might have deceived herself , and be overrating his regard for _ her_.--Wish it she must , for his sake -- be the consequence nothing to herself , but his remaining single all his life . Could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father , the same Mr. Knightley to all the world ; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured.--Marriage , in fact , would not do for her . 
Harriet Smith	able	It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.-- He was expected back every day . The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course . In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet.-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet 's confidence . To talk would be only to irritate.--She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _ one _ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful . This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma 's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs. Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates 's , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates 's parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded . 
Harriet Smith	thing	""" While he spoke , Emma 's mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word-- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet 's hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet 's secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not.--It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two-- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not . She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain . "
Harriet Smith	loser	She would be a loser in every way . 
Harriet Smith	weight	In such a party , Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise ; but for the poor girl herself , it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment . 
Harriet Smith	safe	Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister 's side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable.-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse 's carriage.--It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square . 
Harriet Smith	girl	Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin 's cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.-- Much of this , I have no doubt , she may thank you for . 
Harriet Smith	distressed	Harriet was a little distressed -- did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend 's approbation , Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--

Harriet Smith	first	Martin and Harriet Smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married . 
Harriet Smith	humble	How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!-- But Harriet was less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly.-- Her inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little felt.-- She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton 's being to stoop in marrying her , than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.-- Alas ! 
Harriet Smith	negligent	She had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared . In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .

"
Jane Fairfax	companion	"She would be such a delightful companion for Emma . "" "
Jane Fairfax	unwell	so considerate!--But however , she is so far from well , that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home , and try an air that always agrees with her ; and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her-- and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here , than go to Ireland , if she is unwell . 
Jane Fairfax	unwell	Jane desired me to do it , so I always do : and so I began to - day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell , than I burst out , quite frightened , with ` Bless me ! 
Jane Fairfax	orphan	Jane Fairfax was an orphan , the only child of Mrs. Bates 's youngest daughter . 
Jane Fairfax	old	He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane 's age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter 's great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education . 
Jane Fairfax	young	It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over . The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane 's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents . They continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of Miss Campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn . 
Jane Fairfax	well	She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter 's marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort . 
Jane Fairfax	dear	"It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else . Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- Mr. Frank Churchill -- must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence . Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought ! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . But "" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other .

Jane Fairfax	deep	They were the first entitled , after Mrs. Weston and Emma , to be made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her . 
Jane Fairfax	likely	The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother 's ; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton 's activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will . Mr. Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more . He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma . 
Jane Fairfax	able	The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother 's ; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton 's activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will . Mr. Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more . He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma . 
Jane Fairfax	present	He could not understand it ; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least-- symptoms of admiration on his side , which , having once observed , he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish to escape any of Emma 's errors of imagination . _ She _ was not present when the suspicion first arose . 
Jane Fairfax	kind	""" But you are always kind . "" There was no bearing such an "" always ; "" and to break through her dreadful gratitude , Emma made the direct inquiry of-- "" Where -- may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going ? "" "" To a Mrs. Smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children . Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , Mrs. Suckling 's own family , and Mrs. Bragge 's ; but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove . "
Jane Fairfax	decided	She would not let Jane say , ` No ; ' for when Jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at Donwell , ) when Jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell 's return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over again -- and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than I did .

Jane Fairfax	sure	Poor old John , I have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty - seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed - ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints-- I must go and see him to - day ; and so will Jane , I am sure , 
Jane Fairfax	better	"And I hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long .

Jane Fairfax	well	""" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ; "" and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge 's at the time proposed .

Jane Fairfax	days	Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous.-- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted . 
Jane Fairfax	rival	No doubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane 's eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed . 
Jane Fairfax	creature	and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!--I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt-- I could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?-- Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature . 
Jane Fairfax	sure	And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ) , that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled . 
Frank Churchill	glad	We know , on the contrary , that he has so much of both , that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom . 
Frank Churchill	able	He may , at times , be able to do a great deal more than he can at others . 
Frank Churchill	sure	I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one 's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma . 
Frank Churchill	glad	I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother 's , it must have been a real indulgence . 
Frank Churchill	good	The Frank Churchill so long talked of , so high in interest , was actually before her -- he was presented to her , and she did not think too much had been said in his praise ; he was a _ very _ good looking young man ; height , air , address , all were unexceptionable , and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father 's ; he looked quick and sensible . 
Frank Churchill	deficient	If he were deficient there , nothing should make amends for it . 
Frank Churchill	interested	Their first pause was at the Crown Inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one of the sort , where a couple of pair of post - horses were kept , more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added ; it had been built many years ago for a ball - room , and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous , dancing state , had been occasionally used as such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away , and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half - gentlemen of the place . He was immediately interested . 
Frank Churchill	satisfied	The want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied . 
Frank Churchill	judge	He could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap . 
Frank Churchill	man	Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether . He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect . 
Frank Churchill	favourite	Frank Churchill came back again ; and if he kept his father 's dinner waiting , it was not known at Hartfield ; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse , to betray any imperfection which could be concealed . 
Frank Churchill	undaunted	"He had no reason to wish his hair longer , to conceal any confusion of face ; no reason to wish the money unspent , to improve his spirits . He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever ; and , after seeing him , Emma thus moralised to herself:-- "" I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way .

Frank Churchill	man	Mr. Knightley , he is _ not _ a trifling , silly young man . 
Frank Churchill	impatient	He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining - room-- hated sitting long -- was always the first to move when he could-- that his father , Mr. Knightley , Mr. Cox , and Mr. Cole , were left very busy over parish business -- that as long as he had staid , however , it had been pleasant enough , as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike , sensible men ; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether -- thought it so abundant in agreeable families-- that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much . She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire-- the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as Enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and 
Frank Churchill	rude	""" I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that I can not keep my eyes from her . "
Frank Churchill	so	` Oh ! ' said he , ` I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively . '--Which you know shewed him to be so very . . . . 
Frank Churchill	sure	I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell 's taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _ all _ _ that _ _ party _ would particularly prize . 
Frank Churchill	idea	Frank 's was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance . But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest . 
Frank Churchill	unreasonable	""" No , no , "" said she , "" you are quite unreasonable . "
Frank Churchill	sure	If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired -- but is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted ? 
Frank Churchill	subject	What strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to , was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration , a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion , joined to all the rest , made her think that she _ must _ be a little in love with him , in spite of every previous determination against it . 
Frank Churchill	diverted	How angry and how diverted he would be ! 
Frank Churchill	time	But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again , so near as town . They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us .

Frank Churchill	sort	Mr. Churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife 's : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence !

Philip Elton	person	Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet 's head .

"" convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield . CHAPTER VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet 's fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton 's being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet 's side , as there could be any occasion for .

Philip Elton	ready	She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed.--There was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible . 
Philip Elton	unhappy	""" I wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too . I hope he will not mind it so very much . "
Philip Elton	man	"Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain . "" Emma laughed and disclaimed . "
Philip Elton	sort	Elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of Highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match . He knows the value of a good income as well as any body . 
Philip Elton	man	He knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away . 
Philip Elton	attentive	He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives . 
Philip Elton	determined	Mr. Elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _ very _ _ particular _ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious . 
Philip Elton	afraid	"He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse""--he stopt a moment--""or Miss Smith could inspire him . "" "

Philip Elton	delightful	It was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room . For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself . It could be protracted no longer . She was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance . The lovers were standing together at one of the windows . It had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully . But it would not do ; he had not come to the point . He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious . 
Philip Elton	persons	Harriet , Mr. Elton , and Mr. Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr. Woodhouse 's habits and inclination being consulted in every thing . 
Philip Elton	rational	"With men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works . "" "" Mr. Elton 's manners are not perfect , "" replied Emma ; "" but where there is a wish to please , one ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great deal . "

Philip Elton	cheerful	Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her . 
Philip Elton	close	Emma 's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her . The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion . 
Philip Elton	anxious	"Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of "" Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!""-- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs. Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners . "
Philip Elton	person	She had frequently thought -- especially since his father 's marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _ were _ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition . 
Philip Elton	afraid	But at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on Harriet's -- more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint . He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _ promise _ _ him _ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her . She was vexed . It did appear -- there was no concealing it -- exactly like the pretence of being in love with her , instead of Harriet ; an inconstancy , if real , the most contemptible and abominable ! 
Philip Elton	sure	"I am sure of your kind support and aid . "" Emma saw Mrs. Weston 's surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose . "
Philip Elton	sorry	If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed!--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse ! who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near ! 
Philip Elton	alone	"The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton 's absenting himself . It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them,-- "" Ah ! "
Philip Elton	adoration	Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs. Goddard 's ; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth . 
Philip Elton	good	"To take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another . VOLUME II CHAPTER I Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in Emma 's opinion , had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day . She could not think that Harriet 's solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive-- "" Mr. Elton is so good to the poor ! "" she found something else must be done . "
Philip Elton	standard	"When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind .

Philip Elton	gallant	He had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection , and was just the happy man he ought to be ; talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and , with cordial , fearless smiles , now addressing all the young ladies of the place , to whom , a few weeks ago , he would have been more cautiously gallant .

Philip Elton	unlucky	"The woman was better off ; she might have the assistance of fine clothes , and the privilege of bashfulness , but the man had only his own good sense to depend on ; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married , the woman he had wanted to marry , and the woman whom he had been expected to marry , she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise , and to be as much affectedly , and as little really easy as could be . "" Well , Miss Woodhouse , "" said Harriet , when they had quitted the house , and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ; "
Philip Elton	superior	He is just as superior as ever;--but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing . 
Philip Elton	unpleasant	Her manners , too -- and Mr. Elton 's , were unpleasant towards Harriet . 
Philip Elton	near	When she was half - way up the set , the whole group were exactly behind her , and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch ; but Mr. Elton was so near , that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston ; and she perceived that his wife , who was standing immediately above her , was not only listening also , but even encouraging him by 
Philip Elton	sure	""" If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance , "" said he , "" I shall have great pleasure , I am sure -- for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert . "
Philip Elton	happy	Any thing else I should be most happy to do , at your command -- but my dancing days are over . 
Philip Elton	hardened	"Mr. Elton had retreated into the card - room , looking ( Emma trusted ) very foolish . She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her;--_she _ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner , "" Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very "

Philip Elton	hand	". E. is Knightley 's right hand . "" "
Anna Weston	object	Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem . Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful . 
Anna Weston	convinced	She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton 's being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already . 
Anna Weston	sanguine	I can not be so sanguine as Mr. Weston . 
Anna Weston	afraid	I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing . 
Anna Weston	disappointed	Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression . 
Anna Weston	person	Had she been a person of consequence herself , he would have come I dare say ; and it would not have signified whether he did or no . 
Anna Weston	ready	""" You can not see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings , "" said Emma ; "" were you to guess her to be _ eighteen _ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _ she _ would be ready to quarrel with you for using "
Anna Weston	fond	""" I am not fond of dinner - visiting , "" said he--""I never was . "
Anna Weston	sorry	I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it . I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to . 
Anna Weston	interested	Mrs. Weston , kind - hearted and musical , was particularly interested by the circumstance , and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine 's countenance . 
Anna Weston	glad	I was quite surprized;--very glad , I am sure ; but really quite surprized . Such a very kind attention -- and so thoughtful an attention!-- the sort of thing that so few men would think of .

Anna Weston	able	""" Well , "" said Mrs. Weston , smiling , "" you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again . The more I think of it , the more probable it appears . "
Anna Weston	sure	I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner . 
Anna Weston	aware	I was not aware of it myself . 
Anna Weston	support	I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston . 
Anna Weston	insincere	""" "" I do not believe any such thing , "" replied Emma.--""I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent . "
Anna Weston	player	And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too . I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England . 
Anna Weston	sorry	Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge . 
Anna Weston	afraid	Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage ; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper . 
Anna Weston	fond	I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk . 
Anna Weston	sure	She will enjoy the scheme , I am sure ; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties . 
Anna Weston	kind	I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me . She has been so kind as to promise it . 
Anna Weston	right	"We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to . "" "" You are right , Mrs. Weston , "" said Mr. Knightley warmly , "" Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton . "
Anna Weston	sure	Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable .

I certainly get better and better.--Now for it .

Anna Weston	uneasy.--	""" Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy.-- She had some fears of his horse . Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.-- A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question . "
Anna Weston	right	You are right . 
Anna Weston	apprehensive	"Emma pondered a moment , and then replied , "" I will not pretend _ not _ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of .

Anna Weston	sensible	The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been-- that had been -- hard for him to bear . ` I did not make the allowances , ' said she , ` which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits-- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first . ' She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good . She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself . 
Anna Weston	happy	""" "" If I did not know her to be happy now , "" said Emma , seriously , "" which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , I could not bear these thanks;--for , oh ! "
Anna Weston	happy	"I am sure she is very good-- I hope she will be very happy . It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers . "" Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston . She thought well of Frank in almost every respect ; and , what was more , she loved him very much , and her defence was , therefore , earnest . She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection-- but she had too much to urge for Emma 's attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs. Weston ended with , "" We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come , "" she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for .

Anna Weston	well	present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well . 
Anna Weston	mother	Mrs. Weston 's friends were all made happy by her safety ; and if the satisfaction of her well - doing could be increased to Emma , it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl . She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston . She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her , hereafter , with either of Isabella 's sons ; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best . 
Anna Weston	ready	To Emma 's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley 's , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion.-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs. Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one-- 
Anna Weston	alone	. Weston was alone in the drawing - room:-- but hardly had they been told of the baby , and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for coming , which he asked for , when a glimpse was caught through the blind , of two figures passing near the window .

Augusta Elton	woman	From Harriet 's happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father 's being present to engage Mr. Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady 's conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good .

Mr. Weston	man	"Mr. Weston is rather an easy , cheerful - tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , I suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords . "" Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass . "
Mr. Weston	favourite	Mr. Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself . She could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour 's uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each . 
Mr. Weston	confident	I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January , as I am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at Hartfield , that she can not calculate on their effects , as I have been long in the practice of doing .

Mr. Weston	able	For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that Frank 's coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner .

Mr. Weston	sure	It has been completely unexpected . That is , _ I _ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure 
Mr. Weston	severe	""" I hope , "" said he presently , "" I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill . "
Mr. Weston	sorry	If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish . 
Mr. Weston	ignorant	You can not be ignorant , Mrs. Elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment I have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her . 
Mr. Weston	delighted	He was quite delighted . 
Mr. Weston	superior.--	Mr. Weston might be his son 's superior.-- In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.-- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley 's not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself . His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body 's eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave . 
Mr. Weston	glad	I am glad he can afford it . 
Mr. Weston	aware	Now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton , of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton 's party ! 
Mr. Weston	glad	"I am glad you approve of what I have done , "" said he very comfortably . "

Mr. Weston	certain	You , ( to Emma ) , I am certain , will never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em - ma.--Do you understand ? 
Mr. Weston	silent	"For a moment he was silent ; and then added , in a tone much more guarded and demure , "" Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did . "" "
Mr. Weston	wrong	""" "" Nay , dear Emma , now I must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , I have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and-- "" "" Good God ! "" cried Emma , not attending to her.--""Mrs . Smallridge , too ! "
Mr. Weston	anxious	"Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement 's becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:-- but Mr. Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for "" such things , "" he observed , "" always got about . "" "
Mr. Weston	uneasy	Perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes 
Mr. Weston	favourite	Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend . 
Mr. Weston	man	Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain . 
Miss Bates	woman	And yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will . 
Miss Bates	talker	She was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip . 
Miss Bates	good	"This does not apply , however , to Miss Bates ; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me ; but , in general , she is very much to the taste of every body , though single and though poor . Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind : I really believe , if she had only a shilling in the world , she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it ; and nobody is afraid of her : that is a great charm . "" "" Dear me ! "

Miss Bates	favourite	yes -- Mr. Elton , I understand -- certainly as to dancing-- Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was-- Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of Jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , Jane is so very great a favourite there . Whenever she is with us , Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can . 
Miss Bates	sure	I am sure there is nobody 's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse 's . 
Miss Bates	kind	You are very kind . 
Miss Bates	sure	I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury , as they can be to see her . Yes , Friday or Saturday ; she can not say which , because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days .

Miss Bates	obliging	You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave .

Miss Bates	bewildered	Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates , and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte -- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand , but a large - sized square pianoforte ; and the substance of the story , the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations on her side , and explanations on Miss Bates 's , was , that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood 's the day before , to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at first , by Miss Bates 's account , Jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it-- but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell . 
Miss Bates	grateful	she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure . 
Miss Bates	mad	"And touching Miss Bates , who at that moment passed near--""Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ? "
Miss Bates	distressed	for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could . 
Miss Bates	likely	She is still nearer.-- And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body . 
Miss Bates	delight	""" She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing . "
Miss Bates	gratitude	""" She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing . "
Miss Bates	amusing	""" "" But she is so amusing , so extremely amusing ! "
Miss Bates	lesson	She is a standing lesson of how to be happy . 
Miss Bates	welcome	Most cordially , when Miss Bates arrived , did she agree that it must . As a counsellor she was not wanted ; but as an approver , ( a much safer character , ) she was truly welcome . 
Miss Bates	absent	I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates 's being absent . 
Miss Bates	woman	She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in . She is a woman that one may , that one _ must _ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight . 
Miss Bates	sure	My dear Jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two , but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely-- and there was a mat to step upon -- I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh ! 
Miss Bates	quiet	Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma ; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her.--He was thoughtful . 
Miss Bates	obliging	you are too obliging ! 
Miss Bates	obliging.--Is	My dear sir , you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am not helpless . 
Miss Bates	kind	Sir , you are most kind . 
Miss Bates	sure	""" Why , to own the truth , "" cried Miss Bates , who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes , "" if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days . "
Miss Bates	aware	At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware . 
Miss Bates	talker	I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not .

"" I am afraid Jane is not very well , "" said she , "" but I do not know ; they _ tell _ me she is well . "
Miss Bates	unpersuadable	Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in . 
Miss Bates	unhappy	Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons , the Mrs. Perrys , and the Mrs. Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself-- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece 's appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist . On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy , and very communicative ; Jane would hardly eat any thing:-- Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food ; but every thing they could command ( and never had any body such good neighbours ) was distasteful . 
Miss Bates	satisfied	"In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but "" dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing . "" "
Miss Bates	present	Was not she like a daughter , his eldest daughter?--he must tell her ; and Miss Bates being present , it passed , of course , to Mrs. Cole , Mrs. Perry , and Mrs. Elton , immediately afterwards . It was no more than the principals were prepared for ; they had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls , how soon it would be over Highbury ; and were thinking of themselves , as the evening wonder in many a family circle , with great sagacity . 
Miss Bates	fortunate	It is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , I suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , Miss Woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing her tears)--but , poor dear soul ! if you were to see what a headache she has . 
Miss Bates	low	She is as low as possible . 
Miss Bates	able	To look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation . You will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room-- I want her to lie down upon the bed . 
Miss Bates	well	But , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well .

Mr. Woodhouse	able	How they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter 's carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also . 
Mr. Woodhouse	comfortable	Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him ; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable . 
Mr. Woodhouse	ready	Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared . Mr. Weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation .

"" "" A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer ! "" "" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense . She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely "

Robert Martin	farthest	And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know . 
Robert Martin	brother	I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him . He was the brother of her friends , and he took pains to please her ; and altogether , having seen nobody better ( that must have been his great assistant ) she might not , while she was at Abbey - Mill , find him disagreeable . 
Robert Martin	sufficient	she was not so easily to be talked out of it . The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet 's mind was not to be talked away . He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her . Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love . 
Robert Martin	agreeable	""" She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be . "" "" She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there . "
Robert Martin	deserving	made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving . 
Robert Martin	first	Martin and Harriet Smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married . 
Isabella Knightley	near	The name makes me think of poor Isabella ; for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama . 
Isabella Knightley	sorry	""" "" I do not know , my dear -- but it is so long since she was here!--not since last Easter , and then only for a few days.--Mr . John Knightley 's being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly taken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here ! "" "
Isabella Knightley	tired	""" My poor dear Isabella , "" said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children--""How long it is , how terribly long since you were here ! And how tired you must be after your journey ! "
Isabella Knightley	happy	""" And she talked in this way so long and successfully that , when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister , she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella 's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax ; and Jane Fairfax , though no great favourite with her in general , she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising . "
Isabella Knightley	sure	""" Oh , Mrs. Churchill ; every body knows Mrs. Churchill , "" replied Isabella : "" and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion . "
Isabella Knightley	much	There was too much domestic happiness in his brother 's house ; woman wore too amiable a form in it ; Isabella was too much like Emma -- differing only in those striking inferiorities , which always brought the other in brilliancy before him , for much to have been done , even had his time been longer.--He had stayed on , however , vigorously , day after day -- till this very morning 's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then , with the gladness which must be felt , nay , which he did not scruple to feel , having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma , was there so much fond solicitude , so much keen anxiety for her , that he could stay no longer . He had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery . 
Isabella Knightley	observer	Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her . 
Isabella Knightley	woman	Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty , elegant little woman , of gentle , quiet manners , and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate ; wrapt up in her family ; a devoted wife , a doating mother , and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that , but for these higher ties , a warmer love might have seemed impossible . 
Isabella Knightley	woman	She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness ; and with this resemblance of her father , she inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in her own health , over - careful of that of her children , had many fears and many nerves , and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry . They were alike too , in a general benevolence of temper , and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance . 
Isabella Knightley	delighted	Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister 's side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable.-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse 's carriage.--It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square .

Mr. Perry	man	Mr. Perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse 's life ; and upon being applied to , he could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination ) that wedding - cake might certainly disagree with many -- perhaps with most people , unless taken moderately . 
Mr. Perry	sure	Mr. Perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must 
Mr. Perry	bilious	Poor Perry is bilious , and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country . 
Mr. Perry	pleased	"He will be so pleased to see my little ones . "" "" I hope he will be here to - morrow , for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence . "
Mr. Perry	liberal	If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr. Perry . The expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know . He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .

He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time . 
Mr. Perry	sort	""" Sir , "" said Mr. Woodhouse , rather warmly , "" you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character . "
Mr. Perry	concerned	"Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill . But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father 's house . "" "" From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir . "
Mr. Perry	uneasy	Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged-- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr. Perry was uneasy about her . 
Mrs. Bates	afraid	You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here . 
Mrs. Bates	able	Her father 's comfort was amply secured , Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs. Goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it . 
Mrs. Bates	able	The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs. Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte . Busy as he was , however , the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again . 
Mrs. Bates	afraid	"had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , "" Well , my dear , I shall _ say _ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough . "" Poor old Mrs. Bates , civil and humble as usual , looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on . "" I am afraid Jane is not very well , "" said she , "" but I do not know ; they _ tell _ me she is well . "
Mrs. Bates	able	I am very little able -- Have you a chair , ma'am ? 
Mrs. Bates	sure	"I am sure she will be here presently . "" Emma seriously hoped she would . She had a moment 's fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her . "
Mrs. Bates	kindness.--It	""" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness.--It is impossible to say -- "
Mrs. Bates	kind	""" You are extremely kind , "" replied Miss Bates , highly gratified ; "" you who are such a judge , and write so beautifully yourself . "
Mrs. Bates	uneasy	The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy . 
Mrs. Bates	disappointed	Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus-- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned!--Well , this is brilliant ! I am all amazement ! 
Mrs. Cole	kind	yes -- Mr. Elton , I understand -- certainly as to dancing-- Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was-- Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of Jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , Jane is so very great a favourite there . Whenever she is with us , Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can . 
Mrs. Cole	kind	"You are so kind ! "" replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter.--""Oh ! "
Mrs. Cole	better	and , Jane , you had better go home directly -- I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already .
