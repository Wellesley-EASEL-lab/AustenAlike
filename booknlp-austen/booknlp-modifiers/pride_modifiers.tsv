Character	Modifier	Context
Elizabeth Bennet	better	Lizzy is not a bit better than the others : and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good - humoured as Lydia . 
Elizabeth Bennet	handsome	Lizzy is not a bit better than the others : and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good - humoured as Lydia . 
Elizabeth Bennet	alone	When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	girl	Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so ; but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of . 
Elizabeth Bennet	determined	When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . ” “ Your plan is a good one , ” replied Elizabeth , “ where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	pretty	You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . ” Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley ’s attention to her sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend . Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty : he had looked at her without admiration at the ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise . 
Elizabeth Bennet	unaware	Of this she was perfectly unaware : to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . 
Elizabeth Bennet	creature	“ You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	invaluable	If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable ; but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	determined	Elizabeth was determined ; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion . 
Elizabeth Bennet	favourite	How long has she been such a favourite ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	serious	“ Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . 
Elizabeth Bennet	afraid	“ Oh , I am not at all afraid of her dying . 
Elizabeth Bennet	horsewoman	Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had : and as she was no horsewoman , walking was her only alternative . 
Elizabeth Bennet	silly	“ How can you be so silly , ” cried her mother , “ as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	fit	You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	glad	Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , 
Elizabeth Bennet	great	She is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else . ” “ I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , ” cried Elizabeth ; “ I am _ not _ a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . ” “ In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , ” said Bingley ; “ and 
Elizabeth Bennet	ill	“ She is a great deal too ill to be moved . 
Elizabeth Bennet	ill	“ I am sure , ” she added , “ if it was not for such good friends , I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , 
Elizabeth Bennet	object	She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man , and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange . 
Elizabeth Bennet	amazed	Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody , and Darcy had 
Elizabeth Bennet	surprised	Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . 
Elizabeth Bennet	conscious	“ You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ’s confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking : if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	impatient	I am impatient to see him . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	woman	Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers , Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin . 
Elizabeth Bennet	willing	, she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for anyone in particular . Allowing for the common demands of the game , Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy . 
Elizabeth Bennet	surprised	“ You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . 
Elizabeth Bennet	deep	Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , “ To treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father ! ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	surprised	Elizabeth ’s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley ’s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ’s amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke , either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance . 
Elizabeth Bennet	able	, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice . 
Elizabeth Bennet	delighted	They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and , with an expression of civil disdain , thus accosted her,-- “ So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	satisfied	I am perfectly satisfied . 
Elizabeth Bennet	afraid	Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth , sorry for her , and sorry for her father ’s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . 
Elizabeth Bennet	free	She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy ’s further notice : though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . 
Elizabeth Bennet	dear	Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _ her _ , the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield . [ Illustration : “ to assure you in the most animated language ” ] CHAPTER XIX . The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sure	I am sure Lizzy will be very happy -- I am sure she can have no objection . 
Elizabeth Bennet	happy	I am sure Lizzy will be very happy -- I am sure she can have no objection . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sure	I am sure Lizzy will be very happy -- I am sure she can have no objection . 
Elizabeth Bennet	serious	I am perfectly serious in my refusal . 
Elizabeth Bennet	woman	You could not make _ me _ happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _ you _ so . 
Elizabeth Bennet	charming	Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . ” “ You are uniformly charming ! ” cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry ; “ and I am persuaded that , when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . 
Elizabeth Bennet	girl	She is a very headstrong , foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will _ make _ her know it . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	headstrong	“ Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . 
Elizabeth Bennet	obliged	“ It keeps him in good humour , ” said she , “ and I am more obliged to you than I can express . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	surprised	The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied,-- “ Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	surprised	“ I see what you are feeling , ” replied Charlotte ; “ you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you . But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sure	In the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and , fourthly , that the match might be broken off . 
Elizabeth Bennet	cause	Two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole : one , that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sure	Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . 
Elizabeth Bennet	comfortable	Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . 
Elizabeth Bennet	dissatisfied	The more I see of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . 
Elizabeth Bennet	creature	Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of Hertfordshire : her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes ; but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . 
Elizabeth Bennet	circumstances	Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of Hertfordshire : her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes ; but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . 
Elizabeth Bennet	pleased	Change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything . ” Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ’s ready acquiescence . 
Elizabeth Bennet	girl	Mrs. Gardiner ’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone : after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on:-- “ You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . 
Elizabeth Bennet	serious	“ Elizabeth , you are not serious now . ” “ I beg your pardon . 
Elizabeth Bennet	welcome	Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . 
Elizabeth Bennet	incapable	The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt:-- “ My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ’s regard for me . 
Elizabeth Bennet	watchful	Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . 
Elizabeth Bennet	choice	Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _ she _ would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	ready	The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear - sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte ’s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and , while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy . 
Elizabeth Bennet	first	His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of everybody -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest , which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that , whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . Her fellow - travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . 
Elizabeth Bennet	grieved	Their first subject was her sister ; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute inquiries , that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sick	I am sick of them all . 
Elizabeth Bennet	satisfied	Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . 
Elizabeth Bennet	able	But though everything seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend , that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion . 
Elizabeth Bennet	ready	Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime . 
Elizabeth Bennet	families	It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way . 
Elizabeth Bennet	glad	I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . 
Elizabeth Bennet	creature	Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . 
Elizabeth Bennet	thankful	While Sir William was with them , Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and showing him the country : but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration ; for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sensible	She was perfectly sensible that he never had : but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 
Elizabeth Bennet	alarmed	But I will not be alarmed , though your sister _ does _ play so well . 
Elizabeth Bennet	unlucky	I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sorry	I am sorry to pain you , but so it was . 
Elizabeth Bennet	right	Darcy smiled and said , “ You are perfectly right . 
Elizabeth Bennet	afraid	She was afraid of talking longer of his friend ; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	pleased	The gentleman experienced some change of feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice,-- “ Are you pleased with Kent ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	glad	It distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage . 
Elizabeth Bennet	unwell	seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her ; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine ’s being rather displeased by her staying at home . CHAPTER XXXIV . When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent . 
Elizabeth Bennet	better	In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better . 
Elizabeth Bennet	surprised	Elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word . 
Elizabeth Bennet	insensible	In spite of her deeply - rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ’s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sorry	In spite of her deeply - rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ’s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sorry	I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone . 
Elizabeth Bennet	uncivil	Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I _ was _ uncivil ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	unequal	She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine ’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte ’s observation , and hurried her away to her room . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sorry	If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours , I can only say that I am sorry . 
Elizabeth Bennet	desirous	That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain ; but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears . 
Elizabeth Bennet	certain	He left Netherfield for London on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . 
Elizabeth Bennet	ignorant	Of what he has _ particularly _ accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . 
Elizabeth Bennet	happy	She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	master	But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . 
Elizabeth Bennet	alone	Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours : whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . Mr. Darcy ’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart . 
Elizabeth Bennet	full	When she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation : but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . 
Elizabeth Bennet	eager	Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sorry	She was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprang . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sorry	She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ’s refusal must have given him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sorry	“ Indeed , ” replied Elizabeth , “ I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . 
Elizabeth Bennet	wrong	“ No -- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	able	“ This will not do , ” said Elizabeth ; “ you never will be able to make both of them good for anything . 
Elizabeth Bennet	satisfied	Take your choice , but you must be satisfied 
Elizabeth Bennet	sensible	Here was knowledge in which no one could partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery . 
Elizabeth Bennet	able	“ And then , ” said she , “ if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	disposed	She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy ’s objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sure	“ If you were aware , ” said Elizabeth , “ of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ’s unguarded and imprudent manner , nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . ” “ Already arisen ! ” repeated Mr. Bennet . 
Elizabeth Bennet	confident	She was confident of having performed her duty ; and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition . 
Elizabeth Bennet	blind	Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ’s behaviour as a husband . 
Elizabeth Bennet	distressed	Elizabeth was distressed . 
Elizabeth Bennet	mistress	The rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine,--with less of splendour , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings . “ And of this place , ” thought she , “ I might have been mistress ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	rejoiced	How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	sure	Elizabeth could not help saying , “ It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	lucky	You are lucky in having such a master . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	sure	Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw anything of it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sensible	They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching : but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . 
Elizabeth Bennet	dear	She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of everything , she was still dear to him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	prepared	Elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . 
Elizabeth Bennet	unprepared	This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	impossible	Elizabeth was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and pleased . 
Elizabeth Bennet	amazed	She was quite amazed at her own discomposure ; but , amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in 
Elizabeth Bennet	sure	She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre - possessed in her favour . 
Elizabeth Bennet	satisfied	On this point she was soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of Jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . He observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it “ was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; ” and , before she could reply , he added , “ It is above eight months . 
Elizabeth Bennet	pleased	Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether _ all _ her sisters were at Longbourn . 
Elizabeth Bennet	pleased	Elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little . 
Elizabeth Bennet	grateful	She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his 
Elizabeth Bennet	sorry	Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without calling her attention . This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much : her own thoughts were employing her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	beauty	He was resolutely silent , however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued,-- “ I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ‘ _ She _ a beauty ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	disappointed	Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but 
Elizabeth Bennet	surprised	Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . 
Elizabeth Bennet	able	I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . 
Elizabeth Bennet	ill	You are very ill . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	well	I am quite well , I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	ignorant	Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sanguine	It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information ; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . 
Elizabeth Bennet	involved	And this consideration leads me , moreover , to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last November ; for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . 
Elizabeth Bennet	afraid	I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . 
Elizabeth Bennet	happy	The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . 
Elizabeth Bennet	afraid	Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sorry	Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot . 
Elizabeth Bennet	happy	She was convinced that she could have been happy with him , when it was no longer likely they should meet . 
Elizabeth Bennet	surprised	Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme ; and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . 
Elizabeth Bennet	disgusted	Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked . 
Elizabeth Bennet	strange	You are so strange ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	afraid	I was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . 
Elizabeth Bennet	so	Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day . 
Elizabeth Bennet	satisfied	Conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain ; but she was satisfied with none . 
Elizabeth Bennet	glad	Jane ’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . 
Elizabeth Bennet	likely	She was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . 
Elizabeth Bennet	ashamed	She was ashamed to think how much . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sensible	She was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	pleased	Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sure	“ Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	foolish	How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	satisfied	I am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	cruel	“ You are very cruel , ” said her sister , “ you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . ” “ How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	creature	Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure ; and , instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . 
Elizabeth Bennet	pleased	Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend ; for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . 
Elizabeth Bennet	puzzled	But no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled . 
Elizabeth Bennet	person	“ If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . ” “ Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	sensible	If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	undetermined	The colour now rushed into Elizabeth ’s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself , when her father continued,-- “ You look conscious . 
Elizabeth Bennet	rector	It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . 
Elizabeth Bennet	generous	After a short pause , her companion added , “ You are too generous to trifle with me . 
Elizabeth Bennet	importance	Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes , she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him : but though she could not look she could listen ; and he told her of feelings which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . 
Elizabeth Bennet	ashamed	I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	happy	Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _ knew _ that she was happy than _ felt _ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . 
Elizabeth Bennet	aware	She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known : she was aware that no one liked him but Jane ; and even feared that with the others it was a _ dislike _ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . 
Elizabeth Bennet	incredulous	Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet ’s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sure	My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . 
Elizabeth Bennet	certain	“ My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	certain	“ My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	happy	“ My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	pleased	But are you pleased , Jane ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	sure	Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	afraid	I am afraid you will be angry . ” “ My dearest sister , now be , _ be _ serious . 
Elizabeth Bennet	angry	I am afraid you will be angry . ” “ My dearest sister , now be , _ be _ serious . 
Elizabeth Bennet	happy	“ Now I am quite happy , ” said she , “ for you will be as happy as myself . 
Elizabeth Bennet	reserved	But , Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . 
Elizabeth Bennet	unwilling	She had been unwilling to mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend : but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia ’s marriage . 
Elizabeth Bennet	happy	I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband , unless you looked up to him as a superior . 
Elizabeth Bennet	earnest	Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and , at length , by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months ’ suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ’s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . 
Elizabeth Bennet	solemn	Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; and , at length , by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months ’ suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ’s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . 
Elizabeth Bennet	able	Elizabeth ’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after half an hour ’s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . 
Elizabeth Bennet	great	how rich and how great you will be ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	sick	The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . 
Elizabeth Bennet	grave	Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? ” “ Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . ” “ But I was embarrassed . ” “ And so was I. ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	silent	Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? ” “ Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . ” “ But I was embarrassed . ” “ And so was I. ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	embarrassed	Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? ” “ Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . ” “ But I was embarrassed . ” “ And so was I. ” 
Elizabeth Bennet	reasonable	“ You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . ” “ A man who had felt less might . ” “ How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! 
Elizabeth Bennet	afraid	Too much _ , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? 
Elizabeth Bennet	indebted	I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . 
Elizabeth Bennet	likely	, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . ” “ Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her ? ” “ I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . 
Elizabeth Bennet	happy	If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . 
Elizabeth Bennet	sure	I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much ; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . 
Elizabeth Bennet	glad	I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	man	He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and everybody hoped that he would never come there again . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	superior	In understanding , Darcy was the superior . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	clever	Bingley was by no means deficient ; but Darcy was clever . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	haughty	He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious ; and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	reserved	He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious ; and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	worth	“ Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	man	“ I beg you will not put it into Lizzy ’s head to be vexed by his ill - treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	man	Of this she was perfectly unaware : to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	fond	“ I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself , for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	sure	You can not refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	politeness	“ Mr. Darcy is all politeness , ” said Elizabeth , smiling . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	mistaken	“ You are mistaken . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	fellow	I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	glad	He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation ; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was “ very glad ; ” but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley ’s salutation . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	full	He was full of joy and attention . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	awake	He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	safe	You are safe from me . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	sorry	Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the pianoforte was opened ; and Darcy , after a few moments ’ recollection , was not sorry for it . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	man	, added , “ he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	likely	“ I wonder , ” said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , “ whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	godfather	He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	proud	If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it . ” “ It _ is _ wonderful , ” replied Wickham ; “ for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	proud	Family pride , and _ filial _ pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	companion	He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	minded	His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and , perhaps , agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	unworthy	Jane listened with astonishment and concern : she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	answerable	This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth ; and , as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham ’s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to Wickham . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	man	I have nothing to say against _ him _ : he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	fortunate	She was perfectly sensible that he never had : but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	surprised	” “ I should not be surprised , ” said Darcy , “ if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	sure	“ I believe she did -- and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	certain	My friend has an excellent understanding -- though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	rich	It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	cause	If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , _ he _ was the cause -- his pride and caprice were the cause -- of all that Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	able	Mr. Darcy ’s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister ’s sufferings . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	eloquent	He spoke well ; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	means	you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	ashamed	Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	sure	“ His being so sure of succeeding was wrong , ” said she , “ and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	sorry	He is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	anxious	He is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	fond	He was very fond of them . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	civil	Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _ that _ in his voice , which was not like ease . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	superior	The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	behaved	“ He is perfectly well - behaved , polite , and unassuming , ” said her uncle . “ There _ is _ something a little stately in him , to be sure , ” replied her aunt ; “ but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	polite	“ He is perfectly well - behaved , polite , and unassuming , ” said her uncle . “ There _ is _ something a little stately in him , to be sure , ” replied her aunt ; “ but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	handsome	“ To be sure , Lizzy , ” said her aunt , “ he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ’s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	whimsical	“ But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , ” replied her uncle . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	liberal	But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and _ that _ , in the eye of a servant , comprehends every virtue . ” 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	time	He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river ; and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	uppermost	In Darcy ’s presence she dared not mention Wickham ’s name : but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ’s distress ; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	silent	He was resolutely silent , however ; and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued,-- “ I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ‘ _ She _ a beauty ! 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	grieved	“ I am grieved , indeed , ” cried Darcy : “ grieved -- shocked . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	afraid	But I knew not -- I was afraid of doing too much . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	generous	He was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	mortal	But while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	man	She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	explicit	But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	sure	If he _ had another _ motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	defect	I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	sure	Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	satisfied	_ He _ was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _ her _ behaviour while she stayed with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ’s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	sure	If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	punctual	Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return , and , as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	bold	Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him ? 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	presuming	Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	happy	I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	wrong	It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could perhaps believe , that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	able	For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him,--proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	pleasing	She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . “ He could be still amiable , still pleasing to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	honour	If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	inclination	If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	man	_ Mr. Darcy _ , you see , is the man ! 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	sorry	“ I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , ” replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , “ that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	angry	I was angry , perhaps , at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	afraid	“ I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	mean	“ My object _ then _ , ” replied Darcy , “ was to show you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	cross	From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been overrated , Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner ’s long letter ; but now , having _ that _ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows:-- “ I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write . 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	silly	How could I be so silly as to wish it ! 
Fitzwilliam Darcy	happier	I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . 
Jane Bennet	gratified	Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be , though in a quieter way . 
Jane Bennet	admired	Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . 
Jane Bennet	creature	Only think of _ that _ , my dear : he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . 
Jane Bennet	alone	When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . 
Jane Bennet	pretty	He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . 
Jane Bennet	apt	“ Dear Lizzy ! ” “ Oh , you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . 
Jane Bennet	mistaken	Miss Bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . 
Jane Bennet	simpleton	If _ I _ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . ” 
Jane Bennet	secure	When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . ” “ Your plan is a good one , ” replied Elizabeth , “ where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . 
Jane Bennet	sure	“ That would be a good scheme , ” said Elizabeth , “ if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . ” 
Jane Bennet	equal	She was not equal , however , to much conversation ; and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . 
Jane Bennet	better	Jane was by no means better . 
Jane Bennet	well	“ Oh yes -- it would be much better to wait till Jane was well ; and by that time , most likely , Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . 
Jane Bennet	object	They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object ; Miss Bingley ’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . 
Jane Bennet	firm	The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . 
Jane Bennet	right	The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered ; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . 
Jane Bennet	sorry	Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour , of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account , as well as his sister ’s , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . 
Jane Bennet	afraid	I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy ’s regard . ” 
Jane Bennet	wrong	With all these circumstances to favour an attachment , and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? ’ 
Jane Bennet	sister	Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ’s indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard . 
Jane Bennet	different	“ Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . 
Jane Bennet	sure	can doubt his affection ; Miss Bingley , I am sure , can not : she is not such a simpleton . 
Jane Bennet	happy	“ But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? ” “ You must decide for yourself , ” said Elizabeth ; “ and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you , by all means , to refuse him . ” “ How can you talk so ? ” said Jane , faintly smiling ; “ you must know , that , though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . ” “ I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I can not consider your situation with much compassion . ” “ But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . 
Jane Bennet	comfortable	Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . 
Jane Bennet	desirous	As for Jane , _ her _ anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth ’s : but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing ; and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to . 
Jane Bennet	sure	The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill - humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . 
Jane Bennet	survivor	Let us flatter ourselves that _ I _ may be the survivor . ” 
Jane Bennet	thankful	“ Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . ” “ I never can be thankful , Mr. Bennet , for anything about the entail . 
Jane Bennet	good	“ My dear Jane , ” exclaimed Elizabeth , “ you are too good . 
Jane Bennet	ashamed	I am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . 
Jane Bennet	wife	it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins ’s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . 
Jane Bennet	able	_ She _ will not be able to help calling . ” 
Jane Bennet	right	I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . 
Jane Bennet	blind	She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley ’s inattention . 
Jane Bennet	sure	The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt:-- “ My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ’s regard for me . 
Jane Bennet	sure	I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but , if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . 
Jane Bennet	wrong	She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . 
Jane Bennet	sure	But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . 
Jane Bennet	certain	He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . 
Jane Bennet	afraid	If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . 
Jane Bennet	sure	I am sure you will be very comfortable there . “ Yours , etc . ” This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned , as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least . 
Jane Bennet	able	To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate , and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister further . CHAPTER XXXIX . It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ---- , in Hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet ’s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ’s punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room upstairs . 
Jane Bennet	maid	Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . 
Jane Bennet	sure	It is really too distressing , I am sure you must feel it so . ” 
Jane Bennet	sure	“ Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . ” 
Jane Bennet	uncomfortable	I was uncomfortable enough , I was very uncomfortable -- I may say unhappy . 
Jane Bennet	weak	And with no one to speak to of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me , and say that I had not been so very weak , and vain , and nonsensical , as I knew I had ! 
Jane Bennet	equal	I am not equal to it . 
Jane Bennet	right	At present I will say nothing about it . ” “ You are quite right . 
Jane Bennet	happy	Jane was not happy . 
Jane Bennet	ready	When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . 
Jane Bennet	eager	In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to satisfy . 
Jane Bennet	ashamed	I am only ashamed of his asking so little . ” 
Jane Bennet	sure	An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . 
Jane Bennet	distressed	Her father lifted up his eyes , Jane was distressed , Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia ; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued,-- “ Oh , mamma , do the people hereabouts know I am married to - day ? 
Jane Bennet	Happy	Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over ! ” 
Jane Bennet	secure	The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken ; but she would not be secure . 
Jane Bennet	anxious	When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little , but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good - natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever ; but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days ’ time . 
Jane Bennet	silent	When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little , but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good - natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever ; but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days ’ time . 
Jane Bennet	woman	You will be a very happy woman . ” 
Jane Bennet	girl	“ You are a good girl , ” he replied , “ and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . 
Jane Bennet	able	Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense . 
Jane Bennet	indifferent	“ Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ? ” “ He made a little mistake , to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . ” 
Jane Bennet	creature	“ I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! ” cried Jane . 
Jane Bennet	sure	It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills . 
William Collins	punctual	Mr. Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . 
William Collins	kind	This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers ; but Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily,-- “ You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough . 
William Collins	eloquent	Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise . 
William Collins	man	Mr. Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance . 
William Collins	sure	In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there : his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk ; and Mr. Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go . 
William Collins	struck	When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification ; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine ’s drawing - rooms , and found that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ’s room . 
William Collins	silent	there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent . 
William Collins	fortunate	On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr. Collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation , that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . 
William Collins	thankful	I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . 
William Collins	pleased	Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . 
William Collins	fortunate	“ If I , ” said Mr. Collins , “ were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . 
William Collins	sure	“ If I , ” said Mr. Collins , “ were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . 
William Collins	indifferent	He assured her that , as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; that his chief object was , by delicate attentions , to recommend himself to her ; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . There was no arguing upon such a project . 
William Collins	indifferent	To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents . , which will not be yours till after your mother ’s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . 
William Collins	silent	On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent : and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . 
William Collins	circumstances	My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into further consideration that , in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . 
William Collins	sensible	Mr. Collins , to be sure , was neither sensible nor agreeable : his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . 
William Collins	agreeable	Mr. Collins , to be sure , was neither sensible nor agreeable : his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . 
William Collins	able	Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman ’s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? 
William Collins	happy	Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman ’s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? 
William Collins	sure	In the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and , fourthly , that the match might be broken off . 
William Collins	happy	He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; and , luckily for the others , the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company . 
William Collins	man	My dear Jane , Mr. Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man : you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him can not have a proper way of thinking . 
William Collins	less	Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect : but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement . 
William Collins	gratified	Mr. Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,-- “ It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . 
George Wickham	man	Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers , Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin . 
George Wickham	glad	“ I know little of the game at present , ” said he , “ but I shall be glad to improve myself ; for in my situation of life---- ” 
George Wickham	qualified	I am not qualified to form one . 
George Wickham	man	I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . 
George Wickham	amiable	She could have added , “ A young man , too , like _ you _ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable . ” 
George Wickham	partner	, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was , at any rate , a ball . 
George Wickham	present	Till Elizabeth entered the drawing - room at Netherfield , and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . 
George Wickham	capable	At length Darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said,-- “ Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his _ making _ friends ; whether he may be equally capable of _ retaining _ them , is less certain . ” 
George Wickham	likely	“ He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , ” replied Elizabeth , with emphasis , “ and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . ” 
George Wickham	imprudent	I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy ’s regard . ” 
George Wickham	fellow	He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . ” “ Thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . 
George Wickham	little	They had , therefore , many acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy ’s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring . Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well . 
George Wickham	model	His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of everybody -- would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest , which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , that , whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . Her fellow - travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . 
George Wickham	mercenary	_ He _ shall be mercenary , and _ she _ shall be foolish . ” 
George Wickham	son	Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ; and on George Wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ’s education .

My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ’s education . 
George Wickham	sincere	I rather wished than believed him to be sincere ; but , at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . 
George Wickham	violent	His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself . 
George Wickham	consequence	His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at anything . 
George Wickham	safe	Wickham is safe . ” 
George Wickham	man	He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but , with a moment ’s recollection , and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often ; and , after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man , asked her how she had liked him . 
George Wickham	much	“ In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . ” 
George Wickham	silent	” Wickham ’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents,-- “ You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right . 
George Wickham	wise	” Wickham ’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents,-- “ You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right . 
George Wickham	certain	His fear of her has always operated , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . 
George Wickham	profligate	We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . 
George Wickham	false	We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . 
George Wickham	deceitful	We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . 
George Wickham	undeserving	“ Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him , ” said her sister . 
George Wickham	distressed	Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself ; but his manners were always so pleasing , that , had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . 
George Wickham	man	She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . Lydia was exceedingly fond of him . 
George Wickham	angry	“ Thank you , ” said Lydia ; “ for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be so angry . ” On such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . 
George Wickham	likely	Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . 
George Wickham	afraid	“ I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? ” said he , as he joined her . “ You certainly do , ” she replied with a smile ; “ but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . ” 
George Wickham	sorry	“ I should be sorry , indeed , if it were . 
George Wickham	surprised	Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him ; but he soon afterwards said,-- “ I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . 
George Wickham	glad	I am very glad you liked her . 
George Wickham	satisfied	Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . 
George Wickham	fellow	“ He is as fine a fellow , ” said Mr. Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , “ as ever I saw . 
Charles Bingley	young	He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and , to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . 
Charles Bingley	handsome	He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and , to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party . 
Charles Bingley	looking	Mr. Bingley was good - looking and gentlemanlike : he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . 
Charles Bingley	gentlemanlike	Mr. Bingley was good - looking and gentlemanlike : he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . 
Charles Bingley	figure	The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and

Charles Bingley	lively	Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room : he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . 
Charles Bingley	unreserved	Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room : he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield . 
Charles Bingley	fastidious	“ I would not be so fastidious as you are , ” cried Bingley , “ for a kingdom ! 
Charles Bingley	man	“ But I can assure you , ” she added , “ that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _ his _ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . 
Charles Bingley	lively	“ He is just what a young - man ought to be , ” said she , “ sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! ” “ He is also handsome , ” replied Elizabeth , “ which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can . 
Charles Bingley	handsome	“ He is just what a young - man ought to be , ” said she , “ sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! ” “ He is also handsome , ” replied Elizabeth , “ which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can . 
Charles Bingley	agreeable	Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . 
Charles Bingley	sure	I scarcely know any one who can not do all this ; and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . ” “ Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , ” said Darcy , “ has too much truth . 
Charles Bingley	happy	They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . ” 
Charles Bingley	civil	Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . 
Charles Bingley	ready	“ I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and , when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball . 
Charles Bingley	gratified	“ I am exceedingly gratified , ” said Bingley , “ by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . 
Charles Bingley	afraid	But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me if , under such a circumstance , I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could . ” 
Charles Bingley	spokesman	Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object . 
Charles Bingley	object	Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the principal object . 
Charles Bingley	man	“ He is a sweet - tempered , amiable , charming man . 
Charles Bingley	unacquainted	Mr. Bingley ’s defence of his friend was a very able one , I dare say ; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . ” She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . 
Charles Bingley	_	I believe him to be Lady Catherine ’s _ nephew _ . 
Charles Bingley	nephew	I believe him to be Lady Catherine ’s _ nephew _ . 
Charles Bingley	grateful	Bingley was all grateful pleasure ; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time . 
Charles Bingley	indifferent	Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood . Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was indifferent -- but that 
Charles Bingley	in	It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . ” 
Charles Bingley	person	But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . 
Charles Bingley	unsuspicious	He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister ’s attachment ; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte ’s opinion had always been . 
Charles Bingley	personage	To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself . 
Charles Bingley	ready	Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 
Charles Bingley	welcome	But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . 
Charles Bingley	welcome	Well , any friend of Mr. Bingley ’s will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else I must 
Charles Bingley	happy	I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the coveys for you . ” 
Charles Bingley	happy	“ Next time you call , ” said she , “ I hope we shall be more lucky . ” He should be particularly happy at any time , etc . , etc . ; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . 
Charles Bingley	punctual	Bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . 
Charles Bingley	communicative	There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric , than the other had ever seen him . 
Charles Bingley	eccentric	There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric , than the other had ever seen him . 
Charles Bingley	short	In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . 
Charles Bingley	lover	They shook hands with great cordiality ; and then , till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness , and of Jane ’s perfections ; and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super - excellent disposition of Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . 
Charles Bingley	visitor	Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . 
Charles Bingley	present	Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister ; for while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else : but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . 
Charles Bingley	modest	Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . 
Charles Bingley	angry	I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . He was angry . 
Charles Bingley	delightful	Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked herself . She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at , and it was rather too early to begin . 
Charles Bingley	sure	It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . ” “ It may do very well for the others , ” replied Mr. Bingley ; “ but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . 
Charles Bingley	simpleton	If _ I _ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . ” 
Charles Bingley	well	He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him . 
Charles Bingley	gentlemanlike	Their brother is a pleasant , gentlemanlike man -- he is a great friend of Darcy ’s . ” 
Charles Bingley	friend	Their brother is a pleasant , gentlemanlike man -- he is a great friend of Darcy ’s . ” 
Charles Bingley	happy	But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again : though we can never be what we once were to each other . ” 
Charles Bingley	severe	I rather wonder now at your knowing _ any _ . ” “ Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this ? ” “ _ I _ never saw such a woman . 
Charles Bingley	serious	She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when , hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said,-- “ By the bye Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? 
Charles Bingley	master	It must be his own doing ; he is his own master . 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . 
Mrs. Bennet	pleased	Well , how pleased I am ! 
Mrs. Bennet	delighted	“ Oh , my dear , ” continued Mrs. Bennet , “ I am quite delighted with him . 
Mrs. Bennet	choice	“ _ You _ were Mr. Bingley ’s first choice . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	_ ] ] “ Are you quite sure , ma’am ? Is not there a little mistake ? ” said Jane . 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	“ But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure . 
Mrs. Bennet	aware	, however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . 
Mrs. Bennet	miserable	Had she found Jane in any apparent danger , Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield . 
Mrs. Bennet	profuse	Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments . 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	“ I am sure , ” she added , “ if it was not for such good friends , I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , 
Mrs. Bennet	satisfied	She performed her part , indeed , without much graciousness , but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . 
Mrs. Bennet	impatient	Her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to Elizabeth ’s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	I know of nobody that is coming , I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in ; and I hope _ my _ dinners are good enough for her . 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	It is Mr. Bingley , I am sure . 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley . 
Mrs. Bennet	glad	Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley . 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	“ It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , ” said Mr. Bennet ; “ and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . But if you will listen to his letter , you may , perhaps , be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . ” “ No , that I am sure I shall not : and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . 
Mrs. Bennet	fortunate	but , for some time , I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance . ”--‘There , Mrs. Bennet . ’--“My mind , however , is now made up on the subject ; for , having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England . As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . 
Mrs. Bennet	concerned	I can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologize for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends ; but of this hereafter . 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers ; but Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily,-- “ You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough . 
Mrs. Bennet	sensible	“ I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . 
Mrs. Bennet	cautious	“ I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . 
Mrs. Bennet	pleased	She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	“ That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . 
Mrs. Bennet	woman	“ That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . 
Mrs. Bennet	widow	“ I think you said she was a widow , sir ? 
Mrs. Bennet	better	“ Ah , ” cried Mrs. Bennet , shaking her head , “ then she is better off than many girls . 
Mrs. Bennet	sort	And what sort of young lady is she ? 
Mrs. Bennet	handsome	Is she handsome ? ” 
Mrs. Bennet	lady	“ She is a most charming young lady , indeed . 
Mrs. Bennet	amiable	But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	happy	Her Ladyship seemed pleased with the idea ; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . 
Mrs. Bennet	satisfied	Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages , and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months . 
Mrs. Bennet	glad	This information , however , startled Mrs. Bennet : she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not believe it , and could not help saying so . 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	I will go directly to Mr. Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . ” She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out , as she entered the library,-- “ Oh , Mr. Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins , for she vows she will not have him ; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _ her _ . ” Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern , which was not in the least altered by her communication . “ I have not the pleasure of understanding you , ” said he , when she had finished her speech . 
Mrs. Bennet	alone	] Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty , who came to tell the same news ; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room , where Mrs. Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her family . 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead . 
Mrs. Bennet	able	_ I _ shall not be able to keep you -- and so I warn you . 
Mrs. Bennet	sorry	I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . 
Mrs. Bennet	glad	However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	resigned	His marriage was now fast approaching ; and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say , in an ill - natured tone , that she “ _ wished _ they might be happy . ” 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . 
Mrs. Bennet	able	“ If I had been able , ” said she , “ to carry my point in going to Brighton with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened : but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . 
Mrs. Bennet	guilty	And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . 
Mrs. Bennet	certain	Mrs. Bennet , for many years after Lydia ’s birth , had been certain that he would . 
Mrs. Bennet	alive	She was more alive to the disgrace , which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ’s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place . 
Mrs. Bennet	sure	He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . 
Mrs. Bennet	mindful	When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little , but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . He found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good - natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever ; but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days ’ time . 
Mrs. Bennet	inclined	Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year . 
Mrs. Bennet	happy	“ If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you . 
Mrs. Bennet	privileged	Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton . 
Mrs. Bennet	sorry	As she went upstairs to get ready , Mrs. Bennet followed her , saying,-- “ I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but I hope you will not mind it . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	fortunate	Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	disconcerted	Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London . “ I am astonished , my dear , ” said Mrs. Bennet , “ that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	so	“ He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and , I doubt not , will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . ” 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	aunt	“ You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy . ” 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	patroness	“ Mr. Collins , ” said she , “ speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but , from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him ; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ” “ I believe her to be both in a great degree , ” replied Wickham ; “ I have not seen her for many years ; but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	woman	“ Mr. Collins , ” said she , “ speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but , from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him ; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ” “ I believe her to be both in a great degree , ” replied Wickham ; “ I have not seen her for many years ; but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	affability	She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	condescension	She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	woman	I _ should _ say , one of her Ladyship ’s carriages , for she has several . ” “ Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman , indeed , ” added Charlotte , “ and a most attentive neighbour . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	sort	She is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference . ” 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	woman	Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	glad	For your sake , ” turning to Charlotte , “ I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	glad	“ I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , ” said Lady Catherine ; “ and pray tell her from me , that she can not expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal . ” 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	sure	Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . ” 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	kindness	And if you will stay another _ month _ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche - box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and , indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . ” “ You are all kindness , madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . ” 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	attentive	I am excessively attentive to all those things . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	glad	I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _ you _ to let them go alone . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	glad	I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	sick	Their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news ; and various were the subjects which occupied them : Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria , across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ’s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her . “ Oh , Mary , ” said she , “ I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	friend	Wholly inattentive to her sister ’s feelings , Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy , calling for everyone ’s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . “ I can not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _ me _ as well as Lydia , ” said she , “ though I am _ not _ her particular friend . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	older	I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . ” 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	kind	you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . ” “ Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	slight	Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	delicate	Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	good	If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . ” CHAPTER XLIX . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	forwarder	“ We will be down as soon as we can , ” said Jane ; “ but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went upstairs half an hour ago . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	unknown	, though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	able	Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . “ Indeed , you are mistaken , madam ; I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . ” 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	woman	“ She is a very fine - looking woman ! 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	afraid	Very little was said by either ; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution ; and , perhaps , he might be doing the same . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	creature	Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed ; and while her courage was high , she immediately said,-- “ Mr. Darcy , I am a very selfish creature , and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	anxious	Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	indignant	Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	well	It will be in my power to assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight . ” 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	proficient	If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	confident	I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	relation	I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	choice	And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	ashamed	I am ashamed of you ! 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	daughter	He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ’s daughter ; so far we are equal . ” 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	daughter	You _ are _ a gentleman ’s daughter . 
Lydia Bennet	afraid	“ Oh , ” said Lydia , stoutly , “ I am not afraid ; for though I _ am _ the youngest , I ’m the tallest . 
Lydia Bennet	fortunate	Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . 
Lydia Bennet	girl	Lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . 
Lydia Bennet	favourite	Lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . 
Lydia Bennet	equal	She was very equal , therefore , to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . 
Lydia Bennet	silent	there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent . 
Lydia Bennet	tired	Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “ Lord , how tired I am ! ” accompanied by a violent yawn . When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation . 
Lydia Bennet	glad	She was met in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , “ I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! 
Lydia Bennet	glad	I am glad he is gone . 
Lydia Bennet	sure	“ I am sure there is not on _ his _ . 
Lydia Bennet	glad	“ I am glad I brought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another band - box ! 
Lydia Bennet	ashamed	how ashamed I should be of not being married before three - and - twenty ! 
Lydia Bennet	friends	Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by - the - bye , Mrs. Forster and me are _ such _ friends ! ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come : 
Lydia Bennet	ready	I was ready to die of laughter . 
Lydia Bennet	urgent	In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton , and see how everybody went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . 
Lydia Bennet	sure	“ I am sure I shall break _ mine _ , ” said Lydia . 
Lydia Bennet	easy	He heard her attentively , and then said,-- “ Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ” 
Lydia Bennet	flirt	Her character will be fixed ; and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . 
Lydia Bennet	poor	Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody . 
Lydia Bennet	young	But she is very young : she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . 
Lydia Bennet	ignorant	can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? ” 
Lydia Bennet	kind	I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . 
Lydia Bennet	serious	But at least it shows that _ she _ was serious in the object of her journey . Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _ scheme _ of infamy . 
Lydia Bennet	happy	“ She is happy , then , ” said her father , drily ; “ and her residence there will probably be of some duration . 
Lydia Bennet	bad	Poor Lydia ’s situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . 
Lydia Bennet	indebted	Had he done his duty in that respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her . 
Lydia Bennet	fond	“ She is so fond of Mrs. Forster , ” said she , “ it will be quite shocking to send her away ! 
Lydia Bennet	sure	when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! 
Lydia Bennet	afraid	I was afraid they might not ; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like anything . 
Lydia Bennet	determined	I was afraid they might not ; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like anything . 
Lydia Bennet	free	It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first . 
Lydia Bennet	sure	I am sure my sisters must all envy me . 
Lydia Bennet	fond	She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . Lydia was exceedingly fond of him . 
Lydia Bennet	sure	He did everything best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September than anybody else in the country . 
Lydia Bennet	sure	She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . 
Lydia Bennet	able	Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour . 
Lydia Bennet	confused	I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I _ should _ be looked at . 
Lydia Bennet	glad	I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . 
Lydia Bennet	afraid	Not that I am afraid of _ myself _ , but I dread other people ’s remarks . ” Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . 
Lydia Bennet	visitor	Lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long , that even Bingley ’s good - humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to _ talk _ of giving them a hint to be gone . 
Mr. Bennet	tiresome	“ My dear Mr. Bennet , ” replied his wife , “ how can you be so tiresome ? 
Mr. Bennet	handsome	You and the girls may go -- or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better ; for as you are as handsome as any of them 
Mr. Bennet	mixture	“ Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . ” Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three - and - twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . 
Mr. Bennet	glad	“ No more have I , ” said Mr. Bennet ; “ and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . ” 
Mr. Bennet	person	“ There is some sense in what he says about the girls , however ; and , if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . ” 
Mr. Bennet	glad	By tea - time , however , the dose had been enough , and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing - room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him [ Illustration : “ Protested that he never read novels ” H.T Feb 94 ] to read aloud to the ladies .

Mr. Bennet	likely	] excited before , how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James ’s . 
Mr. Bennet	dead	, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins , was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead . 
Mr. Bennet	fond	He was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments . 
Mr. Bennet	indebted	To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement . 
Mr. Bennet	cold	The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . ” They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr. Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . “ Do not give way to useless alarm , ” added he : “ though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 
Mr. Bennet	severe	“ You must not be too severe upon yourself , ” replied Elizabeth . 
Mr. Bennet	concerned	He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother - in - law ; and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . 
Mr. Bennet	loser	He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother ’s hands , Lydia ’s expenses had been very little within that sum . 
Mr. Bennet	quick	His letter was soon despatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution . 
Mr. Bennet	indebted	He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother ; but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her . 
Mr. Bennet	firm	A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr. Bennet was firm : it soon led to another ; and Mrs. Bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter . 
Mr. Bennet	proud	I am prodigiously proud of him . 
Mr. Bennet	happy	Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was . 
Mr. Bennet	man	Oh , he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! ” 
Caroline Bingley	unwilling	His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table ; nor was Mrs. Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . 
Caroline Bingley	astonishment	“ I am all astonishment . 
Caroline Bingley	sure	“ _ You _ observed it , Mr. Darcy , I am sure , ” said Miss Bingley ; “ and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _ your sister _ make such an exhibition . ” 
Caroline Bingley	inclined	“ _ You _ observed it , Mr. Darcy , I am sure , ” said Miss Bingley ; “ and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _ your sister _ make such an exhibition . ” 
Caroline Bingley	afraid	“ I am afraid , Mr. Darcy , ” observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , “ that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . ” 
Caroline Bingley	afraid	But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . 
Caroline Bingley	sure	She is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else . ” “ I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , ” cried Elizabeth ; “ I am _ not _ a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . ” “ In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , ” said Bingley ; “ and 
Caroline Bingley	sure	I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . 
Caroline Bingley	sure	“ Nor I , I am sure , ” said Miss Bingley . 
Caroline Bingley	satisfied	Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . 
Caroline Bingley	uncomfortable	Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters declared that they were miserable . 
Caroline Bingley	miserable	When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . ” 
Caroline Bingley	mistaken	I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . ” 
Caroline Bingley	incapable	Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything , and persevered , therefore , in requiring an explanation of his two motives . 
Caroline Bingley	sorry	Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay ; for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . 
Caroline Bingley	uncivil	She attracted him more than he liked ; and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _ her _ and more teasing than usual to himself . 
Caroline Bingley	sure	But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person , in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ” 
Caroline Bingley	aware	But may we not hope that the period of future happiness , to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? 
Caroline Bingley	relation	she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry _ her _ , had she been his relation . 
Caroline Bingley	incapable	Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . ” “ That is right . 
Charlotte Lucas	friend	Not that _ I _ think Charlotte so _ very _ plain ; but then she is our particular friend . 
Charlotte Lucas	plain	“ Oh dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . 
Charlotte Lucas	minute	Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . 
Charlotte Lucas	encouraging	He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that , if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise ; for , though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday . 
Charlotte Lucas	composed	Charlotte herself was tolerably composed . 
Charlotte Lucas	romantic	I am not romantic , you know . 
Charlotte Lucas	foolish	Mr. Bennet ’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !

Charlotte Lucas	mistress	“ Indeed , Mr. Bennet , ” said she , “ it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that _ I _ should be forced to make way for _ her _ , and live to see her take my place in it ! ” “ My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . 
Charlotte Lucas	likely	“ I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . 
Charlotte Lucas	sharp	If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . 
Charlotte Lucas	anxious	Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ’s letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over . 
Charlotte Lucas	kind	The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases ; and again , during the chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins . 
Charlotte Lucas	glad	Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . ” 
Mrs. Gardiner	sorry	I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . 
Mrs. Gardiner	afraid	Mrs. Gardiner ’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone : after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on:-- “ You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . 
Mrs. Gardiner	sure	Your father would depend on _ your _ resolution and good conduct , I am sure . 
Mrs. Gardiner	miserable	My father ’s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to forfeit it . 
Mrs. Gardiner	partial	My father , however , is partial to Mr. Wickham . 
Mrs. Gardiner	unwilling	I can not find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . 
Mrs. Gardiner	sorry	I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . ” 
Mrs. Gardiner	surprised	Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned : but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of anything else .

Sir William Lucas	determined	Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account ; for in general , you know , they visit no new comers . 
Sir William Lucas	delighted	Sir William had been delighted with him . 
Sir William Lucas	attention	For , though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to everybody . 
Sir William Lucas	severe	_ ] ] On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said,-- “ Did not you think , Mr. Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? ” “ With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . ” “ You are severe on us . ” “ It will be _ her _ turn soon to be teased , ” said Miss Lucas . 
Sir William Lucas	sure	“ You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . ” 
Sir William Lucas	annoyed	I was never more annoyed ! 
Sir William Lucas	sorry	“ I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . 
Sir William Lucas	cautious	You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its _ being created _ ? 
Sir William Lucas	surprised	Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation , moreover , including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ? ” “ I am the less surprised at what has happened , ” replied Sir William , “ from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . 
Georgiana Darcy	tall	“ Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? ” said Miss Bingley : “ will she be as tall as I am ? ” “ I think she will . 
Georgiana Darcy	height	She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ’s height , or rather taller . ” 
Georgiana Darcy	taller	She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ’s height , or rather taller . ” 
Georgiana Darcy	delighted	The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each . “ How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! ” He made no answer . 
Georgiana Darcy	sort	“ What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? 
Georgiana Darcy	much	It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy ; but she is too much like her brother,--very , very proud . 
Georgiana Darcy	affectionate	As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . 
Georgiana Darcy	pleasing	As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . 
Georgiana Darcy	girl	She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , I understand , highly accomplished . Since her father ’s death her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . ” 
Georgiana Darcy	kind	“ Oh yes , ” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . ” 
Georgiana Darcy	old	Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . 
Georgiana Darcy	handsome	“ And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? ” said Mr. Gardiner . 
Georgiana Darcy	proud	Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy . 
Georgiana Darcy	shy	Since her being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy . 
Georgiana Darcy	tall	Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful . 
Georgiana Darcy	handsome	She was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good - humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . 
Georgiana Darcy	welcome	I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson ’s room . 
Georgiana Darcy	eager	Bingley was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner . 
Georgiana Darcy	proud	Georgiana ’s reception of them was very civil , but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved . Mrs. Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 
Georgiana Darcy	reserved	Georgiana ’s reception of them was very civil , but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved . Mrs. Gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . 
Mr. Gardiner	man	Mr. Gardiner was a sensible , gentlemanlike man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . 
Mr. Gardiner	kind	The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . ” They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr. Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . “ Do not give way to useless alarm , ” added he : “ though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . 
Mr. Gardiner	surprised	Your uncle is as much surprised as I am ; and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done . 
Mr. Gardiner	able	He had been some days in town before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . 
Mr. Gardiner	amazement	Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . 
Mr. Gardiner	able	As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . 
Mr. Gardiner	afraid	But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . 
Mary Bennet	lady	For you are a young lady of deep reflection , I know , and read great books , and make extracts . 
Mary Bennet	glad	Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the Lucases , and two or three officers , joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began:-- “ What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr. Darcy ! 
Mary Bennet	disconcerted	Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and Elizabeth , sorry for her , and sorry for her father ’s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . 
Mary Bennet	safe	“ And Mary King is safe ! ” added Elizabeth ; “ safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . ” 
Mary Bennet	safe	“ And Mary King is safe ! ” added Elizabeth ; “ safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . ” 
Mary Bennet	fool	“ She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . ” 
Mary Bennet	kind	you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . ” “ Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . 
Mary Bennet	daughter	Mary was the only daughter who remained at home ; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet ’s being quite unable to sit alone . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	different	Colonel Fitzwilliam ’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love her friend Eliza , she set herself seriously to work to find it out : she watched him whenever they were at Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	man	He was , beyond comparison , the pleasantest man : he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . 
Colonel Fitzwilliam	frightened	“ You need not be frightened . 
Mrs. Phillips	glad	Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces ; and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome ; and she was eagerly 
Mrs. Phillips	vulgar	Mrs. Philips ’s vulgarity was another , and , perhaps , a greater tax on his forbearance ; and though Mrs. Philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley ’s good - humour encouraged ; yet , whenever she _ did _ speak , she must be vulgar . 
Mrs. Phillips	nervous	I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well - informed woman for the rest of her life ; though , perhaps , it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly .

Mr. Hurst	man	Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr. Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who , when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her . 
Mr. Hurst	fellow	“ And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow ; and though I have not many , I have more than I ever looked into . ” 
Mrs. Hurst	disposed	His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but though he was now established only as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table ; nor was Mrs. Hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . 
Mrs. Hurst	certain	“ Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain , and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office . ” 
Anne de Bourgh	superior	Lady Catherine herself says that , in point of true beauty , Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . 
Anne de Bourgh	rude	“ She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind . 
Anne de Bourgh	pale	Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly : her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs. Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes . 
Anne de Bourgh	sickly	Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly : her features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to Mrs. Jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes . 
Anne de Bourgh	hot	Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh ’s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . 
Anne de Bourgh	cold	Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh ’s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light . 
Lady Lucas	determined	Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account ; for in general , you know , they visit no new comers . 
Lady Lucas	kind	Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet . 
Lady Lucas	insensible	Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs. Bennet ’s sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . 
Lady Lucas	happy	Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs. Bennet ’s sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away . 
Lady Lucas	kind	She was of great use and comfort to us all , and Lady Lucas has been very kind : she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . ” “ She had better have stayed at home , ” cried Elizabeth : “ perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one ’s neighbours .
