Character	Modifier	Context
Fanny Price	old	Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old , and though there might not be much in her first appearance to captivate , there was , at least , nothing to disgust her relations . 
Fanny Price	small	She was small of her age , with no glow of complexion , nor any other striking beauty ; exceedingly timid and shy , and shrinking from notice ; but her air , though awkward , was not vulgar , her voice was sweet , and when she spoke her countenance was pretty . 
Fanny Price	happy	Mrs. Norris had been talking to her the whole way from Northampton of her wonderful good fortune , and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and good behaviour which it ought to produce , and her consciousness of misery was therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing for her not to be happy . 
Fanny Price	girl	In vain were the well - meant condescensions of Sir Thomas , and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that she would be a good girl ; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug , and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart towards giving her comfort ; she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her , and sleep seeming to be her likeliest friend , she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed 
Fanny Price	sorry	I do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her , for , with all its faults , it _ was _ her home , and she can not as yet understand how much she has changed for the better ; but then there is moderation in all things . 
Fanny Price	forlorn	Fanny , whether near or from her cousins , whether in the schoolroom , the drawing - room , or the shrubbery , was equally forlorn , finding something to fear in every person and place . 
Fanny Price	important	Her elder cousins mortified her by reflections on her size , and abashed her by noticing her shyness : Miss Lee wondered at her ignorance , and the maid - servants sneered at her clothes ; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers and sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow , instructress , and nurse , the despondence that sunk her little heart was severe . 
Fanny Price	ill	Was she ill ? 
Fanny Price	puzzled	or was she puzzled about anything in her lesson that he could explain ? 
Fanny Price	sorry	“ You are sorry to leave Mama , my dear little Fanny , ” said he , “ which shows you to be a very good girl ; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends , who all love you , and wish to make you happy . 
Fanny Price	girl	“ You are sorry to leave Mama , my dear little Fanny , ” said he , “ which shows you to be a very good girl ; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends , who all love you , and wish to make you happy . 
Fanny Price	afraid	The little rusticities and awkwardnesses which had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all , and not least of herself , necessarily wore away , and she was no longer materially afraid to appear before her uncle , nor did her aunt Norris ’s voice make her start very much . 
Fanny Price	accomplished	But , all things considered , I do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so , for , though you know ( owing to me ) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you , it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are;—on the contrary , it is much more desirable that there should be a difference . 
Fanny Price	dull	As for Fanny ’s being stupid at learning , “ she could only say it was very unlucky , but some people _ were _ stupid , and Fanny must take more pains : she did not know what else was to be done ; and , except her being so dull , she must add she saw no harm in the poor little thing , and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages , and fetching what she wanted . ” 
Fanny Price	present	In the fullness of his belief that such a thing must be , he mentioned its probability to his wife ; and the first time of the subject ’s occurring to her again happening to be when Fanny was present , she calmly observed to her , “ So , Fanny , you are going to leave us , and live with my sister . 
Fanny Price	surprised	Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt ’s words , “ Going to leave you ? ” 
Fanny Price	years	You have been five years with us , and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died . 
Fanny Price	sorry	“ I shall be very sorry to go away , ” said she , with a faltering voice . 
Fanny Price	ungrateful	“ I hope I am not ungrateful , aunt , ” said Fanny modestly . 
Fanny Price	sure	“ Never , my dear ; but you are sure of a comfortable home . 
Fanny Price	glad	She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought , and I am glad her love of money does not interfere . 
Fanny Price	companion	But you are now of an age to be treated better ; I think she is behaving better already ; and when you are her only companion , you _ must _ be important to her . 
Fanny Price	important	“ I can never be important to any one . ” “ What is to prevent you ? 
Fanny Price	important	There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known . 
Fanny Price	sure	You have good sense , and a sweet temper , and I am sure you have a grateful heart , that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it . 
Fanny Price	kind	“ You are too kind , ” said Fanny , colouring at such praise ; “ how shall I ever thank you as I ought , for thinking so well of me . 
Fanny Price	right	Fanny sighed , and said , “ I can not see things as you do ; but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself , 
Fanny Price	convinced	“ And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health , and as much for your ultimate happiness too . 
Fanny Price	encumbrance	She is no encumbrance here . ” 
Fanny Price	able	But he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification , by adding , “ If William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . ” 
Fanny Price	sure	I am sure William would never have used _ me _ so , under any circumstances . 
Fanny Price	absent	And what right had she to suppose that _ you _ would not write long letters when you were absent ? ” “ The right of a lively mind , Fanny , seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others ; perfectly allowable , when untinctured by ill - humour or roughness ; and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford : nothing sharp , or loud , or coarse . 
Fanny Price	ready	returned with it in excellent time , before either Fanny or the steady old coachman , who always attended her when she rode without her cousins , were ready to set forward . 
Fanny Price	strong	; “ I am very strong . 
Fanny Price	strong	You know I am strong enough now to walk very well . ” 
Fanny Price	sullen	As Mr. Rushworth did _ not _ come , the injury was increased , and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him ; she could only be sullen to her mother , aunt , and cousin , and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert . 
Fanny Price	little	You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa . ” Before half this was said , Fanny was returned to her seat at the table , and had taken up her work again ; and Julia , who was in high good - humour , from the pleasures of the day , did her the justice of exclaiming , “ I must say , ma’am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . ” “ Fanny , ” said Edmund , after looking at her attentively , “ I am sure you have the headache . ” She could not deny it , but said it was not very bad . “ I can hardly believe you , ” he replied ; “ I know your looks too well . 
Fanny Price	regular	” “ I wish Fanny had half your strength , ma’am . ” “ If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise , she would not be knocked up so soon . 
Fanny Price	interesting	Of pictures there were abundance , and some few good , but the larger part were family portraits , no longer anything to anybody but Mrs. Rushworth , who had been at great pains to learn all that the housekeeper could teach , and was now almost equally well qualified to shew the house . On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to Miss Crawford and Fanny , but there was no comparison in the willingness of their attention ; for Miss Crawford , who had seen scores of great houses , and cared for none of them , had only the appearance of civilly listening , while Fanny , to whom everything was almost as interesting as it was new , attended with unaffected earnestness to all that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in former times , its rise and grandeur , regal visits and loyal efforts , delighted to connect anything with history already known , or warm her imagination with scenes of the past . 
Fanny Price	tired	Fanny made the first interruption by saying , “ I wonder that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood ; but the next time we come to a seat , if it is not disagreeable to you , I should be glad to sit down for a little while . ” 
Fanny Price	glad	Fanny made the first interruption by saying , “ I wonder that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood ; but the next time we come to a seat , if it is not disagreeable to you , I should be glad to sit down for a little while . ” 
Fanny Price	thoughtless	“ My dear Fanny , ” cried Edmund , immediately drawing her arm within his , “ how thoughtless I have been ! 
Fanny Price	tired	“ Thank you , but I am not at all tired . ” 
Fanny Price	fly	At Oxford I have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street , and you are only a fly in the comparison . ” 
Fanny Price	tired	“ I am really not tired , which I almost wonder at ; for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood . 
Fanny Price	sure	I know nothing of your furlongs , but I am sure it is a very long wood , and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it ; and therefore , when I say that we have walked a mile in it , I must speak within compass . 
Fanny Price	stronger	Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an earnestness which she could not resist , and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin ’s care , but with great regret that she was not stronger . 
Fanny Price	alive	Her cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken , and , smiling with all the good - humour of success , she said , “ Thank you , my dear Fanny , but I and my gown are alive and well , and so good - bye . ” 
Fanny Price	well	Her cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken , and , smiling with all the good - humour of success , she said , “ Thank you , my dear Fanny , but I and my gown are alive and well , and so good - bye . ” 
Fanny Price	sorry	Fanny was again left to her solitude , and with no increase of pleasant feelings , for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard , astonished at Miss Bertram , and angry with Mr. Crawford . 
Fanny Price	astonished	Fanny was again left to her solitude , and with no increase of pleasant feelings , for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard , astonished at Miss Bertram , and angry with Mr. Crawford . 
Fanny Price	sorry	I have had walking enough . ” And he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny . “ I am very sorry , ” said she ; “ it is very unlucky . ” 
Fanny Price	tired	Fanny ’s best consolation was in being assured that Edmund had wished for her very much , and that he should certainly have come back for her , had she not been tired already ; but this was not quite sufficient to do away with the pain of having been left a whole hour , when he had talked of only a few minutes , nor to banish the sort of curiosity she felt to know what they had been conversing about all that time ; and the result of the whole was to her disappointment and depression , as they prepared by general agreement to return to the house . 
Fanny Price	sure	“ But _ that _ I am sure it has not , ” cried Fanny . 
Fanny Price	sure	Fanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike ; but since the day at Sotherton , she could never see Mr. Crawford with either sister without observation , and seldom without wonder or censure ; and had her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise of it in every other respect , had she been sure that she was seeing clearly , and judging candidly , she would probably have made some important communications to her usual confidant . 
Fanny Price	privy	She was privy , one evening , to the hopes of her aunt Norris on the subject , as well as to her feelings , and the feelings of Mrs. Rushworth , on a point of some similarity , and could not help wondering as she listened ; and glad would she have been not to be obliged to listen , for it was while all the other young people were dancing , and she sitting , most unwillingly , among the chaperons at the fire , longing for the re - entrance of her elder cousin , on whom all her own hopes of a partner then depended .

Fanny Price	unreasonable	Fanny found that it was not to be , and in the modesty of her nature immediately felt that she had been unreasonable in expecting it . 
Fanny Price	happy	_ I _ do not wish to make objections ; I shall be happy to be of any use , but I think we could not chuse worse . 
Fanny Price	wife	You must be Cottager ’s wife . 
Fanny Price	mouse	It need not frighten you : it is a nothing of a part , a mere nothing , not above half a dozen speeches altogether , and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say ; so you may be as creep - mouse as you like , but we must have you to look at . ” “ If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches , ” cried Mr. Rushworth , “ what would you do with such a part as mine ? 
Fanny Price	afraid	It need not frighten you : it is a nothing of a part , a mere nothing , not above half a dozen speeches altogether , and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say ; so you may be as creep - mouse as you like , but we must have you to look at . ” “ If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches , ” cried Mr. Rushworth , “ what would you do with such a part as mine ? 
Fanny Price	afraid	“ It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart , ” said Fanny , shocked to find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room , and to feel that almost every eye was upon her ; “ but I really can not act . ” 
Fanny Price	woman	You must get a brown gown , and a white apron , and a mob cap , and we must make you a few wrinkles , and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes , and you will be a very proper , little old woman . 
Fanny Price	alone	To be called into notice in such a manner , to hear that it was but the prelude to something so infinitely worse , to be told that she must do what was so impossible as to act ; and then to have the charge of obstinacy and ingratitude follow it , enforced with such a hint at the dependence of her situation , had been too distressing at the time to make the remembrance when she was alone much less so , especially with the superadded dread of what the morrow might produce in continuation of the subject . 
Fanny Price	mistress	The little white attic , which had continued her sleeping - room ever since her first entering the family , proving incompetent to suggest any reply , she had recourse , as soon as she was dressed , to another apartment more spacious and more meet for walking about in and thinking , and of which she had now for some time been almost equally mistress . 
Fanny Price	glad	The room had then become useless , and for some time was quite deserted , except by Fanny , when she visited her plants , or wanted one of the books , which she was still glad to keep there , from the deficiency of space and accommodation in her little chamber above : but gradually , as her value for the comforts of it increased , she had added to her possessions , and spent more of her time there ; and having nothing to oppose her , had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it , that it was now generally admitted to be hers . 
Fanny Price	right	Was she _ right _ in refusing what was so warmly asked , so strongly wished for — what might be so essential to a scheme on which some of those to whom she owed the greatest complaisance had set their hearts ? Was it not ill - nature , selfishness , and a fear of exposing herself ? 
Fanny Price	aware	I am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom . ” Fanny could not answer him . 
Fanny Price	sorry	“ I am sorry for Miss Crawford ; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against , and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle . 
Fanny Price	sorry	“ I am sorry for Miss Crawford ; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against , and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle . 
Fanny Price	disposed	“ Perhaps , ” said Tom , “ Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now . 
Fanny Price	determined	Perhaps you may persuade _ her _ . ” “ No , she is quite determined . 
Fanny Price	safe	She was safe ; but peace and safety were unconnected here . 
Fanny Price	full	She was full of jealousy and agitation . 
Fanny Price	sad	She alone was sad and insignificant : she had no share in anything ; she might go or stay ; she might be in the midst of their noise , or retreat from it to the solitude of the East room , without being seen or missed . 
Fanny Price	best	_ You _ are best off , I can tell you : but if nobody did more than _ you _ , we should not get on very fast . ” Fanny took the work very quietly , without attempting any defence ; but her kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf — “ One can not wonder , sister , that Fanny _ should _ be delighted : it is all new to her , you know ; you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves , and so am I still ; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure , _ I _ mean to look in at their rehearsals too . 
Fanny Price	warm	“ Thank you ; I am quite warm , very warm . 
Fanny Price	civil	” Fanny was most civil in her assurances , though she could not give them in a very steady voice . “ Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean ? ” continued Miss Crawford , opening her book . 
Fanny Price	glad	on Sir Thomas ’s affection was much too humble to give her any idea of classing herself with his children , she was glad to remain behind and gain a little breathing - time . 
Fanny Price	oppressed	She was quite oppressed . 
Fanny Price	miserable	He inquired next after her family , especially William : and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little , and thinking his return a misfortune ; and when , on having courage to lift her eyes to his face , she saw that he was grown thinner , and had the burnt , fagged , worn look of fatigue and a hot climate , every tender feeling was increased , and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him . 
Fanny Price	right	“ I believe you are right , Fanny , ” was his reply , after a short consideration . 
Fanny Price	graver	I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before . ” “ I suppose I am graver than other people , ” said Fanny . 
Fanny Price	sure	I am sure I do . 
Fanny Price	alive	She was all alive again directly , and among the most active in being useful to Fanny , in detecting her to be wetter than she would at first allow , and providing her with dry clothes ; and Fanny , after being obliged to submit to all this attention , and to being assisted and waited on by mistresses and maids , being also obliged , on returning downstairs , to be fixed in their drawing - room for an hour while the rain continued , the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was thus extended to Miss Crawford , and might carry on her spirits to the period of dressing and dinner . 
Fanny Price	wetter	She was all alive again directly , and among the most active in being useful to Fanny , in detecting her to be wetter than she would at first allow , and providing her with dry clothes ; and Fanny , after being obliged to submit to all this attention , and to being assisted and waited on by mistresses and maids , being also obliged , on returning downstairs , to be fixed in their drawing - room for an hour while the rain continued , the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was thus extended to Miss Crawford , and might carry on her spirits to the period of dressing and dinner . 
Fanny Price	aware	The two sisters were so kind to her , and so pleasant , that Fanny might have enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way , and could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at the end of the hour , and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant ’s carriage and horses out to take her home , with which she was threatened . As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather might occasion at home , she had nothing to suffer on that score ; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts , she was perfectly aware that none would be felt , and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain , her being in such cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram . 
Fanny Price	glad	“ I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive ! ” said Fanny , in reply . 
Fanny Price	apt	You will think me rhapsodising ; but when I am out of doors , especially when I am sitting out of doors , I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain . 
Fanny Price	silent	Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing ; for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth ’s wife must be to fill her house , and give the best balls in the country . ” Fanny was silent , and Miss Crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness , till suddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes , she exclaimed , “ Ah ! here he is . ” 
Fanny Price	absent	A look of consciousness as he spoke , and what seemed a consciousness of manner on Miss Crawford ’s side as she made some laughing answer , was sorrowfull food for Fanny ’s observation ; and finding herself quite unable to attend as she ought to Mrs. Grant , by whose side she was now following the others , she had nearly resolved on going home immediately , and only waited for courage to say so , when the sound of the great clock at Mansfield Park , striking three , made her feel that she had really been much longer absent than usual , and brought the previous self - inquiry of whether she should take leave or not just then , and how , to a very speedy issue . 
Fanny Price	surprise	This was so new an attention , so perfectly new a circumstance in the events of Fanny ’s life , that she was all surprise and embarrassment ; and while stammering out her great obligation , and her “ but she did not suppose it would be in her power , ” was looking at Edmund for his opinion and help . 
Fanny Price	anxious	She was anxious , she knew — more anxious perhaps than she ought to be — for what was it after all whether she went or staid ? 
Fanny Price	anxious	She was anxious , she knew — more anxious perhaps than she ought to be — for what was it after all whether she went or staid ? 
Fanny Price	able	but if her uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding , and with very grave looks , and those grave looks directed to her , and at last decide against her , she might not be able to appear properly submissive and indifferent . 
Fanny Price	late	“ She will be late , ” said Sir Thomas , taking out his watch ; “ but what is your difficulty ? ” 
Fanny Price	right	Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer . 
Fanny Price	glad	“ Thank you , I am _ so _ glad , ” was Fanny ’s instinctive reply ; though when she had turned from him and shut the door , she could not help feeling , “ And yet why should I be glad ? 
Fanny Price	glad	“ Thank you , I am _ so _ glad , ” was Fanny ’s instinctive reply ; though when she had turned from him and shut the door , she could not help feeling , “ And yet why should I be glad ? 
Fanny Price	certain	for am I not certain of seeing or hearing something there to pain me ? ” 
Fanny Price	glad	In spite of this conviction , however , she was glad . 
Fanny Price	aware	You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking of you , and to your aunt for letting you go , and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary ; for I hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way , or ever dining out at all ; and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated . 
Fanny Price	certain	Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to _ us _ to take a little notice of you , or else it would never have come into her head , and you may be very certain that , if your cousin Julia had been at home , you would not have been asked at all . 
Fanny Price	easy	_ I _ shall be here , so you may be quite easy about your aunt . 
Fanny Price	lowest	Remember , wherever you are , you must be the lowest and last ; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage 
Fanny Price	alone	She felt that the carriage was for herself , and herself alone : and her uncle ’s consideration of her , coming immediately after such representations from her aunt , cost her some tears of gratitude when she was alone . 
Fanny Price	aware	She was soon aware of this herself ; for though she must submit , as her own propriety of mind directed , in spite of her aunt Norris ’s opinion , to being the principal lady in company , and to all the little distinctions consequent thereon , she found , 
Fanny Price	friend	And then changing his tone again to one of gentle gallantry , and addressing Fanny , he said , “ You were Mr. Rushworth ’s best friend . 
Fanny Price	right	He was surprised ; but after a few moments ’ silent consideration of her , replied in a calmer , graver tone , and as if the candid result of conviction , “ I believe you are right . 
Fanny Price	glad	I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off . 
Fanny Price	different	You see her every day , and therefore do not notice it ; but I assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn . 
Fanny Price	pretty	She was then merely a quiet , modest , not plain - looking girl , but she is now absolutely pretty . 
Fanny Price	girl	The truth is , that she was the only girl in company for you to notice , and you must have a somebody . 
Fanny Price	solemn	Is she solemn ? 
Fanny Price	queer	Is she queer ? 
Fanny Price	prudish	Is she prudish ? 
Fanny Price	creature	I do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy ; a _ little _ love , perhaps , may animate and do her good , but I will not have you plunge her deep , for she is as good a little creature as ever lived , and has a great deal of feeling . ” 
Fanny Price	happy	I only want her to look kindly on me , to give me smiles as well as blushes , to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are , and be all animation when I take it and talk to her ; to think as I think , be interested in all my possessions and pleasures , try to keep me longer at Mansfield , and feel when I go away that she shall be never happy again . 
Fanny Price	lieutenant	only think , William , when you are a lieutenant , how little you will care for any nonsense of this kind . ” 
Fanny Price	dancer	And turning to his uncle , who was now close to them , “ Is not Fanny a very good dancer , sir ? ” 
Fanny Price	present	True enough , he had once seen Fanny dance ; and it was equally true that he would now have answered for her gliding about with quiet , light elegance , and in admirable time ; but , in fact , he could not for the life of him recall what her dancing had been , and rather took it for granted that she had been present than remembered anything about her . 
Fanny Price	insensible	It was impossible for her to be insensible of Mr. Crawford ’s change of manners . 
Fanny Price	kind	I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste ; but , at any rate , I know you will be kind to my intentions , and consider it , as it really is , a token of the love of one of your oldest friends . 
Fanny Price	able	Having regulated her thoughts and comforted her feelings by this happy mixture of reason and weakness , she was able in due time to go down and resume her usual employments near her aunt Bertram , and pay her the usual observances without any apparent want of spirits . 
Fanny Price	happy	The proposal was a very pleasant one to William himself , who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses , and such a good - humoured , agreeable friend ; and , in likening it to going up with despatches , was saying at once everything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination could suggest ; and Fanny , from a different motive , was exceedingly pleased ; for the original plan was that William should go up by the mail from Northampton the following night , which would not have allowed him an hour ’s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach ; and though this offer of Mr. Crawford ’s would rob her of many hours of his company , she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of such a journey , to think of anything else . 
Fanny Price	sorry	Fanny struggled for speech , and said , “ I am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you . 
Fanny Price	vexed	I am only vexed for a moment . 
Fanny Price	listener	You are a kind , kind listener . 
Fanny Price	useful	Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment , and therefore , after a moment ’s consideration , said , “ If you only want me as a listener , cousin , I will be as useful as I can ; but I am not qualified for an adviser . 
Fanny Price	qualified	Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment , and therefore , after a moment ’s consideration , said , “ If you only want me as a listener , cousin , I will be as useful as I can ; but I am not qualified for an adviser . 
Fanny Price	competent	I am not competent . ” 
Fanny Price	sorry	Do not tell me anything now , which hereafter you may be sorry for . 
Fanny Price	thought	“ Dearest Fanny ! ” cried Edmund , pressing her hand to his lips with almost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford ’s , “ you are all considerate thought ! 
Fanny Price	being	You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said ; but you have always known my opinion of her ; you can bear me witness , Fanny , that I have never been blinded . 
Fanny Price	afraid	I can not be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say . 
Fanny Price	glad	It had really occurred to her , unprompted , that Fanny , preparing for a ball , might be glad of better help than the upper housemaid ’s , and when dressed herself , she actually sent her own maid to assist her ; too late , of course , to be of any use . 
Fanny Price	object	To the former she was an interesting object , and he saw with pleasure the general elegance of her appearance , and her being in remarkably good looks . 
Fanny Price	happy	From a variety of causes she was happy , and she was soon made still happier ; for 
Fanny Price	such	To be urging her opinion against Sir Thomas ’s was a proof of the extremity of the case ; but such was her horror at the first suggestion , that she could actually look him in the face and say that she hoped it might be settled otherwise 
Fanny Price	horror	To be urging her opinion against Sir Thomas ’s was a proof of the extremity of the case ; but such was her horror at the first suggestion , that she could actually look him in the face and say that she hoped it might be settled otherwise 
Fanny Price	frightened	It was rather honour than happiness to Fanny , for the first dance at least : her partner was in excellent spirits , and tried to impart them to her ; but she was a great deal too much frightened to have any enjoyment till she could suppose herself no longer looked at . 
Fanny Price	attractive	She was attractive , she was modest , she was Sir Thomas ’s niece , and she was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford . 
Fanny Price	modest	She was attractive , she was modest , she was Sir Thomas ’s niece , and she was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford . 
Fanny Price	object	But it was not to be avoided : he made her feel that she was the object of all ; though she could not say that it was unpleasantly done , that there was indelicacy or ostentation in his manner ; and sometimes , when he talked of William , he was really not unagreeable , and shewed even a warmth of heart which did him credit . 
Fanny Price	happy	She was happy whenever she looked at William , and saw how perfectly he was enjoying himself , in every five minutes that she could walk about with him and hear his account of his partners ; she was happy in knowing herself admired ; and she was happy in having the two dances with Edmund still to look forward to , during the greatest part of the evening , her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite engagement with _ him _ was in continual perspective .

Fanny Price	happy	She was happy even when they did take place ; but not from any flow of spirits on his side , or any such expressions of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning . His mind was fagged , and her happiness sprung from being the friend with whom it could find repose . 
Fanny Price	urgent	Fanny was too urgent , however , and had too many tears in her eyes for denial ; and it ended in a gracious “ Well , well ! ” which was permission . 
Fanny Price	thankful	she was thankful that she could now sit in the same room with her uncle , hear his voice , receive his questions , and even answer them , without such wretched feelings as she had formerly known . “ We miss our two young men , ” was Sir Thomas ’s observation on both the first and second day , as they formed their very reduced circle after dinner ; and in consideration of Fanny ’s swimming eyes , nothing more was said on the first day than to drink their good health ; but on the second it led to something farther . 
Fanny Price	companion	Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding , “ Very true . We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face , she is now a very valuable companion . 
Fanny Price	necessary	If we have been kind to _ her _ , she is now quite as necessary to _ us _ . ” 
Fanny Price	better	Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her . 
Fanny Price	sure	Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for ? ” “ I only heard a part of the letter ; it was to my uncle ; but I believe it was very short ; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines . 
Fanny Price	sure	; I am not quite sure which . ” “ Oh ! 
Fanny Price	woman	She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the Admiral , for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world . 
Fanny Price	woman	She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the Admiral , for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world . 
Fanny Price	impossibility	She is the very impossibility he would describe , if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas . 
Fanny Price	well	Henry Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of good principles in a wife , though he was too little accustomed to serious reflection to know them by their proper name ; but when he talked of her having such a steadiness and regularity of conduct , such a high notion of honour , and such an observance of decorum as might warrant any man in the fullest dependence on her faith and integrity , he expressed what was inspired by the knowledge of her being well principled and religious . “ I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her , ” said he ; “ and _ that _ is what I want . ” 
Fanny Price	sister	Fanny will be so truly your sister ! ” 
Fanny Price	bewildered	I beg your pardon , but I am bewildered . 
Fanny Price	able	, he could not have borne any participation of his feelings , but this had been his business ; and he spoke with such a glow of what his solicitude had been , and used such strong expressions , was so abounding in the _ deepest _ _ interest _ , in _ twofold _ _ motives _ , in _ views _ _ and _ _ wishes _ _ more _ _ than _ _ could _ _ be _ _ told _ , that Fanny could not have remained insensible of his drift , had she been able to attend ; but her heart was so full and her senses still so astonished , that she could listen but imperfectly even to what he told her of William , and saying only when he paused , “ How kind ! how very kind ! 
Fanny Price	distressed	When she did understand it , however , and found herself expected to believe that she had created sensations which his heart had never known before , and that everything he had done for William was to be placed to the account of his excessive and unequalled attachment to her , she was exceedingly distressed , and for some moments unable to speak . 
Fanny Price	resentful	While her heart was still bounding with joy and gratitude on William ’s behalf , she could not be severely resentful of anything that injured only herself ; and after having twice drawn back her hand , and twice attempted in vain to turn away from him , she got up , and said only , with much agitation , “ Do n’t , Mr. Crawford , pray do n’t ! 
Fanny Price	eager	She would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the great staircase , till she had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford ’s having left the house ; but when convinced of his being gone , she was eager to go down and be with her uncle , and have all the happiness of his joy as well as her own , and all the benefit of his information or his conjectures as to what would now be William ’s destination . 
Fanny Price	distressed	She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her , and he spoke to her much too often ; and she was afraid there was a something in his voice and manner in addressing her very different from what they were when he talked to the others . 
Fanny Price	afraid	She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her , and he spoke to her much too often ; and she was afraid there was a something in his voice and manner in addressing her very different from what they were when he talked to the others . 
Fanny Price	ready	, she was ready to sink with shame , from the dread of Mr. Crawford ’s interpretation ; for though nothing could have tempted her to turn her eyes to the right hand , where he sat , she felt that _ his _ were immediately directed towards her . 
Fanny Price	silent	She was more silent than ever . 
Fanny Price	able	She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever , and began to be in despair of ever getting away ; but at last they were in the drawing - room , and she was able to think as she would , while her aunts finished the subject of William ’s appointment in their own style . 
Fanny Price	glad	She was very glad that she had given William what she did at parting , very glad , indeed , that it had been in her power , without material inconvenience , just at that time to give him something rather considerable ; that is , for _ her _ , with _ her _ limited means , for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin .

Fanny Price	ashamed	Fanny was ashamed of her own doubts . 
Fanny Price	unequal	The rest of your note I know means nothing ; but I am so unequal to anything of the sort , that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice . 
Fanny Price	attention	She was all attention , however , in placing a chair for him , and trying to appear honoured ; and , in her agitation , had quite overlooked the deficiencies of her apartment , till he , stopping short as he entered , said , with much surprise , “ Why have you no fire to - day ? ” 
Fanny Price	cold	“ I am not cold , sir : I never sit here long at this time of year . ” 
Fanny Price	strong	You are not strong . 
Fanny Price	chilly	You are chilly . 
Fanny Price	silent	Fanny would rather have been silent ; but being obliged to speak , she could not forbear , in justice to the aunt she loved best , from saying something in which the words “ my aunt Norris ” were distinguishable . 
Fanny Price	aware	“ You are not aware , perhaps , that I have had a visitor this morning . 
Fanny Price	sure	On the contrary , I told him , I can not recollect my exact words , but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him , that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect , and that I begged him never to talk to me in that manner again . 
Fanny Price	sure	I am sure I said as much as that and more ; and I should have said still more , if I had been quite certain of his meaning anything seriously ; but I did not like to be , I could not bear to be , imputing more than might be intended . 
Fanny Price	wilful	But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse ; that you can and will decide for yourself , without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you , without even asking their advice . 
Fanny Price	perverse	But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse ; that you can and will decide for yourself , without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you , without even asking their advice . 
Fanny Price	sorry	“ I am very sorry , ” said she inarticulately , through her tears , “ I am very sorry indeed . ” 
Fanny Price	sorry	“ I am very sorry , ” said she inarticulately , through her tears , “ I am very sorry indeed . ” 
Fanny Price	convinced	“ If it were possible for me to do otherwise ” said she , with another strong effort ; “ but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him happy , and that I should be miserable myself . ” Another burst of tears ; but in spite of that burst , and in spite of that great black word _ miserable _ , which served to introduce it , Sir Thomas began to think a little relenting , a little change of inclination , might have something to do with it ; and to augur favourably from the personal entreaty of the young man himself . 
Fanny Price	miserable	“ If it were possible for me to do otherwise ” said she , with another strong effort ; “ but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him happy , and that I should be miserable myself . ” Another burst of tears ; but in spite of that burst , and in spite of that great black word _ miserable _ , which served to introduce it , Sir Thomas began to think a little relenting , a little change of inclination , might have something to do with it ; and to augur favourably from the personal entreaty of the young man himself . 
Fanny Price	timid	He knew her to be very timid , and exceedingly nervous ; and thought it not improbable that her mind might be in such a state as a little time , a little pressing , a little patience , and a little impatience , a judicious mixture of all on the lover ’s side , might work their usual effect on .

Fanny Price	brute	“ I must be a brute , indeed , if I can be really ungrateful ! ” said she , in soliloquy . 
Fanny Price	ungrateful	“ I must be a brute , indeed , if I can be really ungrateful ! ” said she , in soliloquy . 
Fanny Price	sure	Her uncle ’s behaviour to her was then as nearly as possible what it had been before ; she was sure he did not mean there should be any change , and that it was only her own conscience that could fancy any ; but her aunt was soon quarrelling with her ; and 
Fanny Price	willing	It was over , however , at last ; and the evening set in with more composure to Fanny , and more cheerfulness of spirits than she could have hoped for after so stormy a morning ; but she trusted , in the first place , that she had done right : that her judgment had not misled her . For the purity of her intentions she could answer ; and she was willing to hope , secondly , that her uncle ’s displeasure was abating , and would abate farther as he considered the matter with more impartiality , and felt , as a good man must feel , how wretched , and how unpardonable , how hopeless , and how wicked it was to marry without affection . When the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past , she could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally concluded , and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield , that everything would soon be as if no such subject had existed . 
Fanny Price	eager	Depend upon it , it is not you who are wanted ; depend upon it , it is me ” ( looking at the butler ) ; “ but you are so very eager to put yourself forward . 
Fanny Price	aware	manner was incurably gentle ; and she was not aware how much it concealed the sternness of her purpose . 
Fanny Price	compassionate	She must be courteous , and she must be compassionate . 
Fanny Price	angry	Now she was angry . 
Fanny Price	able	So thought Fanny , in good truth and sober sadness , as she sat musing over that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs : wondering at the past and present ; wondering at what was yet to come , and in a nervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of her being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford , and the felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it . 
Fanny Price	sorry	“ Indeed , sir , ” said Fanny , “ I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should continue to — I know that it is paying me a very great compliment , and I feel most undeservedly honoured ; but I am so perfectly convinced , and I

Fanny Price	pretty	By convincing her that Fanny _ was _ very pretty , which she had been doubting about before , and that she would be advantageously married 
Fanny Price	sure	Fanny coloured , and doubted at first what to say ; when , hoping to assail her on her vulnerable side , she presently answered — “ My dear aunt , _ you _ can not wish me to do differently from what I have done , I am sure . 
Fanny Price	sure	Yes , I am sure you would miss me too much for that . ” 
Fanny Price	sure	They sat so much longer than usual in the dining - parlour , that she was sure they must be talking of her ; and when tea at last brought them away , and she was to be seen by Edmund again , she felt dreadfully guilty . 
Fanny Price	worth	Fanny was worth it all ; he held her to be worth every effort of patience , every exertion of mind , but he did not think he could have gone on himself 
Fanny Price	worth	Fanny was worth it all ; he held her to be worth every effort of patience , every exertion of mind , but he did not think he could have gone on himself 
Fanny Price	sure	stepping eagerly to Fanny , and addressing her in a softened voice ; and upon her saying “ No , ” he added , “ Are you sure you did not speak ? 
Fanny Price	speechless	Fanny , meanwhile , vexed with herself for not having been as motionless as she was speechless , and grieved to the heart to see Edmund ’s arrangements , was trying by everything in the power of her modest , gentle nature , to repulse Mr. Crawford , and avoid both his looks and inquiries ; and he , unrepulsable , was persisting in both . 
Fanny Price	superior	You are infinitely my superior in merit ; all _ that _ I know . 
Fanny Price	present	Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other ? 
Fanny Price	busy	She was at liberty , she was busy , she was protected . 
Fanny Price	afraid	“ I am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what I feel . ” 
Fanny Price	model	You have proved yourself upright and disinterested , prove yourself grateful and tender - hearted ; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always believed you born for . ” 
Fanny Price	sorry	You must be sorry for your own indifference . 
Fanny Price	serious	He is lively , you are serious ; but so much the better : his spirits will support yours . 
Fanny Price	mistaken	“ Before the play , I am much mistaken if _ Julia _ did not think he was paying her attentions . ” 
Fanny Price	aware	You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford . 
Fanny Price	aware	Fanny was too well aware of it to have anything to say ; and they walked on together some fifty yards in mutual silence and abstraction . 
Fanny Price	fond	I knew she was very fond of you ; but yet I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved , and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune . 
Fanny Price	angry	She is very angry with you , Fanny ; you must be prepared for that . 
Fanny Price	angry	“ I knew she would be very angry with me . ” “ My dearest Fanny , ” cried Edmund , pressing her arm closer to him , “ do not let the idea of her anger distress you . 
Fanny Price	sure	I am sure his sisters , rating him as they do , must have thought it so , supposing he had meant nothing . 
Fanny Price	object	As a sister , so partial and so angry , and so little scrupulous of what she said , and in another light so triumphant and secure , she was in every way an object of painful alarm . 
Fanny Price	safe	She was safe in the breakfast - room , with her aunt , when Miss Crawford did come ; and the first misery over , and Miss Crawford looking and speaking with much less particularity of expression than she had anticipated , Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse to be endured than a half - hour of moderate agitation . 
Fanny Price	aware	Now , I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you . When she comes to know the truth she will , very likely , wish me in Northamptonshire again ; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser , by a first wife , whom she is wild to get married , and wants Henry to take . 
Fanny Price	welcome	Now , I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you . When she comes to know the truth she will , very likely , wish me in Northamptonshire again ; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser , by a first wife , whom she is wild to get married , and wants Henry to take . 
Fanny Price	sure	I _ had _ my doubts at the time about her being right , for he has not even the air of a gentleman , and now I am sure she was wrong . 
Fanny Price	insensible	But are you so insensible as you profess yourself ? 
Fanny Price	conscious	You were as conscious as heart could desire . 
Fanny Price	afraid	“ I will not say , ” replied Fanny , “ that I was not half afraid at the time of its being so , for there was something in your look that frightened me , but not at first ; I was as unsuspicious of it at first — indeed , indeed I was . 
Fanny Price	unsuspicious	“ I will not say , ” replied Fanny , “ that I was not half afraid at the time of its being so , for there was something in your look that frightened me , but not at first ; I was as unsuspicious of it at first — indeed , indeed I was . 
Fanny Price	sensible	As to your brother ’s behaviour , certainly I was sensible of a particularity : I had been sensible of it some little time , perhaps two or three weeks ; but then I considered it as meaning nothing : I put it down as simply being his way , and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me .

Fanny Price	quiet	I was quiet , but I was not blind . 
Fanny Price	blind	I was quiet , but I was not blind . 
Fanny Price	pleased	and when he had left the room , she was better pleased that such a token of friendship had passed . 
Fanny Price	sick	He certainly wished her to go willingly , but he as certainly wished her to be heartily sick of home before her visit ended ; and that a little abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of Mansfield Park would bring her mind into a sober state , and incline her to a juster estimate of the value of that home of greater permanence , and equal comfort , of which she had the offer . 
Fanny Price	woman	Her father ’s house would , in all probability , teach her the value of a good income ; and he trusted that she would be the wiser and happier woman , all her life , for the experiment he had devised . Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures 
Fanny Price	addicted	Her father ’s house would , in all probability , teach her the value of a good income ; and he trusted that she would be the wiser and happier woman , all her life , for the experiment he had devised . Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures 
Fanny Price	able	At a distance , unassailed by his looks or his kindness , and safe from the perpetual irritation of knowing his heart , and striving to avoid his confidence , she should be able to reason herself into a properer state ; she should be able to think of him as in London , and arranging everything there , without wretchedness . 
Fanny Price	useful	, in the impartial flow of her own meditations , unbiased by his bewildering statements , she could not acknowledge any necessity for Fanny ’s ever going near a father and mother who had done without her so long , while she was so useful to herself . 
Fanny Price	struck	she could not help thinking her poor dear sister Price would feel it very unkind of her not to come by such an opportunity . William and Fanny were horror - struck at the idea . 
Fanny Price	affected	It made the substance of one other confidential discourse about Miss Crawford ; and Fanny was the more affected from feeling it to be the last time in which Miss Crawford ’s name would ever be mentioned between them with any remains of liberty . 
Fanny Price	able	it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving her the affectionate farewell of a brother . All this passed overnight , for the journey was to begin very early in the morning ; and when the small , diminished party met at breakfast , William and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage . CHAPTER XXXVIII The novelty of travelling , and the happiness of being with William , soon produced their natural effect on Fanny ’s spirits , when Mansfield Park was fairly left behind ; and by the time their first stage was ended , and they were to quit Sir Thomas ’s carriage , she was able to take leave of the old coachman , and send back proper messages , with cheerful looks . Of pleasant talk between the brother and sister there was no end . 
Fanny Price	agitation	Fanny was all agitation and flutter ; all hope and apprehension . 
Fanny Price	flutter	Fanny was all agitation and flutter ; all hope and apprehension . 
Fanny Price	satisfied	Would they but love her , she should be satisfied . 
Fanny Price	dark	But here is my sister , sir ; here is Fanny , ” turning and leading her forward ; “ it is so dark you do not see her . 
Fanny Price	sure	Susan and an attendant girl , whose inferior appearance informed Fanny , to her great surprise , that she had previously seen the upper servant , brought in everything necessary for the meal ; Susan looking , as she put the kettle on the fire and glanced at her sister , as if divided between the agreeable triumph of shewing her activity and usefulness , and the dread of being thought to demean herself by such an office . “ She had been into the kitchen , ” she said , “ to hurry Sally and help make the toast , and spread the bread and butter , or she did not know when they should have got tea , and she was sure her sister must want something after her journey . 
Fanny Price	thankful	Fanny was very thankful . 
Fanny Price	silent	” Fanny was silent ; but not from being convinced that there might not be a remedy found for some of these evils . 
Fanny Price	shocked	” Fanny was quite shocked . 
Fanny Price	thankful	Fanny , fatigued and fatigued again , was thankful to accept the first invitation of going to bed ; and before Betsey had finished her cry at being allowed to sit up only one hour extraordinary in honour of sister , she was off , leaving all below in confusion and noise again ; the boys begging for toasted cheese , her father calling out for his rum and water , and Rebecca never where she ought to be . 
Fanny Price	tender	She is tender , and not used to rough it like the rest of us . 
Fanny Price	able	She had never been able to recall anything approaching to tenderness in his former treatment of herself . 
Fanny Price	sensible	would have been a more respectable mother of nine children on a small income . Much of all this Fanny could not but be sensible of . 
Fanny Price	anxious	Fanny was very anxious to be useful , and not to appear above her home , or in any way disqualified or disinclined , by her foreign education , from contributing her help to its comforts , and therefore set about working for Sam immediately ; and by working early and late , with perseverance and great despatch , did so much that the boy was shipped off at last , with more than half his linen ready . 
Fanny Price	right	The doors were in constant banging , the stairs were never at rest , nothing was done without a clatter , nobody sat still , and nobody could command attention when they spoke . In a review of the two houses , as they appeared to her before the end of a week , Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson ’s celebrated judgment as to matrimony and celibacy , and say , that though Mansfield Park might have some pains , Portsmouth could have no pleasures . CHAPTER XL Fanny was right enough in not expecting to hear from Miss Crawford now at the rapid rate in which their correspondence had begun ; Mary ’s next letter was after a decidedly longer interval than the last , but she was not right in supposing that such an interval would be felt a great relief to herself . 
Fanny Price	glad	She was really glad to receive the letter when it did come . 
Fanny Price	unwilling	I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a _ young _ one . 
Fanny Price	weeks	One morning , about this time , Fanny having now been nearly four weeks from Mansfield , a point which she never failed to think over and calculate every day , as she and Susan were preparing to remove , as usual , upstairs , they were stopped by the knock of a visitor , whom they felt they could not avoid , from Rebecca ’s alertness in going to the door , a duty which always interested her beyond any other . 
Fanny Price	able	Good sense , like hers , will always act when really called upon ; and she found that she had been able to name him to her mother , and recall her remembrance of the name , as that of “ William ’s friend , ” though she could not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable at such a moment . 
Fanny Price	ashamed	She was ashamed , and she would have been yet more ashamed of her father than of all the rest . 
Fanny Price	able	By the time he had given all this information , it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to ; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye , and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London ; that she had sent her best and kindest love , but had had no time for writing ; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour , having spent scarcely twenty - four hours in London , after his return from Norfolk , before he set off again ; that her cousin Edmund was in town , had been in town , he understood , a few days ; that he had not seen him himself , but that he was well , had left them all well at Mansfield , and was to dine , as yesterday , with the Frasers . 
Fanny Price	sorry	, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute ’s privacy for telling Fanny that his only business in Portsmouth was to see her ; that he was come down for a couple of days on her account , and hers only , and because he could not endure a longer total separation . She was sorry , really sorry ; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said , she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him ; he was much more gentle , obliging , and attentive to other people ’s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield ; she had never seen him so agreeable — so _ near _ being agreeable ; his behaviour to her father could not offend , and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of Susan . He was decidedly improved . 
Fanny Price	nice	_ She _ was nice only from natural delicacy , but _ he _ had been brought up in a school of luxury and epicurism . 
Fanny Price	reckoner	“ You are a most accurate and honest reckoner . 
Fanny Price	tired	“ I wish you were not so tired , ” said he , still detaining Fanny after all the others were in the house—“I wish I left you in stronger health . 
Fanny Price	equal	She was so little equal to Rebecca ’s puddings and Rebecca ’s hashes , brought to table , as they all were , with such accompaniments of half - cleaned plates , and not half - cleaned knives and forks , that she was very often constrained to defer her heartiest meal till she could send her brothers in the evening for biscuits and buns . 
Fanny Price	low	She was very low . 
Fanny Price	tired	You should listen to me till you were tired , and advise me till you were still tired more ; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper , so I will abstain altogether , and leave you to guess what you like . 
Fanny Price	lazy	I ought to have sent you an account of your cousin ’s first party , but I was lazy , and now it is too long 
Fanny Price	oracle	Fanny was her oracle . 
Fanny Price	addition	Fanny ’s explanations and remarks were a most important addition to every essay , or every chapter of history . 
Fanny Price	likely	Were _ she _ likely to have a home to invite her to , what a blessing it would be ! 
Fanny Price	aware	You are probably aware of this already . 
Fanny Price	sure	They are very fond of her ; but I am sure she does not love them as she loves you . 
Fanny Price	ready	When I think of her great attachment to you , indeed , and the whole of her judicious , upright conduct as a sister , she appears a very different creature , capable of everything noble , and I am ready to blame myself for a too harsh construction of a playful manner . 
Fanny Price	jealous	It is the influence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous of . 
Fanny Price	justified	That would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices , which , in fact , I am scarcely justified in asking ; and , if I am refused , that , I think , will be the honest motive . 
Fanny Price	able	I shall be able to write much that I could not say , and shall be giving her time for reflection before she resolves on her answer , and I am less afraid of the result of reflection than of an immediate hasty impulse ; I think I am . 
Fanny Price	afraid	I shall be able to write much that I could not say , and shall be giving her time for reflection before she resolves on her answer , and I am less afraid of the result of reflection than of an immediate hasty impulse ; I think I am . 
Fanny Price	satisfied	I am more and more satisfied with all that I see and hear of him . 
Fanny Price	sorry	I saw him draw back surprised , and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any former supposed slight to Miss Bertram . 
Fanny Price	happy	You are happy at Portsmouth , I hope , but this must not be a yearly visit . 
Fanny Price	glad	I am glad of it . 
Fanny Price	softened	She was soon more softened and sorrowful . 
Fanny Price	sorrowful	She was soon more softened and sorrowful . 
Fanny Price	sure	I am sure he has been very ill . 
Fanny Price	glad	I am quite grieved for him , and very much frightened , and so is Sir Thomas ; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me . 
Fanny Price	inclined	There was not only the debility of recent illness to assist : there was also , as she now learnt , nerves much affected , spirits much depressed to calm and raise , and her own imagination added that there must be a mind to be properly guided . The family were not consumptive , and she was more inclined to hope than fear for her cousin , except when she thought of Miss Crawford ; but Miss Crawford gave her the idea of being the child of good luck , and to her selfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only son . Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten . 
Fanny Price	good	This is my modest request and expectation , for you are so good , that I depend upon being treated better than I deserve , and I write now to beg an immediate 
Fanny Price	sure	If it be so , I am sure you must be included in that part , that discerning part , and therefore entreat you to let me know how far I have been rightly informed . 
Fanny Price	rejoiced	I need not say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been any mistake , but the report is so prevalent that I confess I can not help trembling . 
Fanny Price	agitated	I really am quite agitated on the subject . 
Fanny Price	one	Had the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you , but you are now the only one I can apply to for the truth , his sisters not being within my reach . 
Fanny Price	holidays	I suppose Mrs. R. ’s Easter holidays will not last much longer ; no doubt they are thorough holidays to her . 
Fanny Price	sure	I am sure it will be all hushed up , and nothing proved but Rushworth ’s folly . 
Fanny Price	uncomfortable	Very uncomfortable she was , and must continue , till she heard from Miss Crawford again . 
Fanny Price	deep	She was deep in other musing . 
Fanny Price	ready	She was ready to sink as she entered the parlour . 
Fanny Price	ready	When shall you be ready ? 
Fanny Price	able	Her aunt was no very methodical narrator , but with the help of some letters to and from Sir Thomas , and what she already knew herself , and could reasonably combine , she was soon able to understand quite as much as she wished of the circumstances attending the story . 
Fanny Price	mistaken	She was mistaken , however , in supposing that Edmund gave his father no present pain . 
Fanny Price	astonished	She was astonished , exceedingly astonished — more than astonished . 
Fanny Price	careless	but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear . 
Fanny Price	excellent	Till that happened , they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone , and how she had attached him , and how delightful nature had made her , and how excellent she would have been , had she fallen into good hands earlier . 
Fanny Price	useful	She was returned to Mansfield Park , she was useful , she was beloved ; she was safe from Mr. Crawford ; and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits , of his perfect approbation and increased regard ; and happy as all this must make her , she would still have been happy without any of it , for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford . 
Fanny Price	beloved	She was returned to Mansfield Park , she was useful , she was beloved ; she was safe from Mr. Crawford ; and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits , of his perfect approbation and increased regard ; and happy as all this must make her , she would still have been happy without any of it , for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford . 
Fanny Price	safe	She was returned to Mansfield Park , she was useful , she was beloved ; she was safe from Mr. Crawford ; and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits , of his perfect approbation and increased regard ; and happy as all this must make her , she would still have been happy without any of it , for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford . 
Fanny Price	happy	She was returned to Mansfield Park , she was useful , she was beloved ; she was safe from Mr. Crawford ; and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits , of his perfect approbation and increased regard ; and happy as all this must make her , she would still have been happy without any of it , for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford . 
Fanny Price	reward	Would he have persevered , and uprightly , Fanny must have been his reward , and a reward very voluntarily bestowed , within a reasonable period from Edmund ’s marrying Mary . 
Fanny Price	old	Loving , guiding , protecting her , as he had been doing ever since her being ten years old , her mind in so great a degree formed by his care , and her comfort depending on his kindness , an object to him of such close and peculiar interest , dearer by all his own importance with her than any one else at Mansfield , what was there now to add , but that he should learn to prefer soft light eyes to sparkling dark ones . 
Fanny Price	good	She was of course only too good for him ; but as nobody minds having what is too good for them , he was very steadily earnest in the pursuit of the blessing , and it was not possible that encouragement from her should be long wanting . 
Fanny Price	daughter	Fanny was indeed the daughter that he wanted . 
Fanny Price	welcome	With quickness in understanding the tempers of those she had to deal with , and no natural timidity to restrain any consequent wishes , she was soon welcome and useful to all ; and after Fanny ’s removal succeeded so naturally to her influence over the hourly comfort of her aunt , as gradually to become , perhaps , the most beloved of the two . 
Fanny Price	useful	With quickness in understanding the tempers of those she had to deal with , and no natural timidity to restrain any consequent wishes , she was soon welcome and useful to all ; and after Fanny ’s removal succeeded so naturally to her influence over the hourly comfort of her aunt , as gradually to become , perhaps , the most beloved of the two . 
Fanny Price	able	On that event they removed to Mansfield ; and the Parsonage there , which , under each of its two former owners , Fanny had never been able to approach but with some painful sensation of restraint or alarm , soon grew as dear to her heart , and as thoroughly perfect in her eyes , 
Fanny Price	salutations	“ Miss Price all alone ” and “ My dear Fanny , how comes this ? ” were the first salutations . 
Fanny Price	good	“ Or if we are , Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll : the grove of oak on the knoll . ” 
Fanny Price	admirer	After another pause , he went on—“Pray , Miss Price , are you such a great admirer of this Mr. Crawford as some people are ? 
Fanny Price	good	After a pause of perplexity , some eyes began to be turned towards Fanny , and a voice or two to say , “ If Miss Price would be so good as to _ read _ the part . ” 
Fanny Price	likely	” “ I shall keep clear of you , Crawford , as long as I can , ” said Edmund ; “ for you would be more likely to disconcert me , and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man . ” 
Fanny Price	object	She was the first object of his love , but it was a love which his stronger spirits , and bolder temper , made it as natural for him to express as to feel . 
Edmund Bertram	kind	Edmund was uniformly kind himself ; and she had nothing worse to endure on the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of seventeen will always think fair with a child of ten . 
Edmund Bertram	old	, removed first to the Park , and afterwards to a small house of Sir Thomas ’s in the village , and consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him ; and for her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy . The living was hereafter for Edmund ; and , had his uncle died a few years sooner , it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders . 
Edmund Bertram	absent	Edmund was absent at this time , or the evil would have been earlier remedied . 
Edmund Bertram	displeased	He would be at home in September , and where would be the harm of only waiting till September ? Though Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than with his mother , as evincing least regard for her niece , he could not help paying more attention to what she said ; and at length determined on a method of proceeding which would obviate the risk of his father ’s thinking he had done too much , and at the same time procure for Fanny the immediate means of exercise , which he could not bear she should be without . 
Edmund Bertram	pleased	He could allow his sister to be the best judge of her own happiness , but he was not pleased that her happiness should centre in a large income ; nor could he refrain from 
Edmund Bertram	satisfied	But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price . 
Edmund Bertram	glad	Mr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his acquiescence , and tried to make out something complimentary ; but , between his submission to _ her _ taste , and his having always intended the same himself , with the superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies in general , and of insinuating that there was one only whom he was anxious to please , he grew puzzled , and Edmund was glad to put an end to his speech by a proposal of wine . 
Edmund Bertram	sorry	” Edmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford , whom he was much disposed to admire , speak so freely of her uncle . 
Edmund Bertram	astonished	“ I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it ! 
Edmund Bertram	glad	I am glad you saw it all as I did . 
Edmund Bertram	man	Without studying the business , however , or knowing what he was about , Edmund was beginning , at the end of a week of such intercourse , to be a good deal in love ; and to the credit of the lady it may be added that , without his being a man of the world or an elder brother , without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk , he began to be agreeable to her . 
Edmund Bertram	elder	Without studying the business , however , or knowing what he was about , Edmund was beginning , at the end of a week of such intercourse , to be a good deal in love ; and to the credit of the lady it may be added that , without his being a man of the world or an elder brother , without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small talk , he began to be agreeable to her . 
Edmund Bertram	fond	Edmund was fond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford , but he seemed to think it enough that the Admiral had since been spared ; and she scrupled to point out her own remarks to him , lest it should appear like ill - nature . 
Edmund Bertram	sure	You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa . ” Before half this was said , Fanny was returned to her seat at the table , and had taken up her work again ; and Julia , who was in high good - humour , from the pleasures of the day , did her the justice of exclaiming , “ I must say , ma’am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . ” “ Fanny , ” said Edmund , after looking at her attentively , “ I am sure you have the headache . ” She could not deny it , but said it was not very bad . “ I can hardly believe you , ” he replied ; “ I know your looks too well . 
Edmund Bertram	angry	Vexed as Edmund was with his mother and aunt , he was still more angry with himself . 
Edmund Bertram	ashamed	He was ashamed to think that for four days together she had not had the power of riding , and very seriously resolved , however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of Miss Crawford ’s , that it should never happen again . 
Edmund Bertram	unwilling	He was ashamed to think that for four days together she had not had the power of riding , and very seriously resolved , however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of Miss Crawford ’s , that it should never happen again . 
Edmund Bertram	happy	She will have a companion in Fanny Price , you know , so it will all do very well ; and as for Edmund , as he is not here to speak for himself , I will answer for his being most happy to join the party . 
Edmund Bertram	thankful	Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangement which restored him to his share of the party ; and Mrs. Norris thought it an excellent plan , and had it at her tongue ’s end , and was on the point of proposing it , when Mrs. Grant spoke . Wednesday was fine , and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived , Mr. Crawford driving his sisters ; and as everybody was ready , there was nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take their places . 
Edmund Bertram	fit	You really are fit for something better . 
Edmund Bertram	being	I am a very matter - of - fact , plain - spoken being , and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out . ” 
Edmund Bertram	tired	I hope you are not very tired . 
Edmund Bertram	in	“ Not half a mile , ” was his sturdy answer ; for he was not yet so much in love as to measure distance , or reckon time , with feminine lawlessness . 
Edmund Bertram	afraid	“ I am afraid you are very tired , Fanny , ” said Edmund , observing her ; “ why would not you speak sooner ? 
Edmund Bertram	ashamed	I am ashamed of you and of myself , but it shall never happen again . ” 
Edmund Bertram	sure	I hope I should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way , and I am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it . 
Edmund Bertram	sure	“ There goes good - humour , I am sure , ” said he presently . 
Edmund Bertram	afraid	Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from Maria ; and I am not at all afraid for her , after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong . 
Edmund Bertram	glad	“ I am glad of it , ” said he , in a much brisker tone , and throwing down the newspaper again , “ for I am tired to death . 
Edmund Bertram	tired	“ I am glad of it , ” said he , in a much brisker tone , and throwing down the newspaper again , “ for I am tired to death . 
Edmund Bertram	determined	He was determined to prevent it , if possible , though his mother , who equally heard the conversation which passed at table , did not evince the least disapprobation . 
Edmund Bertram	sure	And as to my father ’s being absent , it is so far from an objection , that I consider it rather as a motive ; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother ; and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety , and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks , I shall think our time very well spent , and so , I am sure , will he . 
Edmund Bertram	bystander	His being only a bystander was not disclaimed . 
Edmund Bertram	adviser	Mr. Edmund Bertram , as you do not act yourself , you will be a disinterested adviser ; and , therefore , I apply to _ you _ . 
Edmund Bertram	angry	Edmund was too angry to speak ; but Miss Crawford , looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris , and then at Fanny , whose tears were beginning to shew themselves , immediately said , with some keenness , “ I do not like my situation : this _ place _ is too hot for me , ” and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table , close to Fanny , saying to her , in a kind , low whisper , as she placed herself , “ Never mind , my dear Miss Price , this is a cross evening : everybody is cross and teasing , but do not let us mind them ” ; 
Edmund Bertram	champion	what was yet more frequent or more dear , Edmund had been her champion and her friend : he had supported her cause or explained her meaning , he had told her not to cry , or had given her some proof of affection which made her tears delightful ; and the whole was now so blended together , so harmonised by distance , that every former affliction had its charm . The room was most dear to her , and she would not have changed its furniture for the handsomest in the house , though what had been originally plain had suffered all the ill - usage of children ; and its greatest elegancies and ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia ’s work , too ill done for the drawing - room , three transparencies , made in a rage for transparencies , for the three lower panes of one window , where Tintern Abbey held its station between a cave in Italy and a moonlight lake in Cumberland , a collection of family profiles , thought unworthy of being anywhere else , over the mantelpiece , and by their side , and pinned against the wall , a small sketch of a ship sent four years ago from the Mediterranean by William , with H.M.S. Antwerp at the bottom , in letters as tall as the mainmast . 
Edmund Bertram	satisfied	Edmund was satisfied . “ I shall walk down immediately after breakfast , ” said he , “ and am sure of giving pleasure there . 
Edmund Bertram	right	“ He was certainly right in respecting such feelings ; he was glad he had determined on it . ” 
Edmund Bertram	glad	“ He was certainly right in respecting such feelings ; he was glad he had determined on it . ” 
Edmund Bertram	unobservant	Edmund , between his theatrical and his real part , between Miss Crawford ’s claims and his own conduct , between love and consistency , was equally unobservant ; and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company , superintending their various dresses with economical expedient , for which nobody thanked her , and saving , with delighted integrity , half a crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas , to have leisure for watching the behaviour , or guarding the happiness of his daughters . 
Edmund Bertram	cousin	But then he is your cousin , which makes all the difference . 
Edmund Bertram	first	Edmund was the first to speak — “ Something must be done , ” said he . 
Edmund Bertram	more	“ I grant you the name is good in itself , and _ Lord _ Edmund or _ Sir _ Edmund sound delightfully ; but sink it under the chill , the annihilation of a Mr. , and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas . 
Edmund Bertram	glad	“ My dear child , commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St. Paul ’s , and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be . 
Edmund Bertram	sure	“ If you put such a question to her , ” cried Edmund , preventing his cousin ’s speaking , “ Fanny will immediately say No ; but I am sure , 
Edmund Bertram	hoarse	I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night . 
Edmund Bertram	glad	I shall be very glad to see him . 
Edmund Bertram	sure	The house must be turned to front the east instead of the north — the entrance and principal rooms , I mean , must be on that side , where the view is really very pretty ; I am sure it may be done . 
Edmund Bertram	clergyman	Edmund might , in the common phrase , do the duty of Thornton , that is , he might read prayers and preach , without giving up Mansfield Park : he might ride over every Sunday , to a house nominally inhabited , and go through divine service ; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day , for three or four hours , if that would content him . 
Edmund Bertram	full	Edmund was at this time particularly full of cares : his mind being deeply occupied in the consideration of two important events now at hand , which were to fix his fate in life — ordination and matrimony — events of such a serious character as to make the ball , which would be very quickly followed by one of them , appear of less moment in his eyes than in those of any other person in the house . 
Edmund Bertram	gratified	for Edmund was so struck with the circumstance , so delighted with what Miss Crawford had done , so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct between them , that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one pleasure over his own mind , though it might have its drawback . 
Edmund Bertram	decided	It was some time before she could get his attention to her plan , or any answer to her demand of his opinion : he was in a reverie of fond reflection , uttering only now and then a few half - sentences of praise ; but when he did awake and understand , he was very decided in opposing what she wished . 
Edmund Bertram	sure	I think , I hope , I am sure she is not serious ; but I would rather not hear it . 
Edmund Bertram	right	“ You are right , Fanny , to protest against such an office , but you need not be afraid . 
Edmund Bertram	pleasing	He is a very — a very pleasing young man himself , and I can not help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London , as will now undoubtedly be the case . 
Edmund Bertram	man	He is a very — a very pleasing young man himself , and I can not help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London , as will now undoubtedly be the case . 
Edmund Bertram	one	Was his letter a long one ? 
Edmund Bertram	concise	concise 
Edmund Bertram	kind	True , I believe he is , generally speaking , kind to her , and so is Sir Thomas in his way ; but it is the way of a rich , superior , long - worded , arbitrary uncle . 
Edmund Bertram	ready	it was so little , so very , very little — every chance , every possibility of it , resting upon her embarrassment only ; if there was not hope in her confusion , there was hope in nothing else — that he was almost ready to wonder at his friend ’s perseverance . 
Edmund Bertram	willing	He was very willing to hope that Crawford saw clearer , and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his friend that he could come to from all that he observed to pass before , and at , and after dinner . 
Edmund Bertram	pleased	Edmund had already gone through the service once since his ordination ; and upon this being understood , he had a variety of questions from Crawford as to his feelings and success ; questions , which being made , though with the vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste , without any touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew to be most offensive to Fanny , he had true pleasure in satisfying ; and when Crawford proceeded to ask his opinion and give his own as to the properest manner in which particular passages in the service should be delivered , shewing it to be a subject on which he had thought before , and thought with judgment , Edmund was still more and more pleased . 
Edmund Bertram	fond	And I do not know that I should be fond of preaching often ; now and then , perhaps once or twice in the spring , after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together ; but not for a constancy ; it would not do for a constancy . ” 
Edmund Bertram	sorry	Edmund was not sorry to be admitted again among the number of those who might speak and hear . 
Edmund Bertram	unwilling	Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business ; he wanted to know Fanny ’s feelings . 
Edmund Bertram	careless	Were I even careless in general on such matters , how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake ? ” “ My uncle thought me wrong , and I knew he had been talking to you . ” “ As far as you have gone , Fanny , I think you perfectly right . 
Edmund Bertram	surprised	I may be sorry , I may be surprised — though hardly _ that _ , for you had not had time to attach yourself — but I think you perfectly right . 
Edmund Bertram	aware	I am aware , more aware than Crawford can be , that the man who means to make you love him ( you having due notice of his intentions ) must have very uphill work , for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array ; and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate , which so many years ’ growth have confirmed , and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation . 
Edmund Bertram	ready	Crawford ’s _ feelings _ , I am ready to acknowledge , have hitherto been too much his guides . 
Edmund Bertram	able	Well , though I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings , you will be persuaded into them , I trust . 
Edmund Bertram	afraid	I knew she was very fond of you ; but yet I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved , and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune . 
Edmund Bertram	afraid	I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims , which she has been too much used to hear . 
Edmund Bertram	spoilt	But I am spoilt , Fanny , for common female society . 
Edmund Bertram	gone	In this occupation she hoped , moreover , to bury some of the recollections of Mansfield , which were too apt to seize her mind if her fingers only were busy ; and , especially at this time , hoped it might be useful in diverting her thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London , whither , on the authority of her aunt ’s last letter , she knew he was gone . 
Edmund Bertram	happy	Either his going had been again delayed , or he had yet procured no opportunity of seeing Miss Crawford alone , or he was too happy for letter - writing ! 
Edmund Bertram	lazy	“ Have you no message for anybody ? ” “ My love to your sister , if you please ; and when you see my cousin , my cousin Edmund , I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him . ” “ Certainly ; and if he is lazy or negligent , I will write his excuses myself . ” He could say no more , for Fanny would be no longer detained . 
Edmund Bertram	negligent	“ Have you no message for anybody ? ” “ My love to your sister , if you please ; and when you see my cousin , my cousin Edmund , I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him . ” “ Certainly ; and if he is lazy or negligent , I will write his excuses myself . ” He could say no more , for Fanny would be no longer detained . 
Edmund Bertram	able	find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be apprehended , and that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield shortly , which Sir Thomas proposes should be done , and thinks best on 
Edmund Bertram	companion	She could do nothing but glide in quietly and look at him ; but when able to talk or be talked to , or read to , Edmund was the companion he preferred . 
Edmund Bertram	ready	Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman , it seemed , under certain conditions of wealth ; and this , she suspected , was all the conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate himself upon . 
Edmund Bertram	sure	Settle it as you like ; say what is proper ; I am sure you will feel such an instance of his kindness at such a moment ! 
Edmund Bertram	alone	He was alone , and met her instantly ; and she found herself pressed to his heart with only these words , just articulate , “ My Fanny , my only sister ; my only comfort now ! ” 
Edmund Bertram	alone	Had he been alone with her , his heart must have opened in spite of every resolution ; but Susan ’s presence drove him quite into himself , and his attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never be long supported 
Edmund Bertram	welcome	Edmund was almost as welcome to his brother as Fanny to her aunt ; but Mrs. Norris , instead of having comfort from either , was but the more irritated by the sight of the person whom , in the blindness of her anger , she could have charged as the daemon of the piece . 
Edmund Bertram	brief	Sitting with her on Sunday evening — a wet Sunday evening — the very time of all others when , if a friend is at hand , the heart must be opened , and everything told ; no one else in the room , except his mother , who , after hearing an affecting sermon , had cried herself to sleep , it was impossible not to speak ; and so , with the usual beginnings , hardly to be traced as to what came first , and the usual declaration that if she would listen to him for a few minutes , he should be very brief , and certainly never tax her kindness in the same way again ; she need not fear a repetition ; it would be a subject prohibited entirely : he entered upon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the first interest to himself , to one of whose affectionate sympathy he was quite convinced . 
Edmund Bertram	able	She had met him , he said , with a serious — certainly a serious — even an agitated air ; but before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence , she had introduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him . 
Edmund Bertram	affected	After repeating this , Edmund was so much affected that Fanny , watching him with silent , but most tender concern , was almost sorry that the subject had been entered on at all . 
Edmund Bertram	apt	giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past . 
Edmund Bertram	right	I have since , sometimes , for a moment , regretted that I did not go back , but I know I was right , and such has been the end of our acquaintance . 
Edmund Bertram	dupe	She was returned to Mansfield Park , she was useful , she was beloved ; she was safe from Mr. Crawford ; and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits , of his perfect approbation and increased regard ; and happy as all this must make her , she would still have been happy without any of it , for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford . 
Edmund Bertram	afraid	I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	able	Miss Ward ’s match , indeed , when it came to the point , was not contemptible : Sir Thomas being happily able to give his friend an income in the living of Mansfield ; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their career of conjugal felicity with very little less than a thousand a year . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	glad	from principle as well as pride — from a general wish of doing right , and a desire of seeing all that were connected with him in situations of respectability , he would have been glad to exert for the advantage of Lady Bertram ’s sister ; but her husband ’s profession was such as no interest could reach ; and before he had time to devise any other method of assisting them , an absolute breach between the sisters had taken place . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	affectionate	Sir Thomas did not know what was wanting , because , though a truly anxious father , he was not outwardly affectionate , and the reserve of his manner repressed all the flow of their spirits before him . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	able	There was another family living actually held for Edmund ; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir Thomas ’s conscience , he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice , and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction , in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been able to say or do . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	friend	Sir Thomas is too much my friend . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	happy	Sir Thomas , however , was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance so unquestionably advantageous , and of which he heard nothing but the perfectly good and agreeable . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	unlucky	“ To be sure , my dear mother , your anxiety — I was unlucky there . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	answerable	” “ For everything of that nature I will be answerable , ” said Tom , in a decided tone . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	angry	No ; you must excuse me ; I can not retract my consent ; it is too far settled , everybody would be so disappointed , Tom would be quite angry ; and if we are so very nice , we shall never act anything . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	happy	Such a forward young lady may well frighten the men . ” “ I should be but too happy in taking the part , if it were possible , ” cried Tom ; “ but , unluckily , the Butler and Anhalt are in together . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	afraid	I could name , at this moment , at least six young men within six miles of us , who are wild to be admitted into our company , and there are one or two that would not disgrace us : I should not be afraid to trust either of the Olivers or Charles Maddox . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	good	I am sure _ Julia _ does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends 
Sir Thomas Bertram	unintelligible	_ She _ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant dreadfully ; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford ; that Tom Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible ; that Mrs. Grant spoiled everything by laughing ; that Edmund was behindhand with his part , and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth , who was wanting a prompter through every speech . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	life	Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the party , who at his suggestion now seated themselves round the fire . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	ready	He had the best right to be the talker ; and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own house , in the centre of his family , after such a separation , made him communicative and chatty in a very unusual degree ; and he was ready to give every information as to his voyage , and answer every question of his two sons almost before it was put . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	sure	It would be the last — in all probability — the last scene on that stage ; but he was sure there could not be a finer . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	cautious	That I should be cautious and quick - sighted , and feel many scruples which my children do _ not _ feel , is perfectly natural ; and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity , for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures , should much exceed theirs . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	sensible	But at your time of life to feel all this , is a most favourable circumstance for yourself , and for everybody connected with you ; and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	aware	He was aware that he must not expect a genius in Mr. Rushworth ; but as a well - judging , steady young man , with better notions than his elocution would do justice to , he intended to value him very highly . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	anxious	He was anxious , while vindicating himself , to say nothing unkind of the others : but there was only one amongst them whose conduct he could mention without some necessity of defence or palliation . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	willing	He did not enter into any remonstrance with his other children : he was more willing to believe they felt their error than to run the risk of investigation . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	sorry	He could immediately say with easy fluency , “ I am sorry you are going ; but as to our play , _ that _ is all over — entirely at an end ” ( looking significantly at his father ) . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	wearisome	In himself he was wearisome , but as the friend of Tom and the admirer of Julia he became offensive . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	indifferent	Sir Thomas had been quite indifferent to Mr. Crawford ’s going or staying : but his good wishes for Mr. Yates ’s having a pleasant journey , as he walked with him to the hall - door , were given with genuine satisfaction . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	mistaken	She thanked him for his great attention , his paternal kindness , but he was quite mistaken in supposing she had the smallest desire of breaking through her engagement , or was sensible of any change of opinion or inclination since her forming it . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	satisfied	Sir Thomas was satisfied ; too glad to be satisfied , perhaps , to urge the matter quite so far as his judgment might have dictated to others . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	surprised	But he will be very much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	present	There was nothing more to be said , or that could be said to any purpose , till Sir Thomas were present ; but the subject involving , as it did , her own evening ’s comfort for the morrow , was so much uppermost in Lady Bertram ’s mind , that half an hour afterwards , on his looking in for a minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing - room , she called him back again , when he had almost closed the door , with “ Sir Thomas , stop a moment — I have something to say to you . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	happy	“ I repeat again , ” added Sir Thomas , “ that Thornton Lacey is the only house in the neighbourhood in which I should _ not _ be happy to wait on Mr. Crawford as occupier . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	proud	Sir Thomas himself was watching her progress down the dance with much complacency ; he was proud of his niece ; and without attributing all her personal beauty , as Mrs. Norris seemed to do , to her transplantation to Mansfield , he was pleased with himself for having supplied everything else : education and manners she owed to him . Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas ’s thoughts as he stood , and having , in spite of all his wrongs towards her , a general prevailing desire of recommending herself to him , took an opportunity of stepping aside to say something agreeable of Fanny .

Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas ’s thoughts as he stood , and having , in spite of all his wrongs towards her , a general prevailing desire of recommending herself to him , took an opportunity of stepping aside to say something agreeable of Fanny . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	sure	Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	joyful	Thomas was as joyful as she could desire , and very kind and communicative ; and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William as to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her , till she found , towards the close , that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and dine there that very day . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	kind	Thomas was as joyful as she could desire , and very kind and communicative ; and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William as to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her , till she found , towards the close , that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and dine there that very day . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	happy	Fanny ’s colour grew deeper and deeper ; and her uncle , perceiving that she was embarrassed to a degree that made either speaking or looking up quite impossible , turned away his own eyes , and without any farther pause proceeded in his account of Mr. Crawford ’s visit . Mr. Crawford ’s business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny , make decided proposals for her , and entreat the sanction of the uncle , who seemed to stand in the place of her parents ; and he had done it all so well , so openly , so liberally , so properly , that Sir Thomas , feeling , moreover , his own replies , and his own remarks to have been very much to the purpose , was exceedingly happy to give the particulars of their conversation ; and little aware of what was passing in his niece ’s mind , conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her far more than himself . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	aware	“ You must have been aware , ” continued Sir Thomas presently , “ you must have been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford ’s manners to you . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	inclined	I am half inclined to think , Fanny , that you do not quite know your own feelings . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	deep	He was deep in thought . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	an	I am an advocate for early marriages , where there are means in proportion , and would have every young man , with a sufficient income , settle as soon after four - and - twenty as he can . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	advocate	I am an advocate for early marriages , where there are means in proportion , and would have every young man , with a sufficient income , settle as soon after four - and - twenty as he can . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	sorry	This is so much my opinion , that I am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son , your cousin , Mr. Bertram , is to marry early ; but at present , as far as I can judge , matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	right	Am I right ? 
Sir Thomas Bertram	easy	Do you agree with me , my dear ? ” “ Yes , sir . ” It was gently , but it was calmly said , and Sir Thomas was easy on the score of the cousins . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	unequal	I am totally unequal to it . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	able	speedy comfort in the determined views and sanguine perseverance of the lover ; and when seeing such confidence of success in the principal , Sir Thomas was soon able to depend on it himself . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	anxious	Sir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of Mr. Crawford ’s character in that point . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	master	But he was master at Mansfield Park . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	least	she found that the best of the three younger ones was gone in him : Tom and Charles being at least as many years as they were his juniors distant from that age of feeling and reason , which might suggest the expediency of making friends , and of endeavouring to be less disagreeable . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	unkind	Fanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as she could , but she was within half a minute of starting the idea that Sir Thomas was quite unkind , both to her aunt and to herself . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	ill	I am sure he has been very ill . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	better	But Sir Thomas hopes he will be better to - morrow , and says we must consider his journey . ” The real solicitude now awakened in the maternal bosom was not soon over . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	much	I do n’t know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters ; he may be too much of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	aware	He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf , in addition to all the rest , when they were in town : he had seen or conjectured his feelings ; and , having reason to think that one interview with Miss Crawford had taken place , from which Edmund derived only increased distress , had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him out of town , and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt , with a view to his relief and benefit , no less than theirs . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	privy	Fanny was not in the secret of her uncle ’s feelings , Sir Thomas not in the secret of Miss Crawford ’s character . Had he been privy to her conversation with his son , he would not have wished her to belong to him , though her twenty thousand pounds had been forty . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	longest	Sir Thomas , poor Sir Thomas , a parent , and conscious of errors in his own conduct as a parent , was the longest to suffer . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	solid	He was not very solid ; but there was a hope 
Sir Thomas Bertram	domestic	of his becoming less trifling , of his being at least tolerably domestic and quiet ; and at any rate , there was comfort in finding his estate rather more , and his debts much less , than he had feared , and in being consulted and treated as the friend best worth attending to . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	better	He was the better for ever for his illness . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	aware	She had despised him , and loved another ; and he had been very much aware that it was so . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	accessory	Maria had destroyed her own character , and he would not , by a vain attempt to restore what never could be restored , by affording his sanction to vice , or in seeking to lessen its disgrace , be anywise accessory to introducing such misery in another man ’s family as he had known himself . 
Mary Crawford	free	Miss Crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions , though they arose principally from doubts of her sister ’s style of living and tone of society ; and it was not till after she had tried in vain to persuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house , that she could resolve to hazard herself among her other relations . 
Mary Crawford	glad	Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near them , and not at all displeased either at her sister ’s early care , or the choice it had fallen on . Matrimony was her object , provided she could marry well : and having seen Mr. Bertram in town , she knew that objection could no more be made to his person than to his situation in life . 
Mary Crawford	tall	Had she been tall , full formed , and fair , it might have been more of a trial : but as it was , there could be no comparison ; and she was most allowably a sweet , pretty girl , while they were the finest young women in the country . 
Mary Crawford	formed	Had she been tall , full formed , and fair , it might have been more of a trial : but as it was , there could be no comparison ; and she was most allowably a sweet , pretty girl , while they were the finest young women in the country . 
Mary Crawford	girl	Had she been tall , full formed , and fair , it might have been more of a trial : but as it was , there could be no comparison ; and she was most allowably a sweet , pretty girl , while they were the finest young women in the country . 
Mary Crawford	puzzled	I am puzzled . 
Mary Crawford	sure	It would be a very flat business , she was sure . 
Mary Crawford	glad	“ I am very glad that you have heard of it , by whatever means , and hope there will be no further delay . ” “ I am to have it to - morrow ; but how do you think it is to be conveyed ? 
Mary Crawford	happy	“ I shall be most happy to play to you both , ” said Miss Crawford ; “ at least as long as you can like to listen : probably much longer , for I dearly love music myself , and where the natural taste is equal 
Mary Crawford	pretty	She entertains me ; and she is so extremely pretty , that I have great pleasure in looking at her . 
Mary Crawford	circumstanced	She is awkwardly circumstanced . 
Mary Crawford	feminine	She is perfectly feminine , except in the instances we have been speaking of . 
Mary Crawford	equal	There was a charm , perhaps , in his sincerity , his steadiness , his integrity , which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel , though not equal to discuss with herself . 
Mary Crawford	glad	“ I do not want her at all for myself , ” said he ; “ but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home , I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time — for a whole morning , in short . 
Mary Crawford	equal	She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common : Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views , and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it . 
Mary Crawford	sorry	She would be extremely sorry to interfere with you . 
Mary Crawford	glad	I am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places . 
Mary Crawford	slow	Miss Crawford was not slow to admire ; she pretty well guessed Miss Bertram ’s feelings , and made it a point of honour to promote her enjoyment to the utmost . Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility ; and even Fanny had something to say in admiration , and might be heard with complacency . Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach ; and after being at some pains to get a view of the house , and observing that “ it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect , ” she added , “ Now , where is the avenue ? 
Mary Crawford	distressed	“ How distressed she will be at what she said just now 
Mary Crawford	lawyer	You must suppose me designed for some profession , and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer , nor a soldier , nor a sailor . ” 
Mary Crawford	happy	She has done no more than what every young woman would do ; and I have no doubt of her being extremely happy . 
Mary Crawford	addicted	“ I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle , ” said Miss Crawford , “ that I can hardly suppose — and since you push me so hard , I must observe , that I am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are , being at this present time the guest of my own brother , Dr. Grant . 
Mary Crawford	sure	“ You chose very wisely , I am sure , ” replied Miss Crawford , with a brightened look ; “ Anhalt is a heavy part . ” 
Mary Crawford	surprised	“ I am not at all surprised , ” said Miss Crawford , after a short pause , “ at this want of an Anhalt . 
Mary Crawford	sorry	“ _ I _ should have no objection , ” she replied ; “ for though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported , that is , if everything went well , I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience ; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _ that _ _ table _ ” ( looking round ) , “ it certainly will not be taken . ” Edmund said no more . 
Mary Crawford	sanguine	“ I am not very sanguine as to our play , ” said Miss Crawford , in an undervoice to Fanny , after some consideration ; “ and I can tell Mr. Maddox that I shall shorten some of _ his _ speeches , and a great many of _ my _ _ own _ , before we rehearse together . 
Mary Crawford	glad	I thought _ you _ would have entered more into Miss Crawford ’s feelings . ” “ No doubt she will be very glad . 
Mary Crawford	kind	“ She _ was _ very kind , indeed , and I am glad to have her spared ” ... 
Mary Crawford	right	“ Am I right ? 
Mary Crawford	right	“ Miss Crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day : that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect . 
Mary Crawford	sorry	I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . ” In this quarter , indeed , disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas . 
Mary Crawford	conscious	Miss Crawford , however , with renewed animation , soon went on — “ I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than I had ever expected to be . 
Mary Crawford	vexed	Miss Crawford was too much vexed by what had passed to be in a humour for anything but music . 
Mary Crawford	angry	She was very angry with him . 
Mary Crawford	perfect	His conviction of her regard for him was sometimes very strong ; he could look back on a long course of encouragement , and she was as perfect in disinterested attachment as in everything else . 
Mary Crawford	careless	He evidently tried to please her : he was gallant , he was attentive , he was something like what he had been to her cousins : he wanted , she supposed , to cheat her of her tranquillity as he had cheated them ; and whether he might not have some concern in this necklace — she could not be convinced that he had not , for Miss Crawford , complaisant as a sister , was careless as a woman and a friend . 
Mary Crawford	serious	She is not serious . 
Mary Crawford	serious	I think , I hope , I am sure she is not serious ; but I would rather not hear it . 
Mary Crawford	ashamed	I begin to think it most improbable : the chances grow less and less ; and even if it should , there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of , for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples ; and if they are removed , it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had . 
Mary Crawford	blockhead	every serious idea of her ; but I must be a blockhead indeed , if , whatever befell me , I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude . ” He had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen . 
Mary Crawford	tired	How can you be tired so soon ? ” 
Mary Crawford	good	I thank you ; I have quite done , just done ; it will be ready in a moment ; I am very much obliged to you ; if you will be so good as to give _ that _ to Miss Crawford 
Mary Crawford	slave	But here she hoped too much ; Miss Crawford was not the slave of opportunity . 
Mary Crawford	impatient	She was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receiving this than she had been before ; and for a few days was so unsettled by it altogether , by what had come , and what might come , that her usual readings and conversation with Susan were much suspended . She could not 
Mary Crawford	different	Had she been different when I did see her , I should have made no complaint , but from the very first she was altered 
Mary Crawford	affluent	She is a cold - hearted , vain woman , who has married entirely from convenience , and though evidently unhappy in her marriage , places her disappointment not to faults of judgment , or temper , or disproportion of age , but to her being , after all , less affluent than many of her acquaintance , especially than her sister , Lady Stornaway , and is the determined supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious , provided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough . 
Mary Crawford	woman	She is the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife . 
Mary Crawford	alarmed	Miss Crawford need not be alarmed for her . 
Mary Crawford	sorry	She was only sorry for the parties concerned and for Mansfield , if the report should spread so far ; but she hoped it might not . 
Mary Crawford	woman	, she could believe Miss Crawford to be the woman ! 
Mary Crawford	object	She was delighted with each , but Mary was her dearest object ; and having never been able to glory in beauty of her own 
Mary Crawford	sure	“ No , I am sure you are too good . 
Mary Crawford	satisfied	Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home , and Henry equally ready to lengthen his visit . 
Mary Crawford	angry	Angry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions , and acting on them in defiance of her ( and she had been so angry that they had hardly parted friends at the ball ) , she could not help thinking of him continually when absent , dwelling on his merit and affection , and longing again for the almost daily meetings they lately had . 
Mary Crawford	afraid	She was afraid she had used some strong , some contemptuous expressions in speaking of the clergy , and that should not have been . 
Mary Crawford	sorry	All this was bad , but she had still more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund ; when Saturday came and still no Edmund ; and when , through the slight communication with the other family which Sunday produced , she learned that he had actually written home to defer his return , having promised to remain some days longer with his friend . If she had felt impatience and regret before — if she had been sorry for what she said , and feared its too strong effect on him — she now felt and feared it all tenfold more . 
Mary Crawford	aware	No : you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price . ” The surprise was now complete ; for , in spite of whatever his consciousness might suggest , a suspicion of his having any such views had never entered his sister ’s imagination ; and she looked so truly the astonishment she felt , that he was obliged to repeat what he had said , and more fully and more solemnly . 
Mary Crawford	mistaken	No , Mary , you are quite mistaken . 
Mary Crawford	right	But you are quite right ; you could not have chosen better . 
Mary Crawford	pleasing	Were you even less pleasing — supposing her not to love you already ( of which , however , I can have little doubt)—you would be safe . 
Mary Crawford	glad	“ My dearest Henry , ” cried Mary , stopping short , and smiling in his face , “ how glad I am to see you so much in love ! 
Mary Crawford	delighted	I am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head , but I was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes . ” 
Mary Crawford	sure	I am sure it is not in woman ’s nature to refuse such a triumph . ” 
Mary Crawford	sure	“ I shall see your cousin in town soon : he talks of being there tolerably soon ; and Sir Thomas , I dare say , in the course of the spring ; and your eldest cousin , and the Rushworths , and Julia , I am sure of meeting again and again , and all but you . 
Mary Crawford	right	The doors were in constant banging , the stairs were never at rest , nothing was done without a clatter , nobody sat still , and nobody could command attention when they spoke . In a review of the two houses , as they appeared to her before the end of a week , Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson ’s celebrated judgment as to matrimony and celibacy , and say , that though Mansfield Park might have some pains , Portsmouth could have no pleasures . CHAPTER XL Fanny was right enough in not expecting to hear from Miss Crawford now at the rapid rate in which their correspondence had begun ; Mary ’s next letter was after a decidedly longer interval than the last , but she was not right in supposing that such an interval would be felt a great relief to herself . 
Henry Crawford	delighted	“ So they are indeed , and I am delighted to hear you say it . 
Henry Crawford	sure	I am sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth . 
Henry Crawford	eldest	acknowledged , however , that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men , that two such young men were not often seen together even in London , and that their manners , particularly those of the eldest , were very good . _ He _ had been much in London , and had more liveliness and gallantry than Edmund , and must , therefore , be preferred ; and , indeed , his being the eldest was another strong claim . 
Henry Crawford	afraid	“ I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly , ” was his reply , with a look of meaning . 
Henry Crawford	first	Mr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine the capabilities of that end of the house . 
Henry Crawford	foot	He is not five foot nine . 
Henry Crawford	foot	I should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight . 
Henry Crawford	fellow	I think he is an ill - looking fellow . 
Henry Crawford	fond	“ I am rather surprised , ” said she , “ that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon , after being here so long before , full seven weeks ; for I had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about , that I thought something would certainly occur , when he was once gone , to take him elsewhere . 
Henry Crawford	favourite	“ What a favourite he is with my cousins ! ” 
Henry Crawford	sure	Mr. Crawford desired _ that _ might not be thought of : he was very sure his sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful , and that she would not allow herself to be considered in the present case . 
Henry Crawford	actor	As far as she could judge , Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor of all : he had more confidence than Edmund , more judgment than Tom , more talent and taste than Mr. Yates . 
Henry Crawford	actor	She did not like him as a man , but she must admit him to be the best actor , and on this point there were not many who differed from her . 
Henry Crawford	much	Fanny , in her pity and kindheartedness , was at great pains to teach him how to learn , giving him all the helps and directions in her power , trying to make an artificial memory for him , and learning every word of his part herself , but without his being much the forwarder . Many uncomfortable , anxious , apprehensive feelings she certainly had ; but with all these , and other claims on her time and attention , she was as far from finding herself without employment or utility amongst them , as without a companion in uneasiness ; quite as far from having no demand on her leisure as on her compassion . 
Henry Crawford	girl	“ Mr. Crawford was a most pleasant , gentleman - like man ; his sister a sweet , pretty , elegant , lively girl . ” 
Henry Crawford	admirer	proceeded from good - breeding and goodwill alone , and had nothing to do with Mr. Crawford , but as being one in an agreeable group : for it was in the course of that very visit that he first began to think that any one in the habit of such idle observations _ would _ _ have _ _ thought _ that Mr. Crawford was the admirer of Fanny Price . 
Henry Crawford	sorry	As soon as a general buzz gave him shelter , he added , in a low voice , directed solely at Fanny , “ I should be sorry to have my powers of _ planning _ judged of by the day at Sotherton . 
Henry Crawford	gallant	He evidently tried to please her : he was gallant , he was attentive , he was something like what he had been to her cousins : he wanted , she supposed , to cheat her of her tranquillity as he had cheated them ; and whether he might not have some concern in this necklace — she could not be convinced that he had not , for Miss Crawford , complaisant as a sister , was careless as a woman and a friend . 
Henry Crawford	attentive	He evidently tried to please her : he was gallant , he was attentive , he was something like what he had been to her cousins : he wanted , she supposed , to cheat her of her tranquillity as he had cheated them ; and whether he might not have some concern in this necklace — she could not be convinced that he had not , for Miss Crawford , complaisant as a sister , was careless as a woman and a friend .

Henry Crawford	punctual	“ Yes , half - past nine , ” said Crawford to William as the latter was leaving them , “ and I shall be punctual , for there will be no kind sister to get up for _ me _ . ” 
Henry Crawford	punctual	Mr. Crawford had , as he foretold , been very punctual , and short and pleasant had been the meal . 
Henry Crawford	welcome	At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome ; he had only to consult his own judgment and feelings as to the frequency of his visits , at present or in future . 
Henry Crawford	man	He is a most extraordinary young man , and whatever be the event , 
Henry Crawford	precipitate	Crawford had been too precipitate . 
Henry Crawford	certain	I once saw Henry the Eighth acted , or I have heard of it from somebody who did , I am not certain which . 
Henry Crawford	afraid	Constancy : I am not afraid of the word . 
Henry Crawford	determined	Crawford , delighted to get her to speak at any rate , was determined to keep it up ; and poor Fanny , who had hoped to silence him by such an extremity of reproof , found herself sadly mistaken , and that it was only a change from one object of curiosity and one set of words to another . 
Henry Crawford	happier	“ Well , ” said Crawford , after a course of rapid questions and reluctant answers ; “ I am happier than I was , because I now understand more clearly your opinion of me . 
Henry Crawford	frightened	But still I am not frightened . 
Henry Crawford	attachment	Crawford ’s is no common attachment ; he perseveres , with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before . 
Henry Crawford	wrong	Maria was wrong , Crawford was wrong , we were all wrong together ; but none so wrong as myself 
Henry Crawford	flirt	He has now and then been a sad flirt , and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies ’ affections . 
Henry Crawford	warm	They talked of William , a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire ; and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart could wish . 
Henry Crawford	well	By the time he had given all this information , it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to ; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye , and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London ; that she had sent her best and kindest love , but had had no time for writing ; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour , having spent scarcely twenty - four hours in London , after his return from Norfolk , before he set off again ; that her cousin Edmund was in town , had been in town , he understood , a few days ; that he had not seen him himself , but that he was well , had left them all well at Mansfield , and was to dine , as yesterday , with the Frasers . 
Henry Crawford	ashamed	He must be ashamed and disgusted altogether . 
Henry Crawford	gentle	, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute ’s privacy for telling Fanny that his only business in Portsmouth was to see her ; that he was come down for a couple of days on her account , and hers only , and because he could not endure a longer total separation . She was sorry , really sorry ; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said , she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him ; he was much more gentle , obliging , and attentive to other people ’s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield ; she had never seen him so agreeable — so _ near _ being agreeable ; his behaviour to her father could not offend , and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of Susan . He was decidedly improved .

He was decidedly improved . 
Henry Crawford	open	They often stopt with the same sentiment and taste , leaning against the wall , some minutes , to look and admire ; and considering he was not Edmund , Fanny could not but allow that he was sufficiently open to the charms of nature , and very well able to express his admiration . 
Henry Crawford	gentle	Not considering in how different a circle she had been just seeing him , nor how much might be owing to contrast , she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and regardful of others than formerly . 
Henry Crawford	capable	As to Mr. Crawford , she hoped it might give him a knowledge of his own disposition , convince him that he was not capable of being steadily attached to any one woman in the world , and shame him from persisting any longer in addressing herself . 
Henry Crawford	flirt	He is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined . 
Henry Crawford	detestable	I assure you he is very detestable ; the Admiral ’s lessons have quite spoiled him . ” 
Henry Crawford	different	Henry is different ; he loves to be doing . 
Henry Crawford	improver	You have been an improver yourself , and from what I hear of Everingham , it may vie with any place in England . 
Henry Crawford	full	Nothing was fixed on ; but Henry Crawford was full of ideas and projects , and , generally speaking , whatever he proposed was immediately approved , first by her , and then by Mr. Rushworth , whose principal business seemed to be to hear the others , and who scarcely risked an original thought of his own beyond a wish that they had seen his friend Smith ’s place 
Henry Crawford	alive	Each sister could echo the wish ; and Henry Crawford , to whom , in all the riot of his gratifications it was yet an untasted pleasure , was quite alive at the idea . 
Henry Crawford	ready	Henry Crawford was ready to take either . 
Henry Crawford	sure	When you have studied the character , I am sure you will feel it suit you . 
Henry Crawford	sick	“ I must really congratulate your ladyship , ” said she , “ on the play being chosen ; for though you have borne it with exemplary patience , I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties . 
Henry Crawford	judge	She was not pleased to see Julia excluded from the play , and sitting by disregarded ; but as it was not a matter which really involved her happiness , as Henry must be the best judge of his own , and 
Henry Crawford	happy	I am grown too old to go out more than three times a week ; but I have a plan for the intermediate days , and what do you think it is ? ” “ To walk and ride with me , to be sure . ” “ Not exactly , though I shall be happy to do both , but _ that _ would be exercise only to my body , and I must take care of my mind . 
Henry Crawford	sure	Her eyes should be darker , but she has a sweet smile ; but as for this wonderful degree of improvement , I am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress , and your having nobody else to look at ; and therefore , if you do set about a flirtation with her , you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty , or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and 
Henry Crawford	improver	“ Mr. Bertram , ” said Miss Crawford , a few minutes afterwards , “ you know Henry to be such a capital improver , that you can not possibly engage in anything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help . 
Henry Crawford	useful	Only think how useful he was at Sotherton ! 
Henry Crawford	flattered	or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago , before he knew there was such a throat in the world ? 
Henry Crawford	unagreeable	But it was not to be avoided : he made her feel that she was the object of all ; though she could not say that it was unpleasantly done , that there was indelicacy or ostentation in his manner ; and sometimes , when he talked of William , he was really not unagreeable , and shewed even a warmth of heart which did him credit . 
Henry Crawford	determined	I am quite determined , Mary . 
Henry Crawford	determined	No : you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price . ” The surprise was now complete ; for , in spite of whatever his consciousness might suggest , a suspicion of his having any such views had never entered his sister ’s imagination ; and she looked so truly the astonishment she felt , that he was obliged to repeat what he had said , and more fully and more solemnly . 
Henry Crawford	accustomed	Henry Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of good principles in a wife , though he was too little accustomed to serious reflection to know them by their proper name ; but when he talked of her having such a steadiness and regularity of conduct , such a high notion of honour , and such an observance of decorum as might warrant any man in the fullest dependence on her faith and integrity , he expressed what was inspired by the knowledge of her being well principled and religious . “ I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her , ” said he ; “ and _ that _ is what I want . ” 
Henry Crawford	sensible	_ You _ are not sensible of the gain , for your regard for him has blinded you ; but , in my estimation , your marrying early may be the saving of you . 
Henry Crawford	happy	Henry was most happy to make it more intelligible , by beginning at an earlier stage , and explaining very particularly what he had done . 
Henry Crawford	incomprehensible	He was inexcusable , incomprehensible ! 
Henry Crawford	serious	She would not have him be serious , and yet what could excuse the use of such words and offers , if they meant but to trifle ? 
Henry Crawford	hero	For as to secrecy , Henry is quite the hero of an old romance , and glories in his chains . 
Henry Crawford	happier	“ I can not imagine Henry ever to have been happier , ” continued Mary presently , “ than when he had succeeded in getting your brother ’s commission . ” 
Henry Crawford	wild	At this very moment he is wild to see you , and occupied only in contriving the means for doing so , and for making his pleasure conduce to yours . 
Henry Crawford	blameless	Depend upon it , there is some mistake , and that a day or two will clear it up ; at any rate , that Henry is blameless , and in spite of a moment ’s _ etourderie _ , thinks of nobody but you . 
Henry Crawford	happy	Had she accepted him as she ought , they might now have been on the point of marriage , and Henry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object . 
Henry Crawford	busy	Had she accepted him as she ought , they might now have been on the point of marriage , and Henry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other object . 
Henry Crawford	satisfied	Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one amiable woman ’s affections , could he have found sufficient exultation in overcoming the reluctance , in working himself into the esteem and tenderness of Fanny Price , there would have been every probability of success and felicity for him . 
Henry Crawford	glad	When he returned from Richmond , he would have been glad to see Mrs. Rushworth no more . 
Mrs. Norris	sure	“ My dear Sir Thomas , I perfectly comprehend you , and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions , which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct ; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one ’s own hands ; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion . 
Mrs. Norris	person	“ My dear Sir Thomas , I perfectly comprehend you , and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions , which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct ; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one ’s own hands ; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion . 
Mrs. Norris	sure	I am sure Mr. Norris is too just — but you know I am a woman of few words and professions . 
Mrs. Norris	woman	I am sure Mr. Norris is too just — but you know I am a woman of few words and professions . 
Mrs. Norris	sure	I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in , and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price , and creditable to ourselves , we must secure to the child , or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter , as circumstances may arise , the provision of a gentlewoman , if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting . ” “ I thoroughly understand you , ” cried Mrs. Norris , “ you are everything that is generous and considerate , and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point . 
Mrs. Norris	ready	Whatever I can do , as you well know , I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love ; and , though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children , nor consider her , in any respect , so much my own , I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her . 
Mrs. Norris	capable	Whatever I can do , as you well know , I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love ; and , though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children , nor consider her , in any respect , so much my own , I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her . 
Mrs. Norris	sorry	Mrs. Norris was sorry to say that the little girl ’s staying with them , at least as things then were , was quite out of the question . 
Mrs. Norris	sure	just now , poor Mr. Norris took up every moment of her time , and the very mention of such a thing she was sure would distract him . 
Mrs. Norris	useful	only wish I could be more useful ; but you see I do all in my power . 
Mrs. Norris	woman	She was a woman who spent her days in sitting , nicely dressed , on a sofa , doing some long piece of needlework , of little use and no beauty , thinking more of her pug than her children , but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put herself to inconvenience , guided in everything important by Sir Thomas , and in smaller concerns by her sister . 
Mrs. Norris	sure	, I am sure , would 
Mrs. Norris	sure	I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it . ” 
Mrs. Norris	ashamed	I _ have _ _ been _ a liberal housekeeper enough , but I shall not be ashamed to practise economy now . 
Mrs. Norris	miserable	I _ must _ live within my income , or I shall be miserable ; and I own it would give me great satisfaction 
Mrs. Norris	glad	I have nobody else to care for , but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little trifle among them worth their having . ” 
Mrs. Norris	good	“ You are very good , but do not trouble yourself about them . 
Mrs. Norris	zealous	Mrs. Norris was most zealous in promoting the match , by every suggestion and contrivance likely to enhance its desirableness to either party ; and , among other means , by seeking an intimacy with the gentleman ’s mother , who at present lived with him , and to whom she even forced Lady Bertram to go through ten miles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit . 
Mrs. Norris	friends	Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris were seldom good friends ; their acquaintance had begun in dilapidations , and their habits were totally dissimilar . 
Mrs. Norris	sure	I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out . 
Mrs. Norris	afraid	“ Yes , and I am afraid they will be the last this year . 
Mrs. Norris	sure	“ I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better , ” cried Mrs. Norris , unable to be longer deaf ; “ unless I had gone myself , indeed ; but I can not be in two places at once ; and I was talking to Mr. Green at that very time about your mother ’s dairymaid , by _ her _ desire , and had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son , and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour . 
Mrs. Norris	unreasonable	And as for Fanny ’s just stepping down to my house for me — it is not much above a quarter of a mile — I can not think I was unreasonable to ask it . 
Mrs. Norris	pleased	Mrs. Norris and her nieces were all well pleased with its revival , and an early day was named and agreed to , provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged : the young ladies 
Mrs. Norris	ready	Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could remain — their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could not go , and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in taking her , which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got over . 
Mrs. Norris	delight	Miss Crawford was not slow to admire ; she pretty well guessed Miss Bertram ’s feelings , and made it a point of honour to promote her enjoyment to the utmost . Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility ; and even Fanny had something to say in admiration , and might be heard with complacency . Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach ; and after being at some pains to get a view of the house , and observing that “ it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect , ” she added , “ Now , where is the avenue ?

Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach ; and after being at some pains to get a view of the house , and observing that “ it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect , ” she added , “ Now , where is the avenue ? 
Mrs. Norris	sure	I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go . 
Mrs. Norris	delighted	as the whole arrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody , and none at all to herself , as she foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry , bustle , and importance , and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself obliged to leave her own house , where she had been living a month at her own cost , and take up her abode in theirs , that every hour might be spent in their service , she was , in fact , exceedingly delighted with the project . CHAPTER XIV Fanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed . 
Mrs. Norris	sure	“ If every play is to be objected to , you will act nothing , and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away , and I am sure _ that _ would be a discredit to us all . 
Mrs. Norris	ashamed	Her entreaty had no effect on Tom : he only said again what he had said before ; and it was not merely Tom , for the requisition was now backed by Maria , and Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Yates , with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious , and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny ; and before she could breathe after it , Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you ! 
Mrs. Norris	busy	Edmund , between his theatrical and his real part , between Miss Crawford ’s claims and his own conduct , between love and consistency , was equally unobservant ; and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company , superintending their various dresses with economical expedient , for which nobody thanked her , and saving , with delighted integrity , half a crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas , to have leisure for watching the behaviour , or guarding the happiness of his daughters . 
Mrs. Norris	mistaken	“ You had better stay till the curtain is hung , ” interposed Mrs. Norris ; “ the curtain will be hung in a day or two — there is very little sense in a play without a curtain — and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons . ” 
Mrs. Norris	confounded	Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as nearly being silenced as ever she had been in her life ; for she was ashamed to confess having never seen any of the impropriety which was so glaring to Sir Thomas , and would not have admitted that her influence was insufficient — that she might have talked in vain . 
Mrs. Norris	impregnable	_ There _ she was impregnable . 
Mrs. Norris	active	“ If I had not been active , ” said she , “ and made a point of being introduced to his mother , and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit , I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come of it ; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement , and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle . 
Mrs. Norris	certain	“ If I had not been active , ” said she , “ and made a point of being introduced to his mother , and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit , I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come of it ; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement , and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle . 
Mrs. Norris	ready	I was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister , and at last I did persuade her . 
Mrs. Norris	sure	this was such a day , I could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture : he was putting on his wig ; so I said , ‘ Coachman , you had much better not go ; your Lady and I shall be very safe ; you know how steady Stephen is , and Charles has been upon the leaders so often now , that I am sure there is no fear . 
Mrs. Norris	pleased	Mr. Rushworth ’s manners , but I was pleased last night with what appeared to be his opinion on one subject : his decided preference of a quiet family party to the bustle and confusion of acting . 
Mrs. Norris	remiss	Mrs. Norris began to look about her , and wonder that his falling in love with Julia had come to nothing ; and could almost fear that she had been remiss herself in forwarding it ; but with so many to care for , how was it possible for even _ her _ activity to keep pace with her wishes ? 
Mrs. Norris	sure	William , you are quite out of luck ; but the next time you come , I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at home , and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly 
Mrs. Norris	happy	“ I should be very happy , aunt ; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head ; and if I could get so far , I could not expect to be welcome in such a smart place as that — poor scrubby midshipman as I am . ” 
Mrs. Norris	ready	Mrs. Norris was ready with her suggestions as to the rooms he would think fittest to be used , but found it all prearranged ; and when she would have conjectured and hinted about the day , it appeared that the day was settled too . 
Mrs. Norris	an	Your aunt Norris has always been an advocate , and very judiciously , for young people ’s being brought up without unnecessary indulgences ; but there should be moderation in everything . 
Mrs. Norris	sure	You mean me , Baddeley , I am sure ; Sir Thomas wants me , not Miss Price . ” 
Mrs. Norris	angry	Angry she was : bitterly angry ; but she was more angry with Fanny for having received such an offer than for refusing it . 
Mrs. Norris	necessary	that she could not possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present ; that she was a great deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram for her to be able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a week , and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to that of being useful to them . 
Mrs. Norris	able	that she could not possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present ; that she was a great deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram for her to be able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a week , and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to that of being useful to them . 
Mrs. Norris	sufferer	Mrs. Norris , however , as most attached to Maria , was really the greatest sufferer . 
Mrs. Norris	an	Your aunt Norris has always been an advocate , and very judiciously , for young people ’s being brought up without unnecessary indulgences ; but there should be moderation in everything . 
Mrs. Norris	hardy	She is also very hardy herself , which of course will influence her in her opinion of the wants of others . 
Maria Bertram	pride	Maria was indeed the pride and delight of them all — perfectly faultless — an angel ; and , of course , so surrounded by admirers , must be difficult in her choice : but yet , as far as Mrs. Norris could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance , Mr. Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve and attach her . 
Maria Bertram	kind	it was a pity she should not see the place . ” “ You are very kind , you are all kindness , my dear madam , ” cried Mrs. Norris ; “ but as to Fanny , she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton . 
Maria Bertram	kindness	it was a pity she should not see the place . ” “ You are very kind , you are all kindness , my dear madam , ” cried Mrs. Norris ; “ but as to Fanny , she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton . 
Maria Bertram	ready	How unlucky that you are not ordained ; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready . ” 
Maria Bertram	discontented	Maria was just discontented enough to say directly , “ I think _ you _ have done pretty well yourself , ma’am . 
Maria Bertram	more	Maria was more to be pitied than Julia ; for to her the father brought a husband , and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness would unite her to the lover , on whom she had chosen that happiness should depend . 
Maria Bertram	vexed	She looked suspiciously at her sister ; Maria ’s countenance was to decide it : if she were vexed and alarmed — but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction , and Julia well knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her expense . 
Maria Bertram	alarmed	She looked suspiciously at her sister ; Maria ’s countenance was to decide it : if she were vexed and alarmed — but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction , and Julia well knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her expense . 
Maria Bertram	happy	She looked suspiciously at her sister ; Maria ’s countenance was to decide it : if she were vexed and alarmed — but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction , and Julia well knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her expense . 
Maria Bertram	woman	“ I am perfectly acquainted with the play , I assure you ; and with a very few omissions , and so forth , which will be made , of course , I can see nothing objectionable in it ; and _ I _ am not the _ only _ young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation . ” 
Maria Bertram	sure	In all points of decorum _ your _ conduct must be law to the rest of the party . ” This picture of her consequence had some effect , for no one loved better to lead than Maria ; and with far more good - humour she answered , “ I am much obliged to you , Edmund ; you mean very well , I am sure : but I still think you see things too strongly ; and I really can not undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind . 
Maria Bertram	capable	Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time ; and if she were applied to again among themselves with all the authoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of , and Edmund perhaps away , what should she do ? 
Maria Bertram	good	I am sure _ Julia _ does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends 
Maria Bertram	sure	Fanny , I am sure you know the part . ” 
Maria Bertram	disturbed	It was of the utmost consequence to her that Crawford should now lose no time in declaring himself , and she was disturbed that even a day should be gone by without seeming to advance that point . 
Maria Bertram	able	Maria had a moment ’s struggle as she listened , and only a moment ’s : when her father ceased , she was able to give her answer immediately , decidedly , and with no apparent agitation . 
Maria Bertram	safe	She was in a state of mind to be glad that she had secured her fate beyond recall : that she had pledged herself anew to Sotherton ; that she was safe from the possibility of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her actions , and destroying her prospects ; and retired in proud resolve , determined only to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth in future , that her father might not be again suspecting her . 
Maria Bertram	complete	In all the important preparations of the mind she was complete : being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home , restraint , and tranquillity ; by the misery of disappointed affection , and contempt of the man she was to marry . 
Maria Bertram	ready	Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire , and make way for the fortunate young woman whom her dear son had selected ; and very early in November removed herself , her maid , her footman , and her chariot , with true dowager propriety , to Bath , there to parade over the wonders of Sotherton in her evening parties ; enjoying them as thoroughly , perhaps , in the animation of a card - table , as she had ever done on the spot ; and before the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which gave Sotherton another mistress . 
Maria Bertram	good	Well , I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two - and - forty speeches to her ” ; adding , with a momentary seriousness , “ She is too good for him — much too good . ” 
Maria Bertram	glad	Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her . 
Maria Bertram	angry	They will be angry , ” he added , after a moment ’s silence , and in a cooler tone ; “ Mrs. Rushworth will be very angry . 
Maria Bertram	wrong	Maria was wrong , Crawford was wrong , we were all wrong together ; but none so wrong as myself 
Maria Bertram	capable	I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of it ; but , if she could undertake the part , we must not be surprised at the rest . 
Maria Bertram	favourite	Maria was her first favourite , the dearest of all ; the match had been her own contriving , as she had been wo nt with such pride of heart to feel and say , and this conclusion of it almost overpowered her . She was an altered creature , quieted , stupefied , indifferent to everything that passed . 
Maria Bertram	creature	Maria was her first favourite , the dearest of all ; the match had been her own contriving , as she had been wo nt with such pride of heart to feel and say , and this conclusion of it almost overpowered her . She was an altered creature , quieted , stupefied , indifferent to everything that passed . 
Maria Bertram	unable	; she had been unable to direct or dictate , or even fancy herself useful . 
Maria Bertram	unmanageable	However that might be , she was unmanageable . 
Maria Bertram	less	But had she been less obstinate , or of less weight with her son , who was always guided by the last speaker , by the person who could get hold of and shut him up , the case would still have been hopeless , for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear again , and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealed somewhere with Mr. Crawford , who had quitted his uncle ’s house , as for a journey , on the very day of her absenting herself . 
Maria Bertram	able	She had never been able to attach even those she loved best ; and since Mrs. Rushworth ’s elopement , her temper had been in a state of such irritation as to make her everywhere tormenting . 
Julia Bertram	aware	Miss Bertram ’s engagement made him in equity the property of Julia , of which Julia was fully aware ; and before he had been at Mansfield a week , she was quite ready to be fallen in love with . 
Julia Bertram	handsomest	She has the advantage in every feature , and I prefer her countenance ; but I like Julia best ; Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest , and I have found her the most agreeable , but I shall always like Julia best , because you order me . ” 
Julia Bertram	engaged	“ And besides , Miss Bertram is engaged . 
Julia Bertram	satisfied	She is satisfied with herself . 
Julia Bertram	sure	Its natural beauties , I am sure , are great . 
Julia Bertram	sure	“ I was sure she would ride well , ” said Julia ; “ she has the make for it . Her figure is as neat as her brother ’s . ” “ Yes , ” added Maria , “ and her spirits are as good , and she has the same energy of character . 
Julia Bertram	sure	“ It seems very odd , ” said Maria , “ that you should be staying at home instead of Fanny . ” “ I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you , ” added Julia , hastily leaving the room as she spoke , from a consciousness that she ought to offer to stay at home herself . 
Julia Bertram	glad	I was glad to see you so well entertained . 
Julia Bertram	lively	I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish anecdotes during a ten miles ’ drive . ” “ Naturally , I believe , I am as lively as Julia , but I have more to think of now . ” 
Julia Bertram	bosom	She felt , as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth , that hers was not the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them : there was gloom on the face of each . 
Julia Bertram	choice	” Fanny supposed she must have been mistaken , and meant to think differently in future ; but with all that submission to Edmund could do , and all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she occasionally noticed in some of the others , and which seemed to say that Julia was Mr. Crawford ’s choice , she knew not always what to think . 
Julia Bertram	happy	Four thousand a year is a pretty estate , and he seems a very genteel , steady young man , so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy . ” “ It is not a settled thing , ma’am , yet . 
Julia Bertram	certain	She was acknowledged to be quite right , and the two parts being accepted accordingly , she was certain of the proper Frederick . 
Julia Bertram	tall	She is too tall and robust . 
Julia Bertram	sure	“ Do not be afraid of _ my _ wanting the character , ” cried Julia , with angry quickness : “ I am _ not _ to be Agatha , and I am sure I will do nothing else ; and as to Amelia , it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me . 
Julia Bertram	sure	A short silence succeeded her leaving them ; but her brother soon returned to business and Lovers ’ Vows , and was eagerly looking over the play , with Mr. Yates ’s help , to ascertain what scenery would be necessary — while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an under - voice , and the declaration with which she began of , “ I am sure I would give up the part to Julia most willingly , but that though I shall probably do it very ill , I feel persuaded _ she _ would do it worse , ” was doubtless receiving all the compliments it called for . 
Julia Bertram	scrupulous	she might think the difference between us — the difference in our situations — that _ she _ need not be so scrupulous as _ I _ might feel necessary . 
Julia Bertram	sufferer	Julia was a sufferer too , though not quite so blamelessly . 
Julia Bertram	superior	The sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become her greatest enemy : they were alienated from each other ; and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the attentions which were still carrying on there , some punishment to Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr. Rushworth . 
Julia Bertram	first	Julia was the first to move and speak again . 
Julia Bertram	cool	His presence was beginning to be odious to her ; and if Maria gained him not , she was now cool enough to dispense with any other revenge . 
Julia Bertram	eager	Some other companion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first consequence to his lady ; and Julia was quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as Maria , though she might not have struggled through so much to obtain them , and could better bear a subordinate situation . 
Julia Bertram	able	If Mrs. Rushworth could imagine any interfering obligations , Julia was certainly able to quit London whenever she chose . 
Julia Bertram	amazed	Julia ’s elopement could affect her comparatively but little ; she was amazed and shocked ; but it could not occupy her , could not dwell on her mind . 
Julia Bertram	humble	She was humble , and wishing to be forgiven ; and Mr. Yates , desirous of being really received into the family , was disposed to look up to him and be guided . 
Julia Bertram	darling	That Julia escaped better than Maria was owing , in some measure , to a favourable difference of disposition and circumstance , but in a greater to her having been less the darling of that very aunt , less flattered and less spoilt . 
Julia Bertram	flattered	That Julia escaped better than Maria was owing , in some measure , to a favourable difference of disposition and circumstance , but in a greater to her having been less the darling of that very aunt , less flattered and less spoilt . 
William Price	true	Without any display of doing more than the rest , or any fear of doing too much , he was always true to her interests , and considerate of her feelings , trying to make her good qualities understood , and to conquer the diffidence which prevented their being more apparent ; giving her advice , consolation , and encouragement . 
William Price	equal	that he could relate of his own horsemanship in various countries , of the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged , the rough horses and mules he had ridden , or his many narrow escapes from dreadful falls , that he was at all equal to the management of a high - fed hunter in an English fox - chase ; nor till he returned safe and well , without accident or discredit , could she be reconciled to the risk , or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the horse which he had fully intended it should produce . 
William Price	fond	“ Are you fond of dancing , Fanny ? ” “ Yes , very ; only I am soon tired . ” “ I should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance . 
William Price	man	“ She could not recollect what it was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes , or what it was that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny : she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finest young man in the room — somebody had whispered something to her 
William Price	lieutenant	But William was a lieutenant . 
William Price	able	“ _ Now _ William would be able to keep himself , which would make a vast difference to his uncle , for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle ; and , indeed , it would make some difference in _ her _ presents too . 
William Price	master	William ’s promotion , with all its particulars , he was soon master of ; and with such a secret provision of comfort within his own breast to help the joy , he found in it a source of most gratifying sensation and unvarying cheerfulness all dinner - time . 
William Price	alone	After dinner , when he and his father were alone , he had Fanny ’s history ; and then all the great events of the last fortnight , and the present situation of matters at Mansfield were known to him . 
William Price	earnest	while honouring her for what she had done under the influence of her present indifference , honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas could quite echo , he was most earnest in hoping , and sanguine in believing , that it would be a match at last , and that , united by mutual affection , it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly fitted to make them blessed in each other , as he was now beginning seriously to consider them . 
William Price	sanguine	while honouring her for what she had done under the influence of her present indifference , honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas could quite echo , he was most earnest in hoping , and sanguine in believing , that it would be a match at last , and that , united by mutual affection , it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly fitted to make them blessed in each other , as he was now beginning seriously to consider them . 
William Price	creature	What a happy creature William must be ! 
William Price	delighted	He came ; and he would have been delighted to shew his uniform there too , had not cruel custom prohibited its appearance except on duty . 
William Price	happy	William was almost as happy in the plan as his sister . 
William Price	sure	You will set things going in a better way , I am sure . 
William Price	struck	she could not help thinking her poor dear sister Price would feel it very unkind of her not to come by such an opportunity . William and Fanny were horror - struck at the idea . 
William Price	full	Everything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William ’s mind , and he was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their higher - toned subjects , all of which ended , if they did not begin , in praise of the Thrush , conjectures how she would be employed , schemes for an action with some superior force , which ( supposing the first lieutenant out of the way , and William was not very merciful to the first lieutenant ) was to give himself the next step as soon as possible , or speculations upon prize - money , which was to be generously distributed at home , with only the reservation of enough to make the little cottage comfortable , in which he and Fanny were to pass all their middle and later life together . Fanny ’s immediate concerns , as far as they involved Mr. Crawford , made 
William Price	merciful	Everything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William ’s mind , and he was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their higher - toned subjects , all of which ended , if they did not begin , in praise of the Thrush , conjectures how she would be employed , schemes for an action with some superior force , which ( supposing the first lieutenant out of the way , and William was not very merciful to the first lieutenant ) was to give himself the next step as soon as possible , or speculations upon prize - money , which was to be generously distributed at home , with only the reservation of enough to make the little cottage comfortable , in which he and Fanny were to pass all their middle and later life together .

William Price	pride	William was her pride ; Betsey her darling ; and 
William Price	able	He was able to introduce some improvement occasionally , though by no means to the extent he wished ; he absolutely would not walk away from them ; and at any crossing or any crowd , when Mr. Price was only calling out , “ Come , girls ; come , Fan ; come , Sue , take care of yourselves ; keep a sharp lookout ! ” he would give them his particular attendance . 
Lady Bertram	able	“ Well , Lady Bertram , ” said Mrs. Norris , moving to go , “ I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ; 
Lady Bertram	safe	Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to convince him how much he had mistaken his sister - in - law ’s views ; and she was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation , or the slightest allusion to it from him . 
Lady Bertram	forward	He could not but wonder at her refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt ; but , as she took early care to make him , as well as Lady Bertram , understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family , he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which , at the same time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them , would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself . Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal ; and her spontaneous , untaught felicity on the discovery , conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her . 
Lady Bertram	astonished	I was quite astonished . 
Lady Bertram	asleep	Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing - room , fresh with the evening air , glowing and cheerful , the very reverse of what they found in the three ladies sitting there , for Maria would scarcely raise her eyes from her book , and Lady Bertram was half - asleep ; and even Mrs. Norris , discomposed by her niece ’s ill - humour , and having asked one or two questions about the dinner , which were not immediately attended to , seemed almost determined to say no more . 
Lady Bertram	afraid	“ I was afraid it would be too much for her , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ but when the roses were gathered , your aunt wished to have them , and then you know they must be taken home 
Lady Bertram	afraid	Between ourselves , Edmund , ” nodding significantly at his mother , “ it was cutting the roses , and dawdling about in the flower - garden , that did the mischief . ” “ I am afraid it was , indeed , ” said the more candid Lady Bertram , 
Lady Bertram	afraid	; “ I am very much afraid she caught the headache there , for the heat was enough to kill anybody . 
Lady Bertram	happy	“ The loss of her ladyship ’s company would be a great drawback , and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too , Miss Price , who had never been at Sotherton yet , 
Lady Bertram	pleased	Lady Bertram was very well pleased to have it so , and the young ladies were in spirits again . 
Lady Bertram	sure	I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys . 
Lady Bertram	sure	And I am sure , _ my _ _ name _ _ was _ _ Norval _ , every evening of my life through one Christmas holidays . ” “ It was a very different thing . 
Lady Bertram	sure	“ I must really congratulate your ladyship , ” said she , “ on the play being chosen ; for though you have borne it with exemplary patience , I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties . 
Lady Bertram	sure	I can not spare her , and I am sure she does not want to go . 
Lady Bertram	indolent	His readiness , however , in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage , when the general invitation was at last hazarded , after many debates and many doubts as to whether it were worth while , “ because Sir Thomas seemed so ill inclined , and Lady Bertram was so indolent ! ” 
Lady Bertram	quiescent	Lady Bertram was perfectly quiescent and contented , and had no objections to make . 
Lady Bertram	contented	Lady Bertram was perfectly quiescent and contented , and had no objections to make . 
Lady Bertram	afraid	Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very little trouble ; and she assured him “ that she was not at all afraid of the trouble ; indeed , she could not imagine there would be any . ” 
Lady Bertram	certain	Lady Bertram was not certain of anybody ’s dress or anybody ’s place at supper but her own . 
Lady Bertram	sure	“ She could not recollect what it was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes , or what it was that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny : she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finest young man in the room — somebody had whispered something to her 
Lady Bertram	glad	Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm “ Yes ” ; and at the end of a quarter of an hour ’s silent consideration spontaneously observed , “ Sir Thomas , I have been thinking — and I am very glad we took Fanny 
Lady Bertram	glad	” “ I am glad you gave him something considerable , ” said Lady Bertram , with most unsuspicious calmness , “ for _ I _ gave him only £ 10 . ” 
Lady Bertram	beauty	She had been a beauty , and a prosperous beauty , all her life ; and beauty and wealth were all that excited her respect . 
Lady Bertram	sure	“ I will tell you what , Fanny , ” said she , “ I am sure he fell in love with you at the ball ; I am sure the mischief was done that evening . 
Lady Bertram	sure	“ I will tell you what , Fanny , ” said she , “ I am sure he fell in love with you at the ball ; I am sure the mischief was done that evening . 
Lady Bertram	glad	I am very glad I sent Chapman to you . 
Lady Bertram	sure	I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that evening . ” 
Lady Bertram	sure	“ That may be , sister , ” was all Lady Bertram ’s reply . “ I dare say you are very right ; but I am sure I shall miss her very much . ” 
Lady Bertram	subject	CHAPTER XLV At about the week ’s end from his return to Mansfield , Tom ’s immediate danger was over , and he was so far pronounced safe as to make his mother perfectly easy ; for being now used to the sight of him in his suffering , helpless state , and hearing only the best , and never thinking beyond what she heard , with no disposition for alarm and no aptitude at a hint , Lady Bertram was the happiest subject in the world for a little medical imposition . 
Lady Bertram	comfortable	Fanny had scarcely passed the solemn - looking servants , when Lady Bertram came from the drawing - room to meet her ; came with no indolent step ; and falling on her neck , said , “ Dear Fanny ! now I shall be comfortable . ” 
Lady Bertram	asleep	“ What is the matter ? ” asked her ladyship , in the heavy tone of one half - roused ; “ I was not asleep . ” 
Lady Bertram	sure	“ You have a great turn for acting , I am sure , Mr. Crawford , ” said her ladyship soon afterwards ; “ and I will tell you what 
Lady Bertram	happy	Instead of being soon well enough to follow his friends , as he had then hoped , his disorder increased considerably , and it was not long before he thought so ill of himself as to be as ready as his physician to have a letter despatched to Mansfield . “ This distressing intelligence , as you may suppose , ” observed her ladyship , after giving the substance of it , “ has agitated us exceedingly , and we can not prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive for the poor invalid , whose state Sir Thomas fears may be very critical ; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother immediately , but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on this distressing occasion , as it would be too trying for me . 
Mr. Rushworth	sort	“ Why , as to that , Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man , and it is a great match for her . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	eager	Mr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his acquiescence , and tried to make out something complimentary ; but , between his submission to _ her _ taste , and his having always intended the same himself , with the superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies in general , and of insinuating that there was one only whom he was anxious to please , he grew puzzled , and Edmund was glad to put an end to his speech by a proposal of wine . 
Mr. Rushworth	anxious	Mr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his acquiescence , and tried to make out something complimentary ; but , between his submission to _ her _ taste , and his having always intended the same himself , with the superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies in general , and of insinuating that there was one only whom he was anxious to please , he grew puzzled , and Edmund was glad to put an end to his speech by a proposal of wine . 
Mr. Rushworth	right	Mr. Rushworth is quite right , I think , in meaning to give it a modern dress , and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	ready	How unlucky that you are not ordained ; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	determined	Mr. Rushworth wished he had brought the key ; he had been very near thinking whether he should not bring the key ; he was determined he would never come without the key again ; but still this did not remove the present evil . 
Mr. Rushworth	a	After a moment ’s embarrassment the lady replied , “ You are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world . 
Mr. Rushworth	displeased	He joined her within five minutes after Julia ’s exit ; and though she made the best of the story , he was evidently mortified and displeased in no common degree . 
Mr. Rushworth	remiss	Mr. Rushworth is never remiss . 
Mr. Rushworth	silent	Mr. Rushworth could be silent no longer . 
Mr. Rushworth	fond	I am not so fond of acting as I was at first . 
Mr. Rushworth	sort	“ If I had not been active , ” said she , “ and made a point of being introduced to his mother , and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit , I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come of it ; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement , and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle . 
Mr. Rushworth	character	He is not a shining character , but he has a thousand good qualities ; and is so disposed to look up to you , that I am quite laughed at about it , for everybody considers it as my doing . 
Mr. Rushworth	man	Not all his good - will for Mr. Rushworth , not all Mr. Rushworth ’s deference for him , could prevent him from soon discerning some part of the truth — that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man , as ignorant in business as in books , with opinions in general unfixed , and without seeming much aware of it himself . 
Mr. Rushworth	young	Mr. Rushworth was young enough to improve . 
Mr. Rushworth	impatient	To such feelings delay , even the delay of much preparation , would have been an evil , and Mr. Rushworth could hardly be more impatient for the marriage than herself . 
Mr. Rushworth	man	Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations , and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man . 
Mr. Rushworth	jealous	” “ As a bystander , ” said Fanny , “ perhaps I saw more than you did ; and I do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous . ” 
Mrs. Grant	indebted	delighted in the boy , Mrs. Crawford doted on the girl ; and it was the lady ’s death which now obliged her _ protegee _ , after some months ’ further trial at her uncle ’s house , to find another home . Admiral Crawford was a man of vicious conduct , who chose , instead of retaining his niece , to bring his mistress under his own roof ; and to this Mrs. Grant was indebted for her sister ’s proposal of coming to her , a measure quite as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the other ; for Mrs. Grant , having by this time run through the usual resources of ladies residing in the country without a family of children — having more than filled her favourite sitting - room with pretty furniture , and made a choice collection of plants and poultry — was very much in want of some variety at home . 
Mrs. Grant	delighted	She was delighted with each , but Mary was her dearest object ; and having never been able to glory in beauty of her own 
Mrs. Grant	ashamed	I am not at all ashamed of it . 
Mrs. Grant	glad	Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next , under the conviction that everybody must be wanting to see Sotherton , to include Miss Crawford in the invitation ; and though Mrs. Grant , who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs. Rushworth , on her coming into the neighbourhood , civilly declined it on her own account , she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister ; and Mary , properly pressed and persuaded , was not long in accepting her share of the civility . 
Mrs. Grant	easy	But reflection brought better feelings , and shewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect , which could never have belonged to _ her _ ; and that , had she received even the greatest , she could never have been easy in joining a scheme which , considering only her uncle , she must condemn altogether . 
Mrs. Grant	sure	I am sure _ Julia _ does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends 
Mrs. Grant	capable	Her heart was sore and angry , and she was capable only of angry consolations . 
Mrs. Grant	necessary	Her pleasant manners and cheerful conformity made her always valuable amongst them ; but _ now _ she was absolutely necessary . 
Mrs. Grant	glad	I am so glad your eldest cousin is gone , that he may be Mr. Bertram again . 
Mrs. Grant	able	Twice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of his lady , but in vain ; no pause was long enough for the time his measured manner needed ; and very little of her state could be known till Mrs. Grant was able , at the end of the first rubber , to go to her and pay her compliments . “ I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game . ” 
Susan Price	unreasonable	it was not such a home , she had not such a welcome , as — she checked herself ; she was unreasonable . 
Susan Price	cross	“ Now , Susan , ” cried Mrs. Price , in a complaining voice , “ now , how can you be so cross ? 
Susan Price	quarrelsome	I wish you would not be so quarrelsome . 
Susan Price	cross	Poor little Betsey ; how cross Susan is to you ! 
Susan Price	useful	Susan tried to be useful , where _ she _ could only have gone away and cried ; and that Susan was useful she could perceive ; that things , bad as they were , would have been worse but for such interposition , and that both her mother and Betsey were restrained from some excesses of very offensive indulgence and vulgarity . In every argument with her mother , Susan had in point of reason the advantage , and never was there any maternal tenderness to buy her off . 
Susan Price	unused	But she was so wholly unused to confer favours , except on the very poor , so unpractised in removing evils , or bestowing kindnesses among her equals , and so fearful of appearing to elevate herself as a great lady at home , that it took some time to determine that it would not be unbecoming in her to make such a present . 
Susan Price	eager	Susan , who had an innate taste for the genteel and well - appointed , was eager to hear , and Fanny could not but indulge herself in dwelling on so beloved a theme . 
Susan Price	companion	Without any particular affection for her eldest cousin , her tenderness of heart made her feel that she could not spare him , and the purity of her principles added yet a keener solicitude , when she considered how little useful , how little self - denying his life had ( apparently ) been . Susan was her only companion and listener on this , as on more common occasions . 
Susan Price	listener	Without any particular affection for her eldest cousin , her tenderness of heart made her feel that she could not spare him , and the purity of her principles added yet a keener solicitude , when she considered how little useful , how little self - denying his life had ( apparently ) been . Susan was her only companion and listener on this , as on more common occasions . 
Susan Price	ready	Susan was always ready to hear and to sympathise . 
Susan Price	grievance	Susan too was a grievance . 
Susan Price	more	Lady Bertram could not give her much time , or many words , but she felt her , as Fanny ’s sister , to have a claim at Mansfield , and was ready to kiss and like her ; and Susan was more than satisfied , for she came perfectly aware that nothing but ill - humour was to be expected from aunt Norris ; and was so provided with happiness , so strong in that best of blessings , an escape from many certain evils , that she could have stood against a great deal more indifference than she met with from the others . She was now left a good deal to herself , to get acquainted with the house and grounds as she could , and spent her days very happily in so doing , while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut up , or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them , at this time , for everything like comfort ; Edmund trying to bury his own feelings in exertions for the relief of his brother ’s , and Fanny 
Mr. Yates	sorry	I was sorry for _ him _ that he should have so mistaken his powers , for he was no more equal to the Baron — a little man with a weak voice , always hoarse after the first ten minutes . 
Mr. Yates	surprised	I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick . 
Mr. Yates	tallest	Miss Bertram , feeling all the interest of an Agatha in the question , took on her to decide it , by observing to Mr. Yates that this was a point in which height and figure ought to be considered , and that _ his _ being the tallest , seemed to fit him peculiarly for the Baron . 
Mr. Yates	alone	Fanny told of their departure , and delivered their message . “ Then poor Yates is all alone , ” cried Tom . 
Mr. Yates	afraid	Our company is now so dispersed , from the Crawfords being gone home , that nothing more can be done to - night ; but if you will give us the honour of your company to - morrow evening , I should not be afraid of the result . 
Mr. Yates	man	He was not a man to be endured but for his children ’s sake , and he might be thankful to his fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates did yet mean to stay a few days longer under his roof . 
Mr. Yates	thankful	He was not a man to be endured but for his children ’s sake , and he might be thankful to his fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates did yet mean to stay a few days longer under his roof . 
Mrs. Price	better	She spoke of her farther as somewhat delicate and puny , but was sanguine in the hope of her being materially better for change of air . 
Mrs. Price	afraid	And now I am afraid Campbell will be here before there is time to dress a steak , and we have no butcher at hand . 
Mrs. Price	sure	“ Her year ! ” cried Mrs. Price ; “ I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her before she has staid a year , for that will not be up till November . 
Mrs. Price	difficult	And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress to please ; and I am sure the place is easy enough , 
Mrs. Price	sure	And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress to please ; and I am sure the place is easy enough , 
Mrs. Price	dead	she could but just speak to be heard , and she said so prettily , ‘ Let sister Susan have my knife , mama , when I am dead and buried . 
Mrs. Price	unkind	Mrs. Price was not unkind ; but , instead of gaining on her affection and confidence , and becoming more and more dear , her daughter never met with greater kindness from her than on the first day of her arrival . 
Mrs. Price	fond	She was fond of her sons , especially of William , but Betsey was the 
Mrs. Price	manager	She was a manager by necessity , without any of Mrs. Norris ’s inclination for it , or any of her activity . 
Mrs. Price	sure	, I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times ; have not I , Betsey ? 
Dr. Grant	contented	It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both with her , and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so : a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society to an indolent , stay - at - home man ; and Mr. Crawford ’s being his guest was an excuse for drinking claret every day 
Dr. Grant	kind	And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me , and though he is really a gentleman , and , I dare say , a good scholar and clever , and often preaches good sermons , and is very respectable , _ I _ see him to be an indolent , selfish _ bon _ _ vivant _ , who must have his palate consulted in everything ; who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one ; and who , moreover , if the cook makes a blunder , is out of humour with his excellent wife . 
Dr. Grant	obliging	And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me , and though he is really a gentleman , and , I dare say , a good scholar and clever , and often preaches good sermons , and is very respectable , _ I _ see him to be an indolent , selfish _ bon _ _ vivant _ , who must have his palate consulted in everything ; who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one ; and who , moreover , if the cook makes a blunder , is out of humour with his excellent wife .

Dr. Grant	ill	“ Dr. Grant is ill , ” said she , with mock solemnity . 
Dr. Grant	ill	“ He has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today . 
Dr. Grant	glad	“ Very well , very well , ” cried Dr. Grant , “ all the better ; I am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house .
