3439	3446	3432	3433	Mrs. Allen	86	“ it is very uncomfortable indeed . ”
3447	3478	3412	3412	Catherine	73	“ What shall we do ? The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here — we seem forcing ourselves into their party . ”
3479	3500	3432	3433	Mrs. Allen	86	“ Aye , so we do . That is very disagreeable . I wish we had a large acquaintance here . ”
3501	3515	3412	3412	Catherine	73	“ I wish we had _ any;_—it would be somebody to go to . ”
3516	3548	3432	3433	Mrs. Allen	86	“ Very true , my dear ; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly . The Skinners were here last year — I wish they were here now . ”
3549	3572	3412	3412	Catherine	73	“ Had not we better go away as it is ? Here are no tea - things for us , you see . ”
3573	3626	3432	3433	Mrs. Allen	86	“ No more there are , indeed . How very provoking ! but I think we had better sit still , for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd ! how is my head , my dear ? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it , I am afraid . ”
3627	3667	3412	3412	Catherine	73	“ No , indeed , it looks very nice . But , dear Mrs. Allen , are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people ? I think you _ must _ know somebody . ”
3668	3743	3432	3433	Mrs. Allen	86	“ I do n’t , upon my word — I wish I did . I wish I had a large acquaintance here with all my heart , and then I should get you a partner . I should be so glad to have you dance . There goes a strange - looking woman ! what an odd gown she has got on ! how old - fashioned it is ! look at the back . ”
3806	3812	3814	3814	he	83	“ Well , Miss Morland , ”
3818	3828	3814	3814	he	83	“ I hope you have had an agreeable ball . ”
3829	3834	3835	3835	she	336	“ Very agreeable indeed , ”

3861	3925	3858	3859	his wife	337	“ I wish we could have got a partner for her . I have been saying how glad I should be if the Skinners were here this winter instead of last ; or if the Parrys had come , as they talked of once , she might have danced with George Parry . I am so sorry she has not had a partner ! ”
3926	3936	3938	3939	Mr. Allen	83	“ We shall do better another evening I hope , ”
4471	4561	4600	4600	he	368	with—“I have hitherto been very remiss , madam , in the proper attentions of a partner here ; I have not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath ; whether you were ever here before ; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms , the theatre , and the concert ; and how you like the place altogether . I have been very negligent — but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars ? If you are I will begin directly . ”
4562	4573	4600	4600	he	368	“ You need not give yourself that trouble , sir . ”
4574	4584	4600	4600	he	368	“ No trouble , I assure you , madam . ”
4608	4618	4600	4600	he	368	“ Have you been long in Bath , madam ? ”
4619	4626	4628	4628	Catherine	73	“ About a week , sir , ”
4635	4638	4600	4600	he	368	“ Really ! ”
4643	4652	4600	4600	he	368	“ Why should you be surprised , sir ? ”
4653	4658	4660	4660	he	368	“ Why , indeed ! ”
4667	4709	4660	4660	he	368	“ But some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply , and surprise is more easily assumed , and not less reasonable than any other . Now let us go on . Were you never here before , madam ? ”
4710	4715	4600	4600	he	368	“ Never , sir . ”
4716	4727	4660	4660	he	368	“ Indeed ! have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms ? ”
4728	4739	4600	4600	he	368	“ Yes , sir , I was there last Monday . ”
4740	4748	4660	4660	he	368	“ Have you been to the theatre ? ”
4749	4762	4600	4600	he	368	“ Yes , sir , I was at the play on Tuesday . ”
4763	4768	4660	4660	he	368	“ To the concert ? ”
4769	4777	4600	4600	he	368	“ Yes , sir , on Wednesday . ”
4778	4787	4660	4660	he	368	“ And are you altogether pleased with Bath ? ”
4788	4797	4600	4600	he	368	“ Yes — I like it very well . ”
4798	4814	4660	4660	he	368	“ Now I must give one smirk , and then we may be rational again . ”
4830	4839	4841	4841	he	370	“ I see what you think of me , ”
4842	4856	4600	4600	he	368	gravely—“I shall make but a poor figure in your journal to - morrow . ”
4857	4861	4600	4600	he	368	“ My journal ! ”
4862	4927	4600	4600	he	368	“ Yes , I know exactly what you will say : Friday , went to the Lower Rooms ; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings — plain black shoes — appeared to much advantage ; but was strangely harassed by a queer , half - witted man , who would make me dance with him , and distressed me by his nonsense . ”
4928	4937	4600	4600	he	368	“ Indeed I shall say no such thing . ”
4938	4949	4600	4600	he	368	“ Shall I tell you what you ought to say ? ”
4950	4955	4600	4600	he	368	“ If you please . ”
4956	5010	4600	4600	he	368	“ I danced with a very agreeable young man , introduced by Mr. King ; had a great deal of conversation with him — seems a most extraordinary genius — hope I may know more of him . _ That _ , madam , is what I _ wish _ you to say . ”
5011	5021	4600	4600	he	368	“ But , perhaps , I keep no journal . ”
5022	5220	4600	4600	he	368	“ Perhaps you are not sitting in this room , and I am not sitting by you . These are points in which a doubt is equally possible . Not keep a journal ! how are your absent cousins to understand the tenor of your life in Bath without one ? How are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be , unless noted down every evening in a journal ? How are your various dresses to be remembered , and the particular state of your complexion , and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities , without having constant recourse to a journal ? My dear madam , I am not so ignorant of young ladies ’ ways as you wish to believe me ; it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated . Everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female . Nature may have done something , but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal . ”
5221	5227	5229	5229	Catherine	73	“ I have sometimes thought , ”
5233	5260	5229	5229	Catherine	73	“ whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen ! that is — I should not think the superiority was always on our side . ”
5261	5294	4600	4600	he	368	“ As far as I have had opportunity of judging , it appears to me that the usual style of letter - writing among women is faultless , except in three particulars . ”
5295	5301	5229	5229	Catherine	73	“ And what are they ? ”
5302	5323	4600	4600	he	368	“ A general deficiency of subject , a total inattention to stops , and a very frequent ignorance of grammar . ”
5324	5352	5229	5229	Catherine	73	“ Upon my word ! i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment . You do not think too highly of us in that way . ”
5353	5405	4600	4600	he	368	“ I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men , than that they sing better duets , or draw better landscapes . In every power , of which taste is the foundation , excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes . ”
5413	5418	5420	5420	she	372	“ My dear Catherine , ”
5422	5467	5420	5420	she	372	“ do take this pin out of my sleeve ; I am afraid it has torn a hole already ; I shall be quite sorry if it has , for this is a favourite gown , though it cost but nine shillings a yard . ”
5468	5481	5483	5484	Mr. Tilney	92	“ That is exactly what I should have guessed it , madam , ”
5491	5499	4600	4600	he	368	“ Do you understand muslins , sir ? ”
5500	5575	5420	5420	she	372	“ Particularly well ; I always buy my own cravats , and am allowed to be an excellent judge ; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown . I bought one for her the other day , and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it . I gave but five shillings a yard for it , and a true Indian muslin . ”
5585	5596	5598	5598	she	373	“ Men commonly take so little notice of those things , ”
5600	5628	5598	5598	she	373	“ I can never get Mr. Allen to know one of my gowns from another . You must be a great comfort to your sister , sir . ”
5629	5637	5420	5420	she	372	“ I hope I am , madam . ”
5638	5654	5598	5598	she	373	“ And pray , sir , what do you think of Miss Morland ’s gown ? ”
5655	5663	5665	5665	he	92	“ It is very pretty , madam , ”
5671	5689	5665	5665	he	92	“ but I do not think it will wash well ; I am afraid it will fray . ”
5690	5695	5697	5697	Catherine	73	“ How can you , ”
5701	5705	5697	5697	Catherine	73	“ be so — ”
5710	5713	5706	5706	She	373	“ strange . ”
5714	5724	5726	5727	Mrs. Allen	86	“ I am quite of your opinion , sir , ”
5729	5741	5726	5727	Mrs. Allen	86	“ and so I told Miss Morland when she bought it . ”
5742	5818	5665	5665	he	92	“ But then you know , madam , muslin always turns to some account or other ; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief , or a cap , or a cloak . Muslin can never be said to be wasted . I have heard my sister say so forty times , when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted , or careless in cutting it to pieces . ”
5819	5923	5938	5938	she	374	“ Bath is a charming place , sir ; there are so many good shops here . We are sadly off in the country ; not but what we have very good shops in Salisbury , but it is so far to go — eight miles is a long way ; Mr. Allen says it is nine , measured nine ; but I am sure it can not be more than eight ; and it is such a fag — I come back tired to death . Now , here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes . ”
5975	5984	5986	5986	he	92	“ What are you thinking of so earnestly ? ”
5996	6020	5986	5986	he	92	“ not of your partner , I hope , for , by that shake of the head , your meditations are not satisfactory . ”
6027	6035	6021	6021	Catherine	73	“ I was not thinking of anything . ”
6036	6062	6021	6021	Catherine	73	“ That is artful and deep , to be sure ; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me . ”
6063	6071	6021	6021	Catherine	73	“ Well then , I will not . ”
6072	6108	6021	6021	Catherine	73	“ Thank you ; for now we shall soon be acquainted , as I am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet , and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much . ”
6464	6472	6474	6475	Mrs. Allen	86	“ What a delightful place Bath is , ”
6494	6508	6474	6475	Mrs. Allen	86	“ and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here . ”
6541	6549	6593	6599	a lady of about her own age	403	“ despair of nothing we would attain , ”
6551	6558	6593	6599	a lady of about her own age	403	“ unwearied diligence our point would gain ”
6627	6660	6593	6599	a lady of about her own age	403	“ I think , madam , I can not be mistaken ; it is a long time since I had the pleasure of seeing you , but is not your name Allen ? ”
6988	6995	6997	6998	Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ Here come my dear girls , ”
7019	7072	6997	6998	Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ My dear Mrs. Allen , I long to introduce them ; they will be so delighted to see you : the tallest is Isabella , my eldest ; is not she a fine young woman ? The others are very much admired too , but I believe Isabella is the handsomest . ”
7124	7134	7114	7117	the eldest young lady	422	“ How excessively like her brother Miss Morland is ! ”
7135	7143	7145	7146	the mother	424	“ The very picture of him indeed ! ”
7149	7160	7145	7146	the mother	424	“ I should have known her anywhere for his sister ! ”
8367	8378	8357	8357	She	101	“ for she must confess herself very partial to the profession ”
8508	8518	8519	8519	They	481	“ I wish we had some acquaintance in Bath ! ”
8524	8536	8538	8538	she	96	“ How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe ! ”
9056	9090	9011	9011	Sterne	105	“ I am no novel - reader — I seldom look into novels — Do not imagine that _ I _ often read novels — It is really very well for a novel . ”
9098	9109	9011	9011	Sterne	105	“ And what are you reading , Miss — — ? ”
9110	9119	9126	9126	she	502	“ Oh ! it is only a novel ! ”
9139	9150	9126	9126	she	502	“ It is only Cecilia , or Camilla , or Belinda ”
9416	9440	9410	9410	her	108	“ My dearest creature , what can have made you so late ? I have been waiting for you at least this age ! ”
9441	9480	9410	9410	her	108	“ Have you , indeed ! i am very sorry for it ; but really I thought I was in very good time . It is but just one . I hope you have not been here long ? ”
9481	9634	9410	9410	her	108	“ Oh ! these ten ages at least . I am sure I have been here this half hour . But now , let us go and sit down at the other end of the room , and enjoy ourselves . I have an hundred things to say to you . In the first place , I was so afraid it would rain this morning , just as I wanted to set off ; it looked very showery , and that would have thrown me into agonies ! do you know , I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine , in a shop window in Milsom Street just now — very like yours , only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green ; I quite longed for it . But , my dearest Catherine , what have you been doing with yourself all this morning ? Have you gone on with Udolpho ? ”
9635	9657	9410	9410	her	108	“ Yes , I have been reading it ever since I woke ; and I am got to the black veil . ”
9658	9691	9410	9410	her	108	“ Are you , indeed ? How delightful ! oh ! i would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world ! are not you wild to know ? ”
9692	9783	9410	9410	her	108	“ Oh ! yes , quite ; what can it be ? But do not tell me — I would not be told upon any account . I know it must be a skeleton , I am sure it is Laurentina ’s skeleton . Oh ! i am delighted with the book ! i should like to spend my whole life in reading it . I assure you , if it had not been to meet you , I would not have come away from it for all the world . ”
9784	9829	9410	9410	her	108	“ Dear creature ! how much I am obliged to you ; and when you have finished Udolpho , we will read the Italian together ; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you . ”
9830	9846	9410	9410	her	108	“ Have you , indeed ! how glad I am ! what are they all ? ”
9847	9898	9410	9410	her	108	“ I will read you their names directly ; here they are , in my pocketbook . Castle of Wolfenbach , Clermont , Mysterious Warnings , Necromancer of the Black Forest , Midnight Bell , Orphan of the Rhine , and Horrid Mysteries . Those will last us some time . ”
9899	9919	9410	9410	her	108	“ Yes , pretty well ; but are they all horrid , are you sure they are all horrid ? ”
9920	10012	9410	9410	her	108	“ Yes , quite sure ; for a particular friend of mine , a Miss Andrews , a sweet girl , one of the sweetest creatures in the world , has read every one of them . I wish you knew Miss Andrews , you would be delighted with her . She is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive . I think her as beautiful as an angel , and I am so vexed with the men for not admiring her ! i scold them all amazingly about it . ”
10013	10026	9410	9410	her	108	“ Scold them ! do you scold them for not admiring her ? ”
10027	10184	9410	9410	her	108	“ Yes , that I do . There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends . I have no notion of loving people by halves ; it is not my nature . My attachments are always excessively strong . I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night , I would not dance with him , unless he would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel . The men think us incapable of real friendship , you know , and I am determined to show them the difference . Now , if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you , I should fire up in a moment : but that is not at all likely , for _ you _ are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men . ”
10185	10190	10192	10192	Catherine	73	“ Oh , dear ! ”
10196	10203	10192	10192	Catherine	73	“ How can you say so ? ”
10204	10272	10273	10273	Catherine	73	“ I know you very well ; you have so much animation , which is exactly what Miss Andrews wants , for I must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her . Oh ! i must tell you , that just after we parted yesterday , I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly — I am sure he is in love with you . ”
10283	10325	10280	10280	Isabella	108	“ It is very true , upon my honour , but I see how it is ; you are indifferent to everybody ’s admiration , except that of one gentleman , who shall be nameless . Nay , I can not blame you”—speaking
10327	10381	10192	10192	Catherine	73	seriously—“your feelings are easily understood . Where the heart is really attached , I know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else . Everything is so insipid , so uninteresting , that does not relate to the beloved object ! i can perfectly comprehend your feelings . ”
10382	10408	10280	10280	Isabella	108	“ But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr. Tilney , for perhaps I may never see him again . ”
10409	10437	10192	10192	Catherine	73	“ Not see him again ! my dearest creature , do not talk of it . I am sure you would be miserable if you thought so ! ”
10438	10504	10280	10280	Isabella	108	“ No , indeed , I should not . I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him ; but while I have Udolpho to read , I feel as if nobody could make me miserable . Oh ! the dreadful black veil ! my dear Isabella , I am sure there must be Laurentina ’s skeleton behind it . ”
10505	10531	10192	10192	Catherine	73	“ It is so odd to me , that you should never have read Udolpho before ; but I suppose Mrs. Morland objects to novels . ”
10532	10558	10280	10280	Isabella	108	“ No , she does not . She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself ; but new books do not fall in our way . ”
10559	10587	10192	10192	Catherine	73	“ Sir Charles Grandison ! that is an amazing horrid book , is it not ? I remember Miss Andrews could not get through the first volume . ”
10588	10606	10280	10280	Isabella	108	“ It is not like Udolpho at all ; but yet I think it is very entertaining . ”
10607	10669	10192	10192	Catherine	73	“ Do you indeed ! you surprise me ; I thought it had not been readable . But , my dearest Catherine , have you settled what to wear on your head to - night ? I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you . The men take notice of _ that _ sometimes , you know . ”
10670	10680	10682	10682	Catherine	73	“ But it does not signify if they do , ”
10687	10728	10192	10192	Catherine	73	“ Signify ! oh , heavens ! i make it a rule never to mind what they say . They are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit , and make them keep their distance . ”
10729	10750	10192	10192	Catherine	73	“ Are they ? Well , I never observed _ that _ . They always behave very well to me . ”
10751	10817	10192	10192	Catherine	73	“ Oh ! they give themselves such airs . They are the most conceited creatures in the world , and think themselves of so much importance ! by the by , though I have thought of it a hundred times , I have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man . Do you like them best dark or fair ? ”
10818	10849	10192	10192	Catherine	73	“ I hardly know . I never much thought about it . Something between both , I think . Brown — not fair , and — and not very dark . ”
10850	10933	10192	10192	Catherine	73	“ Very well , Catherine . That is exactly he . I have not forgot your description of Mr. Tilney—‘a brown skin , with dark eyes , and rather dark hair . ’ Well , my taste is different . I prefer light eyes , and as to complexion — do you know — I like a sallow better than any other . You must not betray me , if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description . ”
10934	10943	10192	10192	Catherine	73	“ Betray you ! what do you mean ? ”
10944	10966	10192	10192	Catherine	73	“ Nay , do not distress me . I believe I have said too much . Let us drop the subject . ”
11018	11080	11010	11011	her friend	305	“ For heaven ’s sake ! Let us move away from this end of the room . Do you know , there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour . They really put me quite out of countenance . Let us go and look at the arrivals . They will hardly follow us there . ”
11110	11151	11156	11156	Catherine	73	“ They are not coming this way , are they ? I hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us . Pray let me know if they are coming . I am determined I will not look up . ”
11183	11191	11193	11193	Isabella	108	“ And which way are they gone ? ”
11199	11210	11193	11193	Isabella	108	“ One was a very good - looking young man . ”
11211	11220	11156	11156	Catherine	73	“ They went towards the church - yard . ”
11221	11266	11193	11193	Isabella	108	“ Well , I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them ! and now , what say you to going to Edgar ’s Buildings with me , and looking at my new hat ? You said you should like to see it . ”
11271	11274	11275	11275	she	108	“ Only , ”
11278	11288	11275	11275	she	108	“ perhaps we may overtake the two young men . ”
11289	11318	11156	11156	Catherine	73	“ Oh ! never mind that . If we make haste , we shall pass by them presently , and I am dying to show you my hat . ”
11319	11341	11275	11275	she	108	“ But if we only wait a few minutes , there will be no danger of our seeing them at all . ”
11342	11377	11156	11156	Catherine	73	“ I shall not pay them any such compliment , I assure you . I have no notion of treating men with such respect . _ That _ is the way to spoil them . ”
11665	11672	11674	11674	Isabella	108	“ Oh , these odious gigs ! ”
11679	11685	11674	11674	Isabella	108	“ How I detest them . ”
11706	11716	11700	11700	she	108	“ Delightful ! mr . Morland and my brother ! ”
11717	11725	11733	11733	Catherine	73	“ Good heaven ! ’ Tis James ! ”
12033	12050	12027	12027	He	2287	“ How long do you think we have been running it from Tetbury , Miss Morland ? ”
12051	12059	12060	12061	Her brother	2287	“ I do not know the distance . ”
12072	12078	12080	12080	Thorpe	95	“ _ Three_-and - twenty ! ”
12082	12094	12080	12080	Thorpe	95	“ five - and - twenty if it is an inch . ”
12126	12138	12140	12140	he	2287	“ I know it must be five - and - twenty , ”
12142	12205	12140	12140	he	2287	“ by the time we have been doing it . It is now half after one ; we drove out of the inn - yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven ; and I defy any man in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness ; that makes it exactly twenty - five . ”
12206	12213	12215	12215	Morland	84	“ You have lost an hour , ”
12217	12229	12215	12215	Morland	84	“ it was only ten o’clock when we came from Tetbury . ”
12230	12283	12285	12286	The servant	543	“ Ten o’clock ! it was eleven , upon my soul ! i counted every stroke . This brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses , Miss Morland ; do but look at my horse ; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life ? ”
12298	12330	12285	12286	The servant	543	“ Such true blood ! three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles ! look at that creature , and suppose it possible if you can . ”
12331	12344	12215	12215	Morland	84	“ He _ does _ look very hot , to be sure . ”
12345	12597	12285	12286	The servant	543	“ Hot ! he had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church ; but look at his forehand ; look at his loins ; only see how he moves ; that horse _ can not _ go less than ten miles an hour : tie his legs and he will get on . What do you think of my gig , Miss Morland ? A neat one , is not it ? Well hung ; town - built ; I have not had it a month . It was built for a Christchurch man , a friend of mine , a very good sort of fellow ; he ran it a few weeks , till , I believe , it was convenient to have done with it . I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind , though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too ; but I chanced to meet him on Magdalen Bridge , as he was driving into Oxford , last term : ‘ Ah ! thorpe , ’ said he , ‘ do you happen to want such a little thing as this ? It is a capital one of the kind , but I am cursed tired of it . ’ ‘ Oh ! d — , ’ said I ; ‘ I am your man ; what do you ask ? ’ And how much do you think he did , Miss Morland ? ”
12598	12609	12215	12215	Morland	84	“ I am sure I can not guess at all . ”
12610	12674	12285	12286	The servant	543	“ Curricle - hung , you see ; seat , trunk , sword - case , splashing - board , lamps , silver moulding , all you see complete ; the iron - work as good as new , or better . He asked fifty guineas ; I closed with him directly , threw down the money , and the carriage was mine . ”
12675	12681	12683	12683	Catherine	73	“ And I am sure , ”
12685	12705	12683	12683	Catherine	73	“ I know so little of such things that I can not judge whether it was cheap or dear . ”
12706	12735	12285	12286	The servant	543	“ Neither one nor t’other ; I might have got it for less , I dare say ; but I hate haggling , and poor Freeman wanted cash . ”
12736	12746	12748	12748	Catherine	73	“ That was very good - natured of you , ”
12753	12781	12285	12286	The servant	543	“ Oh ! d — — it , when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend , I hate to be pitiful . ”
12944	12998	12920	12921	John Thorpe	97	“ You will find , however , Miss Morland , it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people , for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day ; Jackson , of Oriel , bid me sixty at once ; Morland was with me at the time . ”
12999	13002	13004	13004	Morland	84	“ Yes , ”
13010	13020	13004	13004	Morland	84	“ but you forget that your horse was included . ”
13021	13053	12920	12921	John Thorpe	97	“ My horse ! oh , d — — it ! i would not sell my horse for a hundred . Are you fond of an open carriage , Miss Morland ? ”
13054	13078	13004	13004	Morland	84	“ Yes , very ; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one ; but I am particularly fond of it . ”
13079	13096	12920	12921	John Thorpe	97	“ I am glad of it ; I will drive you out in mine every day . ”
13097	13101	13103	13103	Catherine	73	“ Thank you , ”
13121	13133	12920	12921	John Thorpe	97	“ I will drive you up Lansdown Hill to - morrow . ”
13134	13146	12920	12921	John Thorpe	97	“ Thank you ; but will not your horse want rest ? ”
13147	13201	12920	12921	John Thorpe	97	“ Rest ! he has only come three and twenty miles to - day ; all nonsense ; nothing ruins horses so much as rest ; nothing knocks them up so soon . No , no ; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while I am here . ”
13202	13207	13209	13209	Catherine	73	“ Shall you indeed ! ”
13213	13222	13209	13209	Catherine	73	“ That will be forty miles a day . ”
13223	13253	12920	12921	John Thorpe	97	“ Forty ! aye , fifty , for what I care . Well , I will drive you up Lansdown to - morrow ; mind , I am engaged . ”
13254	13261	13263	13263	Isabella	108	“ How delightful that will be ! ”
13268	13294	13263	13263	Isabella	108	“ My dearest Catherine , I quite envy you ; but I am afraid , brother , you will not have room for a third . ”
13295	13332	12920	12921	John Thorpe	97	“ A third indeed ! no , no ; I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about ; that would be a good joke , faith ! morland must take care of you . ”
13464	13474	13513	13513	he	573	“ Have you ever read Udolpho , Mr. Thorpe ? ”
13475	13497	13513	13513	he	573	“ Udolpho ! oh , Lord ! not I ; I never read novels ; I have something else to do . ”
13519	13569	13513	13513	he	573	“ Novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff ; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since Tom Jones , except The Monk ; I read that t’other day ; but as for all the others , they are the stupidest things in creation . ”
13570	13591	13513	13513	he	573	“ I think you must like Udolpho , if you were to read it ; it is so very interesting . ”
13592	13632	13513	13513	he	573	“ Not I , faith ! no , if I read any , it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe ’s ; her novels are amusing enough ; they are worth reading ; some fun and nature in _ them _ . ”
13633	13641	13643	13643	Catherine	73	“ Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe , ”
13656	13700	13513	13513	he	573	“ No , sure ; was it ? Aye , I remember , so it was ; I was thinking of that other stupid book , written by that woman they make such a fuss about , she who married the French emigrant . ”
13701	13708	13513	13513	he	573	“ I suppose you mean Camilla ? ”
13709	13790	13513	13513	he	573	“ Yes , that ’s the book ; such unnatural stuff ! an old man playing at see - saw , I took up the first volume once and looked it over , but I soon found it would not do ; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be before I saw it : as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant , I was sure I should never be able to get through it . ”
13791	13798	13513	13513	he	573	“ I have never read it . ”
13799	13847	13513	13513	he	573	“ You had no loss , I assure you ; it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine ; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man ’s playing at see - saw and learning Latin ; upon my soul there is not . ”
13913	13923	13925	13925	he	579	“ Ah , Mother ! How do you do ? ”
13936	13984	13925	13925	he	579	“ Where did you get that quiz of a hat ? It makes you look like an old witch . Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you , so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near . ”
14213	14226	14201	14201	James	103	“ Well , Catherine , how do you like my friend Thorpe ? ”
14250	14259	14260	14260	she	96	“ I do not like him at all , ”
14264	14276	14260	14260	she	96	“ I like him very much ; he seems very agreeable . ”
14277	14319	14232	14232	she	96	“ He is as good - natured a fellow as ever lived ; a little of a rattle ; but that will recommend him to your sex , I believe : and how do you like the rest of the family ? ”
14320	14330	14260	14260	she	96	“ Very , very much indeed : Isabella particularly . ”
14331	14418	14232	14232	she	96	“ I am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you . She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be ; and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you , Catherine , ”
14425	14431	14232	14232	she	96	“ may be proud of . ”
14432	14437	14438	14438	she	591	“ Indeed I am , ”
14441	14474	14438	14438	she	591	“ I love her exceedingly , and am delighted to find that you like her too . You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there . ”
14475	14547	14260	14260	she	96	“ Because I thought I should soon see you myself . I hope you will be a great deal together while you are in Bath . She is a most amiable girl ; such a superior understanding ! how fond all the family are of her ; she is evidently the general favourite ; and how much she must be admired in such a place as this — is not she ? ”
14548	14568	14438	14438	she	591	“ Yes , very much indeed , I fancy ; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath . ”
14569	14643	14260	14260	she	96	“ I dare say he does ; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen . I need not ask you whether you are happy here , my dear Catherine ; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe , it would be impossible for you to be otherwise ; and the Allens , I am sure , are very kind to you ? ”
14644	14688	14438	14438	she	591	“ Yes , very kind ; I never was so happy before ; and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever ; how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see _ me _ . ”
14711	14721	14698	14698	his	103	“ Indeed , Catherine , I love you dearly . ”
15128	15133	15135	15135	she	446	“ I assure you , ”
15137	15165	15135	15135	she	446	“ I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world ; for if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening . ”
15208	15261	15185	15185	Isabella	101	“ My dear creature , I am afraid I must leave you , your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin ; I know you will not mind my going away , and I dare say John will be back in a moment , and then you may easily find me out . ”
15298	15307	15280	15281	the others	2286	“ Good - bye , my dear love , ”
15839	15861	15862	15862	He	92	“ I am very happy to see you again , sir , indeed ; I was afraid you had left Bath . ”
15894	15995	15828	15829	Mrs. Allen	86	“ Well , sir , and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again , for it is just the place for young people — and indeed for everybody else too . I tell Mr. Allen , when he talks of being sick of it , that I am sure he should not complain , for it is so very agreeable a place , that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year . I tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health . ”
15996	16022	16117	16117	she	96	“ And I hope , madam , that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place , from finding it of service to him . ”
16023	16059	15828	15829	Mrs. Allen	86	“ Thank you , sir . I have no doubt that he will . A neighbour of ours , Dr. Skinner , was here for his health last winter , and came away quite stout . ”
16060	16068	16117	16117	she	96	“ That circumstance must give great encouragement . ”
16069	16101	15828	15829	Mrs. Allen	86	“ Yes , sir — and Dr. Skinner and his family were here three months ; so I tell Mr. Allen he must not be in a hurry to get away . ”
16441	16450	16452	16452	she	378	“ I beg your pardon , Miss Morland , ”
16454	16492	16452	16452	she	378	“ for this liberty — but I can not anyhow get to Miss Thorpe , and Mrs. Thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you . ”
16817	16865	16807	16807	her	125	“ At last I have got you . My dearest creature , I have been looking for you this hour . What could induce you to come into this set , when you knew I was in the other ? I have been quite wretched without you . ”
16866	16891	17005	17005	James	103	“ My dear Isabella , how was it possible for me to get at you ? I could not even see where you were . ”
16892	16982	16807	16807	her	125	“ So I told your brother all the time — but he would not believe me . Do go and see for her , Mr. Morland , said I — but all in vain — he would not stir an inch . Was not it so , Mr. Morland ? But you men are all so immoderately lazy ! i have been scolding him to such a degree , my dear Catherine , you would be quite amazed . You know I never stand upon ceremony with such people . ”
16983	16997	16999	16999	Catherine	73	“ Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head , ”
17007	17015	16999	16999	Catherine	73	“ It is Mr. Tilney ’s sister . ”
17016	17097	16807	16807	her	125	“ Oh ! heavens ! you do n’t say so ! let me look at her this moment . What a delightful girl ! i never saw anything half so beautiful ! but where is her all - conquering brother ? Is he in the room ? Point him out to me this instant , if he is . I die to see him . Mr. Morland , you are not to listen . We are not talking about you . ”
17098	17112	16999	16999	Catherine	73	“ But what is all this whispering about ? What is going on ? ”
17113	17161	16807	16807	her	125	“ There now , I knew how it would be . You men have such restless curiosity ! talk of the curiosity of women , indeed ! ’ Tis nothing . But be satisfied , for you are not to know anything at all of the matter . ”
17162	17175	16999	16999	Catherine	73	“ And is that likely to satisfy me , do you think ? ”
17176	17228	16807	16807	her	125	“ Well , I declare I never knew anything like you . What can it signify to you , what we are talking of . Perhaps we are talking about you ; therefore I would advise you not to listen , or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable . ”
17305	17313	17314	17314	she	659	“ I tell you , Mr. Morland , ”
17317	17397	17314	17314	she	659	“ I would not do such a thing for all the world . How can you be so teasing ; only conceive , my dear Catherine , what your brother wants me to do . He wants me to dance with him again , though I tell him that it is a most improper thing , and entirely against the rules . It would make us the talk of the place , if we were not to change partners . ”
17398	17403	17405	17405	James	103	“ Upon my honour , ”
17407	17421	17405	17405	James	103	“ in these public assemblies , it is as often done as not . ”
17422	17484	17314	17314	she	659	“ Nonsense , how can you say so ? But when you men have a point to carry , you never stick at anything . My sweet Catherine , do support me ; persuade your brother how impossible it is . Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing ; now would not it ? ”
17485	17505	17405	17405	James	103	“ No , not at all ; but if you think it wrong , you had much better change . ”
17506	17509	17511	17511	Isabella	101	“ There , ”
17513	17569	17511	17511	Isabella	101	“ you hear what your sister says , and yet you will not mind her . Well , remember that it is not my fault , if we set all the old ladies in Bath in a bustle . Come along , my dearest Catherine , for heaven ’s sake , and stand by me . ”
17659	17665	17667	17668	Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ Well , my dear , ”
17677	17687	17667	17668	Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ I hope you have had an agreeable partner . ”
17688	17694	17651	17651	she	663	“ Very agreeable , madam . ”
17695	17711	17667	17668	Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ I am glad of it . John has charming spirits , has not he ? ”
17712	17722	17724	17725	Mrs. Allen	86	“ Did you meet Mr. Tilney , my dear ? ”
17727	17734	17667	17668	Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ No , where is he ? ”
17735	17777	17667	17668	Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ He was with us just now , and said he was so tired of lounging about , that he was resolved to go and dance ; so I thought perhaps he would ask you , if he met with you . ”
17778	17784	17786	17786	Catherine	73	“ Where can he be ? ”
17810	17828	17830	17831	Mrs. Allen	86	“ Ah ! he has got a partner ; I wish he had asked _ you _ , ”
17842	17851	17839	17839	she	241	“ he is a very agreeable young man . ”
17852	17860	17862	17863	Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ Indeed he is , Mrs. Allen , ”
17868	17895	17862	17863	Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ I must say it , though I _ am _ his mother , that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world . ”
17935	17948	17926	17926	she	241	“ I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son . ”
17997	18018	17986	17987	John Thorpe	97	“ Well , Miss Morland , I suppose you and I are to stand up and jig it together again . ”
18019	18054	17986	17987	John Thorpe	97	“ Oh , no ; I am much obliged to you , our two dances are over ; and , besides , I am tired , and do not mean to dance any more . ”
18055	18105	18114	18114	he	669	“ Do not you ? Then let us walk about and quiz people . Come along with me , and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room ; my two younger sisters and their partners . I have been laughing at them this half hour . ”
18198	18202	18178	18179	the latter	562	“ dearest Catherine . ”
18625	18733	18616	18617	John Thorpe	97	“ Well , Miss Morland , here I am . Have you been waiting long ? We could not come before ; the old devil of a coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into , and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out of the street . How do you do , Mrs. Allen ? A famous ball last night , was not it ? Come , Miss Morland , be quick , for the others are in a confounded hurry to be off . They want to get their tumble over . ”
18734	18740	18742	18742	Catherine	73	“ What do you mean ? ”
18744	18752	18742	18742	Catherine	73	“ Where are you all going to ? ”
18753	18791	18616	18617	John Thorpe	97	“ Going to ? Why , you have not forgot our engagement ! did not we agree together to take a drive this morning ? What a head you have ! we are going up Claverton Down . ”
18792	18802	18804	18804	Catherine	73	“ Something was said about it , I remember , ”
18814	18823	18804	18804	Catherine	73	“ but really I did not expect you . ”
18824	18850	18811	18811	her	688	“ Not expect me ! that ’s a good one ! and what a dust you would have made , if I had not come . ”
18955	18981	18934	18935	Mr. Thorpe	119	“ Well , ma’am , what do you say to it ? Can you spare me for an hour or two ? Shall I go ? ”
18982	18992	18994	18995	Mrs. Allen	86	“ Do just as you please , my dear , ”
19069	19074	19076	19076	Isabella	101	“ My dearest creature , ”
19095	19146	19076	19076	Isabella	101	“ you have been at least three hours getting ready . I was afraid you were ill . What a delightful ball we had last night . I have a thousand things to say to you ; but make haste and get in , for I long to be off . ”
19168	19182	19166	19166	James	103	“ What a sweet girl she is ! i quite dote on her . ”
19183	19193	19195	19195	Thorpe	119	“ You will not be frightened , Miss Morland , ”
19203	19265	19195	19195	Thorpe	119	“ if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off . He will , most likely , give a plunge or two , and perhaps take the rest for a minute ; but he will soon know his master . He is full of spirits , playful as can be , but there is no vice in him . ”
19348	19354	19333	19339	the servant who stood at the horse	697	“ to let him go , ”
19580	19594	19599	19599	him	569	“ Old Allen is as rich as a Jew — is not he ? ”
19611	19621	19602	19602	he	569	“ Old Allen , the man you are with . ”
19622	19642	19602	19602	he	569	“ Oh ! mr . Allen , you mean . Yes , I believe , he is very rich . ”
19643	19650	19602	19602	he	569	“ And no children at all ? ”
19651	19657	19602	19602	he	569	“ No — not any . ”
19658	19678	19602	19602	he	569	“ A famous thing for his next heirs . He is _ your _ godfather , is not he ? ”
19679	19685	19602	19602	he	569	“ My godfather ! no . ”
19686	19696	19602	19602	he	569	“ But you are always very much with them . ”
19697	19703	19602	19602	he	569	“ Yes , very much . ”
19704	19752	19602	19602	he	569	“ Aye , that is what I meant . He seems a good kind of old fellow enough , and has lived very well in his time , I dare say ; he is not gouty for nothing . Does he drink his bottle a day now ? ”
19753	19788	19602	19602	he	569	“ His bottle a day ! no . Why should you think of such a thing ? He is a very temperate man , and you could not fancy him in liquor last night ? ”
19789	19861	19602	19602	he	569	“ Lord help you ! you women are always thinking of men ’s being in liquor . Why , you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle ? I am sure of _ this_—that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day , there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now . It would be a famous good thing for us all . ”
19862	19869	19602	19602	he	569	“ I can not believe it . ”
19870	19908	19602	19602	he	569	“ Oh ! lord , it would be the saving of thousands . There is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be . Our foggy climate wants help . ”
19909	19927	19602	19602	he	569	“ And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford . ”
19928	20055	19602	19602	he	569	“ Oxford ! there is no drinking at Oxford now , I assure you . Nobody drinks there . You would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost . Now , for instance , it was reckoned a remarkable thing , at the last party in my rooms , that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head . It was looked upon as something out of the common way . _ Mine _ is famous good stuff , to be sure . You would not often meet with anything like it in Oxford — and that may account for it . But this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there . ”
20056	20065	20067	20067	Catherine	73	“ Yes , it does give a notion , ”
20070	20102	20067	20067	Catherine	73	“ and that is , that you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did . However , I am sure James does not drink so much . ”
20336	20346	20348	20348	Catherine	73	“ You do not really think , Mr. Thorpe , ”
20372	20381	20348	20348	Catherine	73	“ that James ’s gig will break down ? ”
20382	20485	20348	20348	Catherine	73	“ Break down ! oh , lord ! did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life ? There is not a sound piece of iron about it . The wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least — and as for the body ! upon my soul , you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch . It is the most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld ! thank God ! we have got a better . I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds . ”
20486	20490	20492	20492	Catherine	73	“ Good heavens ! ”
20497	20542	20492	20492	Catherine	73	“ Then pray let us turn back ; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on . Do let us turn back , Mr. Thorpe ; stop and speak to my brother , and tell him how very unsafe it is . ”
20543	20645	20348	20348	Catherine	73	“ Unsafe ! oh , lord ! what is there in that ? They will only get a roll if it does break down ; and there is plenty of dirt ; it will be excellent falling . Oh , curse it ! the carriage is safe enough , if a man knows how to drive it ; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn out . Lord bless you ! i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to York and back again , without losing a nail . ”
21245	21250	21239	21240	her friend	305	“ Past three o’clock ! ”
21499	21509	21513	21513	she	707	“ Well , my dear , here you are , ”
21523	21534	21513	21513	she	707	“ and I hope you have had a pleasant airing ? ”
21535	21553	21469	21469	she	707	“ Yes , ma’am , I thank you ; we could not have had a nicer day . ”
21554	21569	21513	21513	she	707	“ So Mrs. Thorpe said ; she was vastly pleased at your all going . ”
21570	21579	21469	21469	she	707	“ You have seen Mrs. Thorpe , then ? ”
21580	21634	21513	21513	she	707	“ Yes , I went to the pump - room as soon as you were gone , and there I met her , and we had a great deal of talk together . She says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning , it is so uncommonly scarce . ”
21635	21645	21469	21469	she	707	“ Did you see anybody else of our acquaintance ? ”
21646	21675	21513	21513	she	707	“ Yes ; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent , and there we met Mrs. Hughes , and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her . ”
21676	21688	21469	21469	she	707	“ Did you indeed ? And did they speak to you ? ”
21689	21748	21513	21513	she	707	“ Yes , we walked along the Crescent together for half an hour . They seem very agreeable people . Miss Tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin , and I fancy , by what I can learn , that she always dresses very handsomely . Mrs. Hughes talked to me a great deal about the family . ”
21749	21759	21469	21469	she	707	“ And what did she tell you of them ? ”
21760	21775	21513	21513	she	707	“ Oh ! a vast deal indeed ; she hardly talked of anything else . ”
21776	21789	21469	21469	she	707	“ Did she tell you what part of Gloucestershire they come from ? ”
21790	21876	21513	21513	she	707	“ Yes , she did ; but I can not recollect now . But they are very good kind of people , and very rich . Mrs. Tilney was a Miss Drummond , and she and Mrs. Hughes were schoolfellows ; and Miss Drummond had a very large fortune ; and , when she married , her father gave her twenty thousand pounds , and five hundred to buy wedding - clothes . Mrs. Hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse . ”
21877	21887	21469	21469	she	707	“ And are Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath ? ”
21888	21977	21513	21513	she	707	“ Yes , I fancy they are , but I am not quite certain . Upon recollection , however , I have a notion they are both dead ; at least the mother is ; yes , I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead , because Mrs. Hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter on her wedding - day and that Miss Tilney has got now , for they were put by for her when her mother died . ”
21978	21991	21469	21469	she	707	“ And is Mr. Tilney , my partner , the only son ? ”
21992	22035	21513	21513	she	707	“ I can not be quite positive about that , my dear ; I have some idea he is ; but , however , he is a very fine young man , Mrs. Hughes says , and likely to do very well . ”
22207	22223	22225	22225	her	735	“ Oh , heavens ! my beloved Catherine , have I got you at last ? ”
22238	22244	22246	22246	he	742	“ Now , Mr. Morland , ”
22256	22458	22246	22246	he	742	“ I shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening ; so I charge you not to expect it . My sweetest Catherine , how have you been this long age ? But I need not ask you , for you look delightfully . You really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever ; you mischievous creature , do you want to attract everybody ? I assure you , my brother is quite in love with you already ; and as for Mr. Tilney — but _ that _ is a settled thing — even _ your _ modesty can not doubt his attachment now ; his coming back to Bath makes it too plain . Oh ! what would not I give to see him ! I really am quite wild with impatience . My mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world ; she saw him this morning , you know ; you must introduce him to me . Is he in the house now ? Look about , for heaven ’s sake ! i assure you , I can hardly exist till I see him . ”
22459	22462	22464	22464	Catherine	73	“ No , ”
22466	22479	22464	22464	Catherine	73	“ he is not here ; I can not see him anywhere . ”
22480	22638	22246	22246	he	742	“ Oh , horrid ! am I never to be acquainted with him ? How do you like my gown ? I think it does not look amiss ; the sleeves were entirely my own thought . Do you know , I get so immoderately sick of Bath ; your brother and I were agreeing this morning that , though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks , we would not live here for millions . We soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place ; really , our opinions were so exactly the same , it was quite ridiculous ! there was not a single point in which we differed ; I would not have had you by for the world ; you are such a sly thing , I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it . ”
22639	22647	22464	22464	Catherine	73	“ No , indeed I should not . ”
22648	22715	22246	22246	he	742	“ Oh , yes you would indeed ; I know you better than you know yourself . You would have told us that we seemed born for each other , or some nonsense of that kind , which would have distressed me beyond conception ; my cheeks would have been as red as your roses ; I would not have had you by for the world . ”
22716	22750	22464	22464	Catherine	73	“ Indeed you do me injustice ; I would not have made so improper a remark upon any account ; and besides , I am sure it would never have entered my head . ”
23231	23238	23501	23502	Mrs. Hughes	125	“ How well your brother dances ! ”
23262	23265	23266	23266	she	101	“ Henry ! ”
23272	23281	23266	23266	she	101	“ Yes , he does dance very well . ”
23282	23321	23322	23323	Miss Tilney	90	“ He must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the other evening , when he saw me sitting down . But I really had been engaged the whole day to Mr. Thorpe . ”
23328	23334	23336	23336	Catherine	73	“ You can not think , ”
23343	23364	23336	23336	Catherine	73	“ how surprised I was to see him again . I felt so sure of his being quite gone away . ”
23365	23396	23322	23323	Miss Tilney	90	“ When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before , he was in Bath but for a couple of days . He came only to engage lodgings for us . ”
23397	23436	23336	23336	Catherine	73	“ _ That _ never occurred to me ; and of course , not seeing him anywhere , I thought he must be gone . Was not the young lady he danced with on Monday a Miss Smith ? ”
23437	23446	23322	23323	Miss Tilney	90	“ Yes , an acquaintance of Mrs. Hughes . ”
23447	23464	23336	23336	Catherine	73	“ I dare say she was very glad to dance . Do you think her pretty ? ”
23465	23469	23322	23323	Miss Tilney	90	“ Not very . ”
23470	23483	23336	23336	Catherine	73	“ He never comes to the pump - room , I suppose ? ”
23484	23500	23322	23323	Miss Tilney	90	“ Yes , sometimes ; but he has rid out this morning with my father . ”
23518	23532	23534	23534	Catherine	73	“ I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon , ”
23536	23548	23534	23534	Catherine	73	“ Shall you be at the cotillion ball to - morrow ? ”
23549	23561	23588	23589	Miss Tilney	90	“ Perhaps we — Yes , I think we certainly shall . ”
23562	23576	23534	23534	Catherine	73	“ I am glad of it , for we shall all be there . ”
24160	24170	24172	24172	Isabella	101	“ Do not be frightened , my dear Catherine , ”
24174	24243	24172	24172	Isabella	101	“ but I am really going to dance with your brother again . I declare positively it is quite shocking . I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself , but you and John must keep us in countenance . Make haste , my dear creature , and come to us . John is just walked off , but he will be back in a moment . ”
24464	24470	24472	24472	he	97	“ Heyday , Miss Morland ! ”
24474	24492	24472	24472	he	97	“ What is the meaning of this ? I thought you and I were to dance together . ”
24493	24507	24472	24472	he	97	“ I wonder you should think so , for you never asked me . ”
24508	24642	24472	24472	he	97	“ That is a good one , by Jove ! i asked you as soon as I came into the room , and I was just going to ask you again , but when I turned round , you were gone ! this is a cursed shabby trick ! i only came for the sake of dancing with _ you _ , and I firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since Monday . Yes ; I remember , I asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak . And here have I been telling all my acquaintance that I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room ; and when they see you standing up with somebody else , they will quiz me famously . ”
24643	24664	24472	24472	he	97	“ Oh , no ; they will never think of _ me _ , after such a description as that . ”
24665	24691	24692	24692	Catherine	73	“ By heavens , if they do not , I will kick them out of the room for blockheads . What chap have you there ? ”
24697	24700	24701	24701	he	73	“ Tilney , ”
24704	24868	24701	24701	he	73	“ Hum — I do not know him . A good figure of a man ; well put together . Does he want a horse ? Here is a friend of mine , Sam Fletcher , has got one to sell that would suit anybody . A famous clever animal for the road — only forty guineas . I had fifty minds to buy it myself , for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when I meet with one ; but it would not answer my purpose , it would not do for the field . I would give any money for a real good hunter . I have three now , the best that ever were backed . I would not take eight hundred guineas for them . Fletcher and I mean to get a house in Leicestershire , against the next season . It is so d — — uncomfortable , living at an inn . ”
24911	25040	24902	24903	Her partner	389	“ That gentleman would have put me out of patience , had he stayed with you half a minute longer . He has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me . We have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening , and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time . Nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one , without injuring the rights of the other . I consider a country - dance as an emblem of marriage . Fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both ; and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves , have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours . ”
25041	25050	24902	24902	Her	789	“ But they are such very different things ! ”
25051	25063	24902	24903	Her partner	389	“ — That you think they can not be compared together . ”
25064	25102	24902	24902	Her	789	“ To be sure not . People that marry can never part , but must go and keep house together . People that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour . ”
25103	25263	24902	24903	Her partner	389	“ And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing . Taken in that light certainly , their resemblance is not striking ; but I think I could place them in such a view . You will allow , that in both , man has the advantage of choice , woman only the power of refusal ; that in both , it is an engagement between man and woman , formed for the advantage of each ; and that when once entered into , they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution ; that it is their duty , each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere , and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours , or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else . You will allow all this ? ”
25264	25312	24902	24902	Her	789	“ Yes , to be sure , as you state it , all this sounds very well ; but still they are so very different . I can not look upon them at all in the same light , nor think the same duties belong to them . ”
25313	25416	24902	24903	Her partner	389	“ In one respect , there certainly is a difference . In marriage , the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman , the woman to make the home agreeable to the man ; he is to purvey , and she is to smile . But in dancing , their duties are exactly changed ; the agreeableness , the compliance are expected from him , while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water . _ That _ , I suppose , was the difference of duties which struck you , as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison . ”
25417	25428	24902	24902	Her	789	“ No , indeed , I never thought of that . ”
25429	25538	24902	24903	Her partner	389	“ Then I am quite at a loss . One thing , however , I must observe . This disposition on your side is rather alarming . You totally disallow any similarity in the obligations ; and may I not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish ? Have I not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return , or if any other gentleman were to address you , there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose ? ”
25539	25586	24902	24902	Her	789	“ Mr. Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother ’s , that if he talks to me , I must talk to him again ; but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that I have any acquaintance with . ”
25587	25601	24902	24903	Her partner	389	“ And is that to be my only security ? Alas , alas ! ”
25602	25648	24902	24902	Her	789	“ Nay , I am sure you can not have a better ; for if I do not know anybody , it is impossible for me to talk to them ; and , besides , I do not _ want _ to talk to anybody . ”
25649	25685	24902	24903	Her partner	389	“ Now you have given me a security worth having ; and I shall proceed with courage . Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had the honour of making the inquiry before ? ”
25686	25696	24902	24902	Her	789	“ Yes , quite — more so , indeed . ”
25697	25730	24902	24903	Her partner	389	“ More so ! take care , or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time . You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks . ”
25731	25750	24902	24902	Her	789	“ I do not think I should be tired , if I were to stay here six months . ”
25751	25839	24902	24903	Her partner	389	“ Bath , compared with London , has little variety , and so everybody finds out every year . ‘ For six weeks , I allow Bath is pleasant enough ; but beyond _ that _ , it is the most tiresome place in the world . ’ You would be told so by people of all descriptions , who come regularly every winter , lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve , and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer . ”
25840	25922	24902	24902	Her	789	“ Well , other people must judge for themselves , and those who go to London may think nothing of Bath . But I , who live in a small retired village in the country , can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home ; for here are a variety of amusements , a variety of things to be seen and done all day long , which I can know nothing of there . ”
25923	25932	24902	24903	Her partner	389	“ You are not fond of the country . ”
25933	25978	24902	24902	Her	789	“ Yes , I am . I have always lived there , and always been very happy . But certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a Bath life . One day in the country is exactly like another . ”
25979	25994	24902	24903	Her partner	389	“ But then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country . ”
25995	25999	24902	24902	Her	789	“ Do I ? ”
26000	26005	24902	24903	Her partner	389	“ Do you not ? ”
26006	26016	24902	24902	Her	789	“ I do not believe there is much difference . ”
26017	26030	24902	24903	Her partner	389	“ Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long . ”
26031	26084	24902	24902	Her	789	“ And so I am at home — only I do not find so much of it . I walk about here , and so I do there ; but here I see a variety of people in every street , and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen . ”
26092	26101	26102	26102	he	92	“ Only go and call on Mrs. Allen ! ”
26105	26147	26102	26102	he	92	“ What a picture of intellectual poverty ! however , when you sink into this abyss again , you will have more to say . You will be able to talk of Bath , and of all that you did here . ”
26148	26270	24902	24902	Her	789	“ Oh ! yes . I shall never be in want of something to talk of again to Mrs. Allen , or anybody else . I really believe I shall always be talking of Bath , when I am at home again — I _ do _ like it so very much . If I could but have Papa and Mamma , and the rest of them here , I suppose I should be too happy ! james ’s coming ( my eldest brother ) is quite delightful — and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already . Oh ! who can ever be tired of Bath ? ”
26271	26332	26102	26102	he	92	“ Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do . But papas and mammas , and brothers , and intimate friends are a good deal gone by , to most of the frequenters of Bath — and the honest relish of balls and plays , and everyday sights , is past with them . ”
26476	26512	26463	26464	the gentleman	382	“ I see that you guess what I have just been asked . That gentleman knows your name , and you have a right to know his . It is General Tilney , my father . ”
26518	26519	26513	26513	Catherine	73	“ Oh!”—but
26523	26526	26513	26513	Catherine	73	“ Oh ! ”
26565	26573	26575	26575	her	794	“ How handsome a family they are ! ”
26675	26681	26682	26682	she	794	“ I shall like it , ”
26685	26708	26682	26682	she	794	“ beyond anything in the world ; and do not let us put it off — let us go to - morrow . ”
26753	26759	26742	26742	they	804	“ Remember — twelve o’clock , ”
26962	26992	26954	26955	Mrs. Allen	86	“ She had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day , if the clouds would only go off , and the sun keep out . ”
27016	27029	27032	27032	her	794	“ Oh ! dear , I do believe it will be wet , ”
27039	27047	27049	27050	Mrs. Allen	86	“ I thought how it would be , ”
27052	27061	27063	27063	Catherine	73	“ No walk for me to - day , ”
27065	27082	27063	27063	Catherine	73	“ but perhaps it may come to nothing , or it may hold up before twelve . ”
27083	27100	27049	27050	Mrs. Allen	86	“ Perhaps it may , but then , my dear , it will be so dirty . ”
27101	27114	27063	27063	Catherine	73	“ Oh ! that will not signify ; I never mind dirt . ”
27115	27118	27049	27050	Mrs. Allen	86	“ No , ”
27125	27133	27049	27050	Mrs. Allen	86	“ I know you never mind dirt . ”
27139	27147	27149	27149	Catherine	73	“ It comes on faster and faster ! ”
27159	27177	27063	27063	Catherine	73	“ So it does indeed . If it keeps raining , the streets will be very wet . ”
27178	27195	27063	27063	Catherine	73	“ There are four umbrellas up already . How I hate the sight of an umbrella ! ”
27196	27215	27063	27063	Catherine	73	“ They are disagreeable things to carry . I would much rather take a chair at any time . ”
27216	27235	27063	27063	Catherine	73	“ It was such a nice - looking morning ! i felt so convinced it would be dry ! ”
27236	27313	27063	27063	Catherine	73	“ Anybody would have thought so indeed . There will be very few people in the pump - room , if it rains all the morning . I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes , but I dare say he will not , for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat ; I wonder he should dislike it , it must be so comfortable . ”
27368	27380	27324	27324	Catherine	73	“ You will not be able to go , my dear . ”
27381	27477	27324	27324	Catherine	73	“ I do not quite despair yet . I shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve . This is just the time of day for it to clear up , and I do think it looks a little lighter . There , it is twenty minutes after twelve , and now I _ shall _ give it up entirely . Oh ! that we had such weather here as they had at Udolpho , or at least in Tuscany and the south of France!—the night that poor St. Aubin died!—such beautiful weather ! ”
27570	27578	27567	27578	, who had “ always thought it would clear up . ”	2645	“ always thought it would clear up . ”
27672	27713	27714	27715	Mrs. Allen	86	“ Isabella , my brother , and Mr. Thorpe , I declare ! they are coming for me perhaps — but I shall not go — I can not go indeed , for you know Miss Tilney may still call . ”
27751	27758	27760	27760	he	97	“ Make haste ! make haste ! ”
27766	27795	27760	27760	he	97	“ Put on your hat this moment — there is no time to be lost — we are going to Bristol . How d’ye do , Mrs. Allen ? ”
27796	27834	27740	27740	he	97	“ To Bristol ! is not that a great way off ? But , however , I can not go with you to - day , because I am engaged ; I expect some friends every moment . ”
27869	28012	27858	27860	the two others	691	“ My sweetest Catherine , is not this delightful ? We shall have a most heavenly drive . You are to thank your brother and me for the scheme ; it darted into our heads at breakfast - time , I verily believe at the same instant ; and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain . But it does not signify , the nights are moonlight , and we shall do delightfully . Oh ! i am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet ! so much better than going to the Lower Rooms . We shall drive directly to Clifton and dine there ; and , as soon as dinner is over , if there is time for it , go on to Kingsweston . ”
28013	28024	28026	28026	Morland	73	“ I doubt our being able to do so much , ”
28028	28033	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ You croaking fellow ! ”
28037	28076	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ We shall be able to do ten times more . Kingsweston ! aye , and Blaize Castle too , and anything else we can hear of ; but here is your sister says she will not go . ”
28077	28081	28083	28083	Catherine	73	“ Blaize Castle ! ”
28085	28090	28083	28083	Catherine	73	“ What is that ? ”
28091	28108	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ The finest place in England — worth going fifty miles at any time to see . ”
28109	28122	28083	28083	Catherine	73	“ What , is it really a castle , an old castle ? ”
28123	28130	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ The oldest in the kingdom . ”
28131	28141	28083	28083	Catherine	73	“ But is it like what one reads of ? ”
28142	28149	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ Exactly — the very same . ”
28150	28162	28083	28083	Catherine	73	“ But now really — are there towers and long galleries ? ”
28163	28167	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ By dozens . ”
28168	28186	28083	28083	Catherine	73	“ Then I should like to see it ; but I cannot — I can not go . ”
28187	28200	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ Not go ! my beloved creature , what do you mean ? ”
28201	28207	28210	28210	she	816	“ I can not go , because”—looking
28217	28263	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	smile—“I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk . They promised to come at twelve , only it rained ; but now , as it is so fine , I dare say they will be here soon . ”
28264	28269	28271	28271	Thorpe	119	“ Not they indeed , ”
28273	28297	28271	28271	Thorpe	119	“ for , as we turned into Broad Street , I saw them — does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts ? ”
28298	28305	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ I do not know indeed . ”
28306	28334	28271	28271	Thorpe	119	“ Yes , I know he does ; I saw him . You are talking of the man you danced with last night , are not you ? ”
28335	28338	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ Yes . ”
28339	28361	28271	28271	Thorpe	119	“ Well , I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road , driving a smart - looking girl . ”
28362	28367	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ Did you indeed ? ”
28368	28391	28271	28271	Thorpe	119	“ Did upon my soul ; knew him again directly , and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too . ”
28392	28412	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ It is very odd ! but I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk . ”
28413	28459	28271	28271	Thorpe	119	“ And well they might , for I never saw so much dirt in my life . Walk ! You could no more walk than you could fly ! it has not been so dirty the whole winter ; it is ankle - deep everywhere . ”
28464	28492	28460	28460	Isabella	101	“ My dearest Catherine , you can not form an idea of the dirt ; come , you must go ; you can not refuse going now . ”
28493	28524	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ I should like to see the castle ; but may we go all over it ? May we go up every staircase , and into every suite of rooms ? ”
28525	28535	28460	28460	Isabella	101	“ Yes , yes , every hole and corner . ”
28536	28561	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ But then , if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer , and call by and by ? ”
28562	28600	28460	28460	Isabella	101	“ Make yourself easy , there is no danger of that , for I heard Tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback , that they were going as far as Wick Rocks . ”
28601	28613	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ Then I will . Shall I go , Mrs. Allen ? ”
28614	28623	28460	28460	Isabella	101	“ Just as you please , my dear . ”
28624	28635	28035	28035	Thorpe	119	“ Mrs. Allen , you must persuade her to go , ”
28649	28655	28657	28657	she	817	“ Well , my dear , ”
28659	28664	28657	28657	she	817	“ suppose you go . ”
28925	28941	28922	28923	her companion	569	“ Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by ? ”
28942	28947	28922	28923	her companion	569	“ Who ? Where ? ”
28948	28965	28922	28923	her companion	569	“ On the right - hand pavement — she must be almost out of sight now . ”
28995	29003	29004	29004	she	819	“ Stop , stop , Mr. Thorpe , ”
29008	29042	29004	29004	she	819	“ it is Miss Tilney ; it is indeed . How could you tell me they were gone ? Stop , stop , I will get out this moment and go to them . ”
29117	29146	29111	29111	she	819	“ Pray , pray stop , Mr. Thorpe . I can not go on . I will not go on . I must go back to Miss Tilney . ”
29205	29320	29321	29321	Thorpe	119	“ How could you deceive me so , Mr. Thorpe ? How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown Road ? I would not have had it happen so for the world . They must think it so strange , so rude of me ! to go by them , too , without saying a word ! you do not know how vexed I am ; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton , nor in anything else . I had rather , ten thousand times rather , get out now , and walk back to them . How could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton ? ”
29590	29679	29587	29587	Morland	73	“ We had better go back , Thorpe ; it is too late to go on to - day ; your sister thinks so as well as I. We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street , very little more than seven miles ; and , I suppose , we have at least eight more to go . It will never do . We set out a great deal too late . We had much better put it off till another day , and turn round . ”
29680	29688	29690	29690	Thorpe	119	“ It is all one to me , ”
29709	29725	29727	29727	he	119	“ If your brother had not got such a d — — beast to drive , ”
29731	29792	29727	29727	he	119	“ we might have done it very well . My horse would have trotted to Clifton within the hour , if left to himself , and I have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken - winded jade ’s pace . Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own . ”
29793	29800	29802	29802	Catherine	73	“ No , he is not , ”
29805	29816	29802	29802	Catherine	73	“ for I am sure he could not afford it . ”
29817	29826	29727	29727	he	119	“ And why can not he afford it ? ”
29827	29835	29802	29802	Catherine	73	“ Because he has not money enough . ”
29836	29843	29727	29727	he	119	“ And whose fault is that ? ”
29844	29853	29854	29854	Thorpe	119	“ Nobody ’s , that I know of . ”
30074	30101	30058	30059	Mr. Allen	83	“ I am glad your brother had so much sense ; I am glad you are come back . It was a strange , wild scheme . ”
30178	30333	30160	30160	Her	101	“ How I pity the poor creatures that are going there ! how glad I am that I am not amongst them ! i wonder whether it will be a full ball or not ! they have not begun dancing yet . I would not be there for all the world . It is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself . I dare say it will not be a very good ball . I know the Mitchells will not be there . I am sure I pity everybody that is . But I dare say , Mr. Morland , you long to be at it , do not you ? I am sure you do . Well , pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you . I dare say we could do very well without you ; but you men think yourselves of such consequence . ”
30373	30384	30385	30385	she	101	“ Do not be so dull , my dearest creature , ”
30388	30512	30385	30385	she	101	“ You will quite break my heart . It was amazingly shocking , to be sure ; but the Tilneys were entirely to blame . Why were not they more punctual ? It was dirty , indeed , but what did that signify ? I am sure John and I should not have minded it . I never mind going through anything , where a friend is concerned ; that is my disposition , and John is just the same ; he has amazing strong feelings . Good heavens ! what a delightful hand you have got ! kings , I vow ! i never was so happy in my life ! i would fifty times rather you should have them than myself . ”
30570	30574	30576	30576	Catherine	73	“ Mrs. Allen , ”
30581	30608	30576	30576	Catherine	73	“ will there be any harm in my calling on Miss Tilney to - day ? I shall not be easy till I have explained everything . ”
30609	30632	30576	30576	Catherine	73	“ Go , by all means , my dear ; only put on a white gown ; Miss Tilney always wears white . ”
31219	31223	31205	31205	she	779	“ quite horrid . ”
31631	31722	31625	31625	he	92	“ Oh ! mr . Tilney , I have been quite wild to speak to you , and make my apologies . You must have thought me so rude ; but indeed it was not my own fault , was it , Mrs. Allen ? Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together ? And then what could I do ? But I had ten thousand times rather have been with you ; now had not I , Mrs. Allen ? ”
31723	31732	31734	31735	Mrs. Allen	86	“ My dear , you tumble my gown , ”
31782	31817	31769	31769	he	892	“ We were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in Argyle Street : you were so kind as to look back on purpose . ”
31818	31901	31931	31931	he	92	“ But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk ; I never thought of such a thing ; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop ; I called out to him as soon as ever I saw you ; now , Mrs. Allen , did not — Oh ! you were not there ; but indeed I did ; and , if Mr. Thorpe would only have stopped , I would have jumped out and run after you . ”
31953	31965	31967	31967	Catherine	73	“ Oh , do not say Miss Tilney was not angry , ”
31969	32024	31967	31967	Catherine	73	“ because I know she was ; for she would not see me this morning when I called ; I saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it ; I was hurt , but I was not affronted . Perhaps you did not know I had been there . ”
32025	32137	31931	31931	he	92	“ I was not within at the time ; but I heard of it from Eleanor , and she has been wishing ever since to see you , to explain the reason of such incivility ; but perhaps I can do it as well . It was nothing more than that my father — they were just preparing to walk out , and he being hurried for time , and not caring to have it put off — made a point of her being denied . That was all , I do assure you . She was very much vexed , and meant to make her apology as soon as possible . ”
32174	32223	31931	31931	he	92	“ But , Mr. Tilney , why were _ you _ less generous than your sister ? If she felt such confidence in my good intentions , and could suppose it to be only a mistake , why should _ you _ be so ready to take offence ? ”
32224	32231	32282	32282	He	382	“ Me ! i take offence ! ”
32232	32253	31931	31931	he	92	“ Nay , I am sure by your look , when you came into the box , you were angry . ”
32254	32264	32282	32282	He	382	“ I angry ! i could have no right . ”
32265	32281	32282	32282	He	382	“ Well , nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face . ”
32475	32485	32492	32492	she	896	“ How came Mr. Thorpe to know your father ? ”
32593	32641	32590	32591	General Tilney	138	“ He is a fine old fellow , upon my soul ! stout , active — looks as young as his son . I have a great regard for him , I assure you : a gentleman - like , good sort of fellow as ever lived . ”
32642	32651	32861	32861	his	908	“ But how came you to know him ? ”
32652	32840	32590	32591	General Tilney	138	“ Know him ! there are few people much about town that I do not know . I have met him forever at the Bedford ; and I knew his face again to - day the moment he came into the billiard - room . One of the best players we have , by the by ; and we had a little touch together , though I was almost afraid of him at first : the odds were five to four against me ; and , if I had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world — I took his ball exactly — but I could not make you understand it without a table ; however , I _ did _ beat him . A very fine fellow ; as rich as a Jew . I should like to dine with him ; I dare say he gives famous dinners . But what do you think we have been talking of ? You . Yes , by heavens ! and the General thinks you the finest girl in Bath . ”
32841	32852	32861	32861	his	908	“ Oh ! nonsense ! how can you say so ? ”
32853	32860	32590	32591	General Tilney	138	“ And what do you think I said?”—lowering
32862	32877	32861	32861	his	908	voice—“well done , General , said I ; I am quite of your mind . ”
33360	33380	33352	33352	Catherine	73	“ Do not urge me , Isabella . I am engaged to Miss Tilney . I can not go . ”
33409	33442	33401	33401	they	913	“ It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement , and must only beg to put off the walk till Tuesday . ”
33443	33465	33467	33467	Isabella	101	“ No , it would not be easy . I could not do it . There has been no prior engagement . ”
33625	33722	33595	33595	she	101	“ I can not help being jealous , Catherine , when I see myself slighted for strangers , I , who love you so excessively ! when once my affections are placed , it is not in the power of anything to change them . But I believe my feelings are stronger than anybody ’s ; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace ; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick , I own . These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else . ”
33806	33847	33793	33793	Morland	73	“ Nay , Catherine . I think you can not stand out any longer now . The sacrifice is not much ; and to oblige such a friend — I shall think you quite unkind , if you still refuse . ”
33912	33919	33869	33869	she	101	“ No , no , no ! ”
33925	33946	33869	33869	she	101	“ that could not be , for Thorpe did not know that he might not go to town on Tuesday . ”
33978	34026	33967	33967	Isabella	101	“ Very well , then there is an end of the party . If Catherine does not go , I can not . I can not be the only woman . I would not , upon any account in the world , do so improper a thing . ”
34027	34034	34036	34036	James	103	“ Catherine , you must go , ”
34038	34063	33967	33967	Isabella	101	“ But why can not Mr. Thorpe drive one of his other sisters ? I dare say either of them would like to go . ”
34064	34068	34070	34070	Thorpe	119	“ Thank ye , ”
34072	34118	34070	34070	Thorpe	119	“ but I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about , and look like a fool . No , if you do not go , d — — me if I do . I only go for the sake of driving you . ”
34119	34130	34132	34132	her	923	“ That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure . ”
34214	34227	34229	34229	James	103	“ I did not think you had been so obstinate , Catherine , ”
34231	34256	34229	34229	James	103	“ you were not used to be so hard to persuade ; you once were the kindest , best - tempered of my sisters . ”
34257	34267	34268	34268	she	923	“ I hope I am not less so now , ”
34274	34297	34268	34268	she	923	“ but indeed I can not go . If I am wrong , I am doing what I believe to be right . ”
34298	34302	34304	34304	Isabella	101	“ I suspect , ”
34311	34318	34304	34304	Isabella	101	“ there is no great struggle . ”
34363	34398	34349	34349	Thorpe	101	“ Well , I have settled the matter , and now we may all go to - morrow with a safe conscience . I have been to Miss Tilney , and made your excuses . ”
34399	34404	34406	34406	Catherine	73	“ You have not ! ”
34408	34492	34349	34349	Thorpe	101	“ I have , upon my soul . Left her this moment . Told her you had sent me to say that , having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us to - morrow , you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till Tuesday . She said very well , Tuesday was just as convenient to her ; so there is an end of all our difficulties . A pretty good thought of mine — hey ? ”
34512	34545	34587	34587	Thorpe	101	“ A most heavenly thought indeed ! now , my sweet Catherine , all our distresses are over ; you are honourably acquitted , and we shall have a most delightful party . ”
34546	34552	34554	34554	Catherine	73	“ This will not do , ”
34556	34576	34554	34554	Catherine	73	“ I can not submit to this . I must run after Miss Tilney directly and set her right . ”
34638	34730	34614	34614	herself	90	“ I do not care . Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message . If I had thought it right to put it off , I could have spoken to Miss Tilney myself . This is only doing it in a ruder way ; and how do I know that Mr. Thorpe has — He may be mistaken again perhaps ; he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday . Let me go , Mr. Thorpe ; Isabella , do not hold me . ”
34768	34776	34778	34778	Catherine	73	“ Then I will go after them , ”
34780	34817	34778	34778	Catherine	73	“ wherever they are I will go after them . It does not signify talking . If I could not be persuaded into doing what I thought wrong , I never will be tricked into it . ”
34841	34855	34837	34837	Morland	73	“ Let her go , let her go , if she will go . ”
34856	34863	34864	34864	Thorpe	119	“ She is as obstinate as — ”
35234	35289	35207	35207	Her	101	“ I am come in a great hurry — It was all a mistake — I never promised to go — I told them from the first I could not go.—I ran away in a great hurry to explain it.—I did not care what you thought of me.—I would not stay for the servant . ”
35491	35510	35470	35470	he	182	“ What did William mean by it ? He should make a point of inquiring into the matter . ”
35673	35698	35699	35700	The General	800	“ Oh , no ; Catherine was sure they would not have the least objection , and she should have great pleasure in coming . ”
35941	35944	35946	35946	he	83	“ Well , ”
35948	35957	35946	35946	he	83	“ and do you think of going too ? ”
35958	35992	35910	35910	she	101	“ No ; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it ; and therefore you know I could not go with them , could I ? ”
35993	36104	35946	35946	he	83	“ No , certainly not ; and I am glad you do not think of it . These schemes are not at all the thing . Young men and women driving about the country in open carriages ! now and then it is very well ; but going to inns and public places together ! it is not right ; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should allow it . I am glad you do not think of going ; I am sure Mrs. Morland would not be pleased . Mrs. Allen , are not you of my way of thinking ? Do not you think these kind of projects objectionable ? ”
36105	36160	35910	35910	she	101	“ Yes , very much so indeed . Open carriages are nasty things . A clean gown is not five minutes ’ wear in them . You are splashed getting in and getting out ; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction . I hate an open carriage myself . ”
36161	36205	35946	35946	he	83	“ I know you do ; but that is not the question . Do not you think it has an odd appearance , if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men , to whom they are not even related ? ”
36206	36226	35910	35910	she	101	“ Yes , my dear , a very odd appearance indeed . I can not bear to see it . ”
36227	36231	36233	36233	Catherine	73	“ Dear madam , ”
36235	36286	36233	36233	Catherine	73	“ then why did not you tell me so before ? I am sure if I had known it to be improper , I would not have gone with Mr. Thorpe at all ; but I always hoped you would tell me , if you thought I was doing wrong . ”
36287	36379	35910	35910	she	101	“ And so I should , my dear , you may depend on it ; for as I told Mrs. Morland at parting , I would always do the best for you in my power . But one must not be over particular . Young people _ will _ be young people , as your good mother says herself . You know I wanted you , when we first came , not to buy that sprigged muslin , but you would . Young people do not like to be always thwarted . ”
36380	36403	36233	36233	Catherine	73	“ But this was something of real consequence ; and I do not think you would have found me hard to persuade . ”
36404	36419	36421	36422	Mr. Allen	83	“ As far as it has gone hitherto , there is no harm done , ”
36424	36445	36421	36422	Mr. Allen	83	“ and I would only advise you , my dear , not to go out with Mr. Thorpe any more . ”
36446	36457	36459	36460	his wife	337	“ That is just what I was going to say , ”
36550	36619	36537	36538	Mr. Allen	83	“ You had better leave her alone , my dear ; she is old enough to know what she is about , and if not , has a mother to advise her . Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt ; but , however , you had better not interfere . She and your brother choose to go , and you will be only getting ill will . ”
36878	36885	36887	36887	Catherine	73	“ I never look at it , ”
36899	36908	36887	36887	Catherine	73	“ without thinking of the south of France . ”
36909	36916	36918	36918	Henry	92	“ You have been abroad then ? ”
36924	36971	36887	36887	Catherine	73	“ Oh ! no , I only mean what I have read about . It always puts me in mind of the country that Emily and her father travelled through , in The Mysteries of Udolpho . But you never read novels , I dare say ? ”
36972	36976	36887	36887	Catherine	73	“ Why not ? ”
36977	36992	36887	36887	Catherine	73	“ Because they are not clever enough for you — gentlemen read better books . ”
36993	37070	36887	36887	Catherine	73	“ The person , be it gentleman or lady , who has not pleasure in a good novel , must be intolerably stupid . I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe ’s works , and most of them with great pleasure . The Mysteries of Udolpho , when I had once begun it , I could not lay down again ; I remember finishing it in two days — my hair standing on end the whole time . ”
37071	37074	37076	37077	Miss Tilney	90	“ Yes , ”
37079	37136	37076	37077	Miss Tilney	90	“ and I remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me , and that when I was called away for only five minutes to answer a note , instead of waiting for me , you took the volume into the Hermitage Walk , and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it . ”
37137	37246	36887	36887	Catherine	73	“ Thank you , Eleanor — a most honourable testimony . You see , Miss Morland , the injustice of your suspicions . Here was I , in my eagerness to get on , refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister , breaking the promise I had made of reading it aloud , and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part , by running away with the volume , which , you are to observe , was her own , particularly her own . I am proud when I reflect on it , and I think it must establish me in your good opinion . ”
37247	37281	37076	37077	Miss Tilney	90	“ I am very glad to hear it indeed , and now I shall never be ashamed of liking Udolpho myself . But I really thought before , young men despised novels amazingly . ”
37282	37435	36887	36887	Catherine	73	“ It is _ amazingly ; _ it may well suggest _ amazement _ if they do — for they read nearly as many as women . I myself have read hundreds and hundreds . Do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of Julias and Louisas . If we proceed to particulars , and engage in the never - ceasing inquiry of ‘ Have you read this ? ’ and ‘ Have you read that ? ’ I shall soon leave you as far behind me as — what shall I say?—I want an appropriate simile.—as far as your friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt when she went with her aunt into Italy . Consider how many years I have had the start of you . I had entered on my studies at Oxford , while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home ! ”
37436	37461	37076	37077	Miss Tilney	90	“ Not very good , I am afraid . But now really , do not you think Udolpho the nicest book in the world ? ”
37462	37482	36887	36887	Catherine	73	“ The nicest — by which I suppose you mean the neatest . That must depend upon the binding . ”
37483	37486	37488	37489	Miss Tilney	90	“ Henry , ”
37491	37580	37488	37489	Miss Tilney	90	“ you are very impertinent . Miss Morland , he is treating you exactly as he does his sister . He is forever finding fault with me , for some incorrectness of language , and now he is taking the same liberty with you . The word ‘ nicest , ’ as you used it , did not suit him ; and you had better change it as soon as you can , or we shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way . ”
37581	37586	37588	37588	Catherine	73	“ I am sure , ”
37590	37618	37588	37588	Catherine	73	“ I did not mean to say anything wrong ; but it _ is _ a nice book , and why should not I call it so ? ”
37619	37623	37625	37625	Henry	92	“ Very true , ”
37627	37715	37625	37625	Henry	92	“ and this is a very nice day , and we are taking a very nice walk , and you are two very nice young ladies . Oh ! it is a very nice word indeed ! it does for everything . Originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness , propriety , delicacy , or refinement — people were nice in their dress , in their sentiments , or their choice . But now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word . ”
37716	37722	37724	37725	his sister	2288	“ While , in fact , ”
37727	37798	37724	37725	his sister	2288	“ it ought only to be applied to you , without any commendation at all . You are more nice than wise . Come , Miss Morland , let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction , while we praise Udolpho in whatever terms we like best . It is a most interesting work . You are fond of that kind of reading ? ”
37799	37813	37588	37588	Catherine	73	“ To say the truth , I do not much like any other . ”
37814	37817	37724	37725	his sister	2288	“ Indeed ! ”
37818	37858	37588	37588	Catherine	73	“ That is , I can read poetry and plays , and things of that sort , and do not dislike travels . But history , real solemn history , I can not be interested in . Can you ? ”
37859	37868	37724	37725	his sister	2288	“ Yes , I am fond of history . ”
37869	37994	37588	37588	Catherine	73	“ I wish I were too . I read it a little as a duty , but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me . The quarrels of popes and kings , with wars or pestilences , in every page ; the men all so good for nothing , and hardly any women at all — it is very tiresome : and yet I often think it odd that it should be so dull , for a great deal of it must be invention . The speeches that are put into the heroes ’ mouths , their thoughts and designs — the chief of all this must be invention , and invention is what delights me in other books . ”
37995	38001	38003	38004	Miss Tilney	90	“ Historians , you think , ”
38006	38154	38003	38004	Miss Tilney	90	“ are not happy in their flights of fancy . They display imagination without raising interest . I am fond of history — and am very well contented to take the false with the true . In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records , which may be as much depended on , I conclude , as anything that does not actually pass under one ’s own observation ; and as for the little embellishments you speak of , they are embellishments , and I like them as such . If a speech be well drawn up , I read it with pleasure , by whomsoever it may be made — and probably with much greater , if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson , than if the genuine words of Caractacus , Agricola , or Alfred the Great . ”
38155	38302	37588	37588	Catherine	73	“ You are fond of history ! and so are Mr. Allen and my father ; and I have two brothers who do not dislike it . So many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable ! at this rate , I shall not pity the writers of history any longer . If people like to read their books , it is all very well , but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes , which , as I used to think , nobody would willingly ever look into , to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls , always struck me as a hard fate ; and though I know it is all very right and necessary , I have often wondered at the person ’s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it . ”
38303	38313	38315	38315	Henry	92	“ That little boys and girls should be tormented , ”
38317	38423	38315	38315	Henry	92	“ is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny ; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians , I must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim , and that by their method and style , they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life . I use the verb ‘ to torment , ’ as I observed to be your own method , instead of ‘ to instruct , ’ supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous . ”
38424	38527	37588	37588	Catherine	73	“ You think me foolish to call instruction a torment , but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell , if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together , and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it , as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home , you would allow that to _ torment _ and to _ instruct _ might sometimes be used as synonymous words . ”
38528	38632	38315	38315	Henry	92	“ Very probably . But historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read ; and even you yourself , who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe , very intense application , may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth - while to be tormented for two or three years of one ’s life , for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it . Consider — if reading had not been taught , Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain — or perhaps might not have written at all . ”
39272	39288	39256	39256	Catherine	73	“ I have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in London . ”
39306	39314	39289	39290	Miss Tilney	90	“ Indeed ! and of what nature ? ”
39315	39347	39481	39481	He	92	“ That I do not know , nor who is the author . I have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet . ”
39348	39361	39289	39290	Miss Tilney	90	“ Good heaven ! where could you hear of such a thing ? ”
39362	39397	39481	39481	He	92	“ A particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from London yesterday . It is to be uncommonly dreadful . I shall expect murder and everything of the kind . ”
39398	39440	39289	39290	Miss Tilney	90	“ You speak with astonishing composure ! but I hope your friend ’s accounts have been exaggerated ; and if such a design is known beforehand , proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect . ”
39441	39444	39446	39446	Henry	92	“ Government , ”
39453	39476	39446	39446	Henry	92	“ neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters . There must be murder ; and government cares not how much . ”
39487	39594	39481	39481	He	92	“ Come , shall I make you understand each other , or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can ? No — I will be noble . I will prove myself a man , no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head . I have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours . Perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute — neither vigorous nor keen . Perhaps they may want observation , discernment , judgment , fire , genius , and wit . ”
39595	39619	39289	39290	Miss Tilney	90	“ Miss Morland , do not mind what he says ; but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot . ”
39620	39626	39481	39481	He	92	“ Riot ! what riot ? ”
39627	39866	39289	39290	Miss Tilney	90	“ My dear Eleanor , the riot is only in your own brain . The confusion there is scandalous . Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out , in three duodecimo volumes , two hundred and seventy - six pages in each , with a frontispiece to the first , of two tombstones and a lantern — do you understand ? And you , Miss Morland — my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions . You talked of expected horrors in London — and instead of instantly conceiving , as any rational creature would have done , that such words could relate only to a circulating library , she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George ’s Fields , the Bank attacked , the Tower threatened , the streets of London flowing with blood , a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons ( the hopes of the nation ) called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents , and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney , in the moment of charging at the head of his troop , knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window . Forgive her stupidity . The fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman ; but she is by no means a simpleton in general . ”
39871	39877	39879	39880	Miss Tilney	90	“ And now , Henry , ”
39882	39938	39879	39880	Miss Tilney	90	“ that you have made us understand each other , you may as well make Miss Morland understand yourself — unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister , and a great brute in your opinion of women in general . Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways . ”
39939	39953	39289	39290	Miss Tilney	90	“ I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them . ”
39954	39967	39879	39880	Miss Tilney	90	“ No doubt ; but that is no explanation of the present . ”
39968	39975	39289	39290	Miss Tilney	90	“ What am I to do ? ”
39976	40005	39879	39880	Miss Tilney	90	“ You know what you ought to do . Clear your character handsomely before her . Tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women . ”
40006	40043	39289	39290	Miss Tilney	90	“ Miss Morland , I think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world — especially of those — whoever they may be — with whom I happen to be in company . ”
40044	40054	39879	39880	Miss Tilney	90	“ That is not enough . Be more serious . ”
40055	40096	39289	39290	Miss Tilney	90	“ Miss Morland , no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than I do . In my opinion , nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half . ”
40097	40154	39879	39880	Miss Tilney	90	“ We shall get nothing more serious from him now , Miss Morland . He is not in a sober mood . But I do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood , if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all , or an unkind one of me . ”
40459	40468	40470	40471	Miss Anne	155	“ They set off at eight this morning , ”
40473	40537	40470	40471	Miss Anne	155	“ and I am sure I do not envy them their drive . I think you and I are very well off to be out of the scrape . It must be the dullest thing in the world , for there is not a soul at Clifton at this time of year . Belle went with your brother , and John drove Maria . ”
40553	40558	40560	40561	the other	412	“ Oh ! yes , ”
40563	40616	40560	40561	the other	412	“ Maria is gone . She was quite wild to go . She thought it would be something very fine . I can not say I admire her taste ; and for my part , I was determined from the first not to go , if they pressed me ever so much . ”
40630	40649	40617	40617	Catherine	73	“ I wish you could have gone too . It is a pity you could not all go . ”
40650	40689	40560	40561	the other	412	“ Thank you ; but it is quite a matter of indifference to me . Indeed , I would not have gone on any account . I was saying so to Emily and Sophia when you overtook us . ”
41098	41179	41086	41086	she	156	“ She will never forgive me , I am sure ; but , you know , how could I help it ? John would have me go , for he vowed he would not drive her , because she had such thick ankles . I dare say she will not be in good humour again this month ; but I am determined I will not be cross ; it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper . ”
41223	41255	41215	41215	Isabella	101	“ Yes , my dear Catherine , it is so indeed ; your penetration has not deceived you . Oh , that arch eye of yours ! it sees through everything . ”
41266	41275	41277	41278	the other	412	“ Nay , my beloved , sweetest friend , ”
41280	41383	41277	41278	the other	412	“ compose yourself . I am amazingly agitated , as you perceive . Let us sit down and talk in comfort . Well , and so you guessed it the moment you had my note ? Sly creature ! oh ! my dear Catherine , you alone , who know my heart , can judge of my present happiness . Your brother is the most charming of men . I only wish I were more worthy of him . But what will your excellent father and mother say ? Oh ! heavens ! when I think of them I am so agitated ! ”
41418	41443	41414	41414	she	1030	“ Good heaven ! my dear Isabella , what do you mean ? Can you — can you really be in love with James ? ”
41643	41683	41635	41635	Isabella	101	“ You will be so infinitely dearer to me , my Catherine , than either Anne or Maria : I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland ’s family than to my own . ”
41693	41702	41704	41704	Isabella	101	“ You are so like your dear brother , ”
41706	41801	41704	41704	Isabella	101	“ that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you . But so it always is with me ; the first moment settles everything . The very first day that Morland came to us last Christmas — the very first moment I beheld him — my heart was irrecoverably gone . I remember I wore my yellow gown , with my hair done up in braids ; and when I came into the drawing - room , and John introduced him , I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before . ”
41837	41981	41827	41827	she	1037	“ I remember too , Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening , and wore her puce - coloured sarsenet ; and she looked so heavenly that I thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her ; I could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it . Oh ! catherine , the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother ’s account ! i would not have you suffer half what I have done ! i am grown wretchedly thin , I know ; but I will not pain you by describing my anxiety ; you have seen enough of it . I feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually — so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church ! but my secret I was always sure would be safe with _ you _ . ”
42093	42098	42100	42100	she	1039	“ It is impossible , ”
42102	42128	42100	42100	she	1039	“ for parents to be more kind , or more desirous of their children ’s happiness ; I have no doubt of their consenting immediately . ”
42129	42136	42138	42138	Isabella	101	“ Morland says exactly the same , ”
42140	42171	42138	42138	Isabella	101	“ and yet I dare not expect it ; my fortune will be so small ; they never can consent to it . Your brother , who might marry anybody ! ”
42181	42201	42100	42100	she	1039	“ Indeed , Isabella , you are too humble . The difference of fortune can be nothing to signify . ”
42202	42270	42323	42323	her	1046	“ Oh ! my sweet Catherine , in _ your _ generous heart I know it would signify nothing ; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many . As for myself , I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed . Had I the command of millions , were I mistress of the whole world , your brother would be my only choice . ”
42313	42321	42323	42323	her	1046	“ I am sure they will consent , ”
42327	42338	42323	42323	her	1046	“ I am sure they will be delighted with you . ”
42339	42345	42347	42347	Isabella	101	“ For my own part , ”
42349	42411	42347	42347	Isabella	101	“ my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me . Where people are really attached , poverty itself is wealth ; grandeur I detest : I would not settle in London for the universe . A cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy . There are some charming little villas about Richmond . ”
42412	42415	42417	42417	Catherine	73	“ Richmond ! ”
42419	42432	42417	42417	Catherine	73	“ You must settle near Fullerton . You must be near us . ”
42433	42532	42347	42347	Isabella	101	“ I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not . If I can but be near _ you _ , I shall be satisfied . But this is idle talking ! i will not allow myself to think of such things , till we have your father ’s answer . Morland says that by sending it to - night to Salisbury , we may have it to - morrow . To - morrow ? I know I shall never have courage to open the letter . I know it will be the death of me . ”
42692	42742	42678	42678	he	103	“ Indeed , Morland , I must drive you away . Consider how far you have to ride . I can not bear to see you linger so . For heaven ’s sake , waste no more time . There , go , go — I insist on it . ”
42897	42901	42866	42866	she	96	“ I know what ”
43022	43053	43076	43076	Isabella	101	“ I have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents , and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness , ”
43146	43149	43137	43137	Her	96	“ dear John ”
43151	43154	43137	43137	Her	96	“ dear Catherine ”
43159	43165	43137	43137	Her	96	“ dear Anne and dear Maria ”
43177	43179	43176	43179	two “ dears ”	2888	“ dears ”
43447	43453	43455	43455	he	97	“ Well , Miss Morland , ”
43465	43476	43455	43455	he	97	“ I am come to bid you good - bye . ”
43510	43519	43521	43521	Catherine	73	“ Shall not you be late at Devizes ? ”
43538	43581	43523	43523	He	97	“ A famous good thing this marrying scheme , upon my soul ! a clever fancy of Morland ’s and Belle ’s . What do you think of it , Miss Morland ? _ I _ say it is no bad notion . ”
43582	43594	43523	43523	He	97	“ I am sure I think it a very good one . ”
43595	43650	43523	43523	He	97	“ Do you ? That ’s honest , by heavens ! i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony , however . Did you ever hear the old song , ‘ Going to One Wedding Brings on Another ? ’ I say , you will come to Belle ’s wedding , I hope . ”
43651	43667	43523	43523	He	97	“ Yes ; I have promised your sister to be with her , if possible . ”
43668	43672	43523	43523	He	97	“ And then you know”—twisting
43679	43697	43523	43523	He	97	laugh—“I say , then you know , we may try the truth of this same old song . ”
43698	43732	43523	43523	He	97	“ May we ? But I never sing . Well , I wish you a good journey . I dine with Miss Tilney to - day , and must now be going home . ”
43733	43779	43523	43523	He	97	“ Nay , but there is no such confounded hurry . Who knows when we may be together again ? Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a fortnight , and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me . ”
43780	43790	43792	43792	Catherine	73	“ Then why do you stay away so long ? ”
43802	43887	43523	43523	He	97	“ That is kind of you , however — kind and good - natured . I shall not forget it in a hurry . But you have more good nature and all that , than anybody living , I believe . A monstrous deal of good nature , and it is not only good nature , but you have so much , so much of everything ; and then you have such — upon my soul , I do not know anybody like you . ”
43888	43917	43523	43523	He	97	“ Oh ! dear , there are a great many people like me , I dare say , only a great deal better . Good morning to you . ”
43918	43944	43523	43523	He	97	“ But I say , Miss Morland , I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton before it is long , if not disagreeable . ”
43945	43961	43523	43523	He	97	“ Pray do . My father and mother will be very glad to see you . ”
43962	43984	43523	43523	He	97	“ And I hope — I hope , Miss Morland , _ you _ will not be sorry to see me . ”
43985	44010	43523	43523	He	97	“ Oh ! dear , not at all . There are very few people I am sorry to see . Company is always cheerful . ”
44011	44094	43523	43523	He	97	“ That is just my way of thinking . Give me but a little cheerful company , let me only have the company of the people I love , let me only be where I like and with whom I like , and the devil take the rest , say I. And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same . But I have a notion , Miss Morland , you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters . ”
44095	44135	43523	43523	He	97	“ Perhaps we may ; but it is more than I ever thought of . And as to _ most matters _ , to say the truth , there are not many that I know my own mind about . ”
44136	44227	43523	43523	He	97	“ By Jove , no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me . My notion of things is simple enough . Let me only have the girl I like , say I , with a comfortable house over my head , and what care I for all the rest ? Fortune is nothing . I am sure of a good income of my own ; and if she had not a penny , why , so much the better . ”
44228	44316	43523	43523	He	97	“ Very true . I think like you there . If there is a good fortune on one side , there can be no occasion for any on the other . No matter which has it , so that there is enough . I hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another . And to marry for money I think the wickedest thing in existence . Good day . We shall be very glad to see you at Fullerton , whenever it is convenient . ”
44905	44981	44890	44890	Isabella	101	“ It was all pride , pride , insufferable haughtiness and pride ! she had long suspected the family to be very high , and this made it certain . Such insolence of behaviour as Miss Tilney ’s she had never heard of in her life ! not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding ! to behave to her guest with such superciliousness ! hardly even to speak to her ! ”
44982	45004	44890	44890	Isabella	101	“ But it was not so bad as that , Isabella ; there was no superciliousness ; she was very civil . ”
45005	45052	44890	44890	Isabella	101	“ Oh , do n’t defend her ! and then the brother , he , who had appeared so attached to you ! good heavens ! well , some people ’s feelings are incomprehensible . And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day ? ”
45053	45069	44890	44890	Isabella	101	“ I do not say so ; but he did not seem in good spirits . ”
45070	45107	44890	44890	Isabella	101	“ How contemptible ! of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion . Let me entreat you never to think of him again , my dear Catherine ; indeed he is unworthy of you . ”
45108	45121	44890	44890	Isabella	101	“ Unworthy ! i do not suppose he ever thinks of me . ”
45122	45160	44890	44890	Isabella	101	“ That is exactly what I say ; he never thinks of you . Such fickleness ! Oh ! how different to your brother and to mine ! i really believe John has the most constant heart . ”
45161	45201	44890	44890	Isabella	101	“ But as for General Tilney , I assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention ; it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy . ”
45202	45243	44890	44890	Isabella	101	“ Oh ! i know no harm of him ; I do not suspect him of pride . I believe he is a very gentleman - like man . John thinks very well of him , and John ’s judgment — ”
45244	45266	44890	44890	Isabella	101	“ Well , I shall see how they behave to me this evening ; we shall meet them at the rooms . ”
45267	45273	44890	44890	Isabella	101	“ And must I go ? ”
45274	45288	44890	44890	Isabella	101	“ Do not you intend it ? I thought it was all settled . ”
45289	45405	44890	44890	Isabella	101	“ Nay , since you make such a point of it , I can refuse you nothing . But do not insist upon my being very agreeable , for my heart , you know , will be some forty miles off . And as for dancing , do not mention it , I beg ; _ that _ is quite out of the question . Charles Hodges will plague me to death , I dare say ; but I shall cut him very short . Ten to one but he guesses the reason , and that is exactly what I want to avoid , so I shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself . ”
45982	45993	45995	45995	she	101	“ Your brother will not mind it , I know , ”
45997	46058	45995	45995	she	101	“ because I heard him say before that he hated dancing ; but it was very good - natured in him to think of it . I suppose he saw Isabella sitting down , and fancied she might wish for a partner ; but he is quite mistaken , for she would not dance upon any account in the world . ”
46065	46084	46059	46059	Henry	92	“ How very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people ’s actions . ”
46085	46093	46059	46059	Henry	92	“ Why ? What do you mean ? ”
46094	46161	46059	46059	Henry	92	“ With you , it is not , How is such a one likely to be influenced , What is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person ’s feelings , age , situation , and probable habits of life considered — but , How should _ I _ be influenced , What would be _ my _ inducement in acting so and so ? ”
46162	46169	46059	46059	Henry	92	“ I do not understand you . ”
46170	46186	46059	46059	Henry	92	“ Then we are on very unequal terms , for I understand you perfectly well . ”
46187	46202	46059	46059	Henry	92	“ Me ? Yes ; I can not speak well enough to be unintelligible . ”
46203	46213	46059	46059	Henry	92	“ Bravo ! an excellent satire on modern language . ”
46214	46223	46059	46059	Henry	92	“ But pray tell me what you mean . ”
46224	46263	46059	46059	Henry	92	“ Shall I indeed ? Do you really desire it ? But you are not aware of the consequences ; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment , and certainly bring on a disagreement between us . ”
46264	46280	46059	46059	Henry	92	“ No , no ; it shall not do either ; I am not afraid . ”
46281	46323	46059	46059	Henry	92	“ Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ”
46457	46475	46445	46445	she	1119	“ I can not think how it could happen ! isabella was so determined not to dance . ”
46476	46486	46445	46445	she	1119	“ And did Isabella never change her mind before ? ”
46487	46516	46445	46445	she	1119	“ Oh ! but , because — And your brother ! after what you told him from me , how could he think of going to ask her ? ”
46517	46596	46445	46445	she	1119	“ I can not take surprise to myself on that head . You bid me be surprised on your friend ’s account , and therefore I am ; but as for my brother , his conduct in the business , I must own , has been no more than I believed him perfectly equal to . The fairness of your friend was an open attraction ; her firmness , you know , could only be understood by yourself . ”
46597	46615	46445	46445	she	1119	“ You are laughing ; but , I assure you , Isabella is very firm in general . ”
46616	46675	46445	46445	she	1119	“ It is as much as should be said of anyone . To be always firm must be to be often obstinate . When properly to relax is the trial of judgment ; and , without reference to my brother , I really think Miss Thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour . ”
46713	46757	46708	46708	Isabella	101	“ I do not wonder at your surprise ; and I am really fatigued to death . He is such a rattle ! amusing enough , if my mind had been disengaged ; but I would have given the world to sit still . ”
46758	46765	46445	46445	she	1119	“ Then why did not you ? ”
46766	47006	46708	46708	Isabella	101	“ Oh ! my dear ! it would have looked so particular ; and you know how I abhor doing that . I refused him as long as I possibly could , but he would take no denial . You have no idea how he pressed me . I begged him to excuse me , and get some other partner — but no , not he ; after aspiring to my hand , there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of ; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance , he wanted to be with me . Oh ! such nonsense ! i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me ; for , of all things in the world , I hated fine speeches and compliments ; and so — and so then I found there would be no peace if I did not stand up . Besides , I thought Mrs. Hughes , who introduced him , might take it ill if I did not : and your dear brother , I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening . I am so glad it is over ! my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense : and then , being such a smart young fellow , I saw every eye was upon us . ”
47007	47014	46445	46445	she	1119	“ He is very handsome indeed . ”
47015	47087	46708	46708	Isabella	101	“ Handsome ! yes , I suppose he may . I dare say people would admire him in general ; but he is not at all in my style of beauty . I hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man . However , he is very well . Amazingly conceited , I am sure . I took him down several times , you know , in my way . ”
47286	47293	47295	47295	Isabella	101	“ It is very charming indeed , ”
47302	47311	47313	47316	the gentle Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ Mr. Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed , ”
47324	47415	47313	47316	the gentle Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ I only wish I could do as much . One could not expect more from him , you know . If he finds he _ can _ do more by and by , I dare say he will , for I am sure he must be an excellent good - hearted man . Four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed , but your wishes , my dear Isabella , are so moderate , you do not consider how little you ever want , my dear . ”
47416	47476	47313	47316	the gentle Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ It is not on my own account I wish for more ; but I can not bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland , making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life . For myself , it is nothing ; I never think of myself . ”
47477	47617	47313	47316	the gentle Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ I know you never do , my dear ; and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you . There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you ; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you , my dear child — but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things . Mr. Morland has behaved so very handsome , you know . I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ”
47618	47658	47313	47316	the gentle Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do , I am sure . But everybody has their failing , you know , and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money . ”
47666	47672	47674	47674	she	1134	“ I am very sure , ”
47676	47691	47674	47674	she	1134	“ that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford . ”
47696	47816	47694	47694	herself	101	“ As to that , my sweet Catherine , there can not be a doubt , and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me . It is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits ; I hate money ; and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year , I should not have a wish unsatisfied . Ah ! my Catherine , you have found me out . There ’s the sting . The long , long , endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living . ”
47817	47826	47828	47829	Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ Yes , yes , my darling Isabella , ”
47831	47865	47828	47829	Mrs. Thorpe	96	“ we perfectly see into your heart . You have no disguise . We perfectly understand the present vexation ; and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection . ”
48082	48085	48094	48094	him	103	“ perhaps , ”
48249	48257	48241	48241	she	1135	“ By the end of another week ! ”
48258	48311	48241	48241	she	1135	“ Yes , my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what I think a fair trial . He has been disappointed of some friends ’ arrival whom he expected to meet here , and as he is now pretty well , is in a hurry to get home . ”
48312	48320	48322	48322	Catherine	73	“ I am very sorry for it , ”
48325	48333	48322	48322	Catherine	73	“ if I had known this before — ”
48334	48337	48339	48340	Miss Tilney	90	“ Perhaps , ”
48346	48361	48339	48340	Miss Tilney	90	“ you would be so good — it would make me very happy if — ”
48404	48424	48396	48396	he	182	“ Well , Eleanor , may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend ? ”
48425	48442	48396	48396	he	182	“ I was just beginning to make the request , sir , as you came in . ”
48443	48467	48468	48468	he	182	“ Well , proceed by all means . I know how much your heart is in it . My daughter , Miss Morland , ”
48479	48719	48468	48468	he	182	“ has been forming a very bold wish . We leave Bath , as she has perhaps told you , on Saturday se’nnight . A letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home ; and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the Marquis of Longtown and General Courteney here , some of my very old friends , there is nothing to detain me longer in Bath . And could we carry our selfish point with you , we should leave it without a single regret . Can you , in short , be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company in Gloucestershire ? I am almost ashamed to make the request , though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in Bath than yourself . Modesty such as yours — but not for the world would I pain it by open praise . If you can be induced to honour us with a visit , you will make us happy beyond expression . ’ Tis true , we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place ; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour , for our mode of living , as you see , is plain and unpretending ; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable . ”
48811	48818	48820	48820	she	1144	“ I will write home directly , ”
48822	48838	48820	48820	she	1144	“ and if they do not object , as I dare say they will not — ”
48865	48875	48877	48877	he	138	“ Since they can consent to part with you , ”
48879	48889	48877	48877	he	138	“ we may expect philosophy from all the world . ”
49687	49694	49696	49696	she	1149	“ This is my favourite place , ”
49719	49728	49696	49696	she	1149	“ it is so out of the way . ”
49780	49794	50248	50248	Catherine	73	“ Do not be uneasy , Isabella , James will soon be here . ”
49795	49802	49803	49803	she	1149	“ Psha ! my dear creature , ”
49806	49884	49803	49803	she	1149	“ do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow . It would be hideous to be always together ; we should be the jest of the place . And so you are going to Northanger ! i am amazingly glad of it . It is one of the finest old places in England , I understand . I shall depend upon a most particular description of it . ”
49885	49910	50248	50248	Catherine	73	“ You shall certainly have the best in my power to give . But who are you looking for ? Are your sisters coming ? ”
49911	49979	49803	49803	she	1149	“ I am not looking for anybody . One ’s eyes must be somewhere , and you know what a foolish trick I have of fixing mine , when my thoughts are an hundred miles off . I am amazingly absent ; I believe I am the most absent creature in the world . Tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp . ”
49980	49996	50248	50248	Catherine	73	“ But I thought , Isabella , you had something in particular to tell me ? ”
49997	50049	49803	49803	she	1149	“ Oh yes , and so I have . But here is a proof of what I was saying . My poor head , I had quite forgot it . Well , the thing is this : I have just had a letter from John ; you can guess the contents . ”
50050	50059	50248	50248	Catherine	73	“ No , indeed , I can not . ”
50060	50094	49803	49803	she	1149	“ My sweet love , do not be so abominably affected . What can he write about , but yourself ? You know he is over head and ears in love with you . ”
50095	50104	50248	50248	Catherine	73	“ With _ me _ , dear Isabella ! ”
50105	50247	49803	49803	she	1149	“ Nay , my sweetest Catherine , this is being quite absurd ! modesty , and all that , is very well in its way , but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming . I have no idea of being so overstrained ! it is fishing for compliments . His attentions were such as a child must have noticed . And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement . He says so in this letter , says that he as good as made you an offer , and that you received his advances in the kindest way ; and now he wants me to urge his suit , and say all manner of pretty things to you . So it is in vain to affect ignorance . ”
50294	50423	50286	50286	her	1187	“ As to any attentions on his side , I do declare , upon my honour , I never was sensible of them for a moment — except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming . And as to making me an offer , or anything like it , there must be some unaccountable mistake . I could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind , you know ! and , as I ever wish to be believed , I solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us . The last half hour before he went away ! it must be all and completely a mistake — for I did not see him once that whole morning . ”
50424	50476	49803	49803	she	1149	“ But _ that _ you certainly did , for you spent the whole morning in Edgar ’s Buildings — it was the day your father ’s consent came — and I am pretty sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house . ”
50477	50701	50702	50702	Isabella	101	“ Are you ? Well , if you say it , it was so , I dare say — but for the life of me , I can not recollect it . I _ do _ remember now being with you , and seeing him as well as the rest — but that we were ever alone for five minutes — However , it is not worth arguing about , for whatever might pass on his side , you must be convinced , by my having no recollection of it , that I never thought , nor expected , nor wished for anything of the kind from him . I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me — but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side ; I never had the smallest idea of it . Pray undeceive him as soon as you can , and tell him I beg his pardon — that is — I do not know what I ought to say — but make him understand what I mean , in the properest way . I would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours , Isabella , I am sure ; but you know very well that if I could think of one man more than another—_he _ is not the person . ”
50706	50743	50702	50702	Isabella	101	“ My dear friend , you must not be angry with me . I can not suppose your brother cares so very much about me . And , you know , we shall still be sisters . ”
50744	50748	49803	49803	she	1149	“ Yes , yes ”
50755	50798	49803	49803	she	1149	“ there are more ways than one of our being sisters . But where am I wandering to ? Well , my dear Catherine , the case seems to be that you are determined against poor John — is not it so ? ”
50799	50817	50702	50702	Isabella	101	“ I certainly can not return his affection , and as certainly never meant to encourage it . ”
50818	50953	49803	49803	she	1149	“ Since that is the case , I am sure I shall not tease you any further . John desired me to speak to you on the subject , and therefore I have . But I confess , as soon as I read his letter , I thought it a very foolish , imprudent business , and not likely to promote the good of either ; for what were you to live upon , supposing you came together ? You have both of you something , to be sure , but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays ; and after all that romancers may say , there is no doing without money . I only wonder John could think of it ; he could not have received my last . ”
50954	50988	50702	50702	Isabella	101	“ You _ do _ acquit me , then , of anything wrong?—You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother , never suspected him of liking me till this moment ? ”
50989	50996	50998	50998	Isabella	101	“ Oh ! as to that , ”
51001	51108	50998	50998	Isabella	101	“ I do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been . All that is best known to yourself . A little harmless flirtation or so will occur , and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by . But you may be assured that I am the last person in the world to judge you severely . All those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits . What one means one day , you know , one may not mean the next . Circumstances change , opinions alter . ”
51109	51133	50702	50702	Isabella	101	“ But my opinion of your brother never did alter ; it was always the same . You are describing what never happened . ”
51134	51139	51141	51142	the other	412	“ My dearest Catherine , ”
51150	51360	51141	51142	the other	412	“ I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about . I do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother , because he is my brother , and who perhaps after all , you know , might be just as happy without you , for people seldom know what they would be at , young men especially , they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant . What I say is , why should a brother ’s happiness be dearer to me than a friend ’s ? You know I carry my notions of friendship pretty high . But , above all things , my dear Catherine , do not be in a hurry . Take my word for it , that if you are in too great a hurry , you will certainly live to repent it . Tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections , and I believe he is very right . Ah ! here he comes ; never mind , he will not see us , I am sure . ”
51418	51432	51403	51403	His	74	“ What ! always to be watched , in person or by proxy ! ”
51433	51438	51440	51440	Isabella	101	“ Psha , nonsense ! ”
51449	51476	51440	51440	Isabella	101	“ Why do you put such things into my head ? If I could believe it — my spirit , you know , is pretty independent . ”
51477	51492	51403	51403	His	74	“ I wish your heart were independent . That would be enough for me . ”
51493	51517	51440	51440	Isabella	101	“ My heart , indeed ! what can you have to do with hearts ? You men have none of you any hearts . ”
51518	51536	51403	51403	His	74	“ If we have not hearts , we have eyes ; and they give us torment enough . ”
51537	51569	51440	51440	Isabella	101	“ Do they ? I am sorry for it ; I am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me . I will look another way . I hope this pleases you ”
51578	51588	51440	51440	Isabella	101	“ I hope your eyes are not tormented now . ”
51589	51614	51644	51644	she	101	“ Never more so ; for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view — at once too much and too little . ”
52614	52621	52623	52623	Henry	92	“ My brother does know it , ”
52627	52638	52639	52639	He	92	“ Does he ? Then why does he stay here ? ”
52658	52729	52654	52654	she	101	“ Why do not you persuade him to go away ? The longer he stays , the worse it will be for him at last . Pray advise him for his own sake , and for everybody ’s sake , to leave Bath directly . Absence will in time make him comfortable again ; but he can have no hope here , and it is only staying to be miserable . ”
52735	52748	52730	52730	Henry	92	“ I am sure my brother would not wish to do that . ”
52749	52759	52639	52639	He	92	“ Then you will persuade him to go away ? ”
52760	52806	52730	52730	Henry	92	“ Persuasion is not at command ; but pardon me , if I can not even endeavour to persuade him . I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged . He knows what he is about , and must be his own master . ”
52807	52819	52821	52821	Catherine	73	“ No , he does not know what he is about , ”
52823	52854	52821	52821	Catherine	73	“ he does not know the pain he is giving my brother . Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable . ”
52855	52867	52730	52730	Henry	92	“ And are you sure it is my brother ’s doing ? ”
52868	52874	52821	52821	Catherine	73	“ Yes , very sure . ”
52875	52899	52730	52730	Henry	92	“ Is it my brother ’s attentions to Miss Thorpe , or Miss Thorpe ’s admission of them , that gives the pain ? ”
52900	52908	52821	52821	Catherine	73	“ Is not it the same thing ? ”
52909	52946	52730	52730	Henry	92	“ I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference . No man is offended by another man ’s admiration of the woman he loves ; it is the woman only who can make it a torment . ”
52956	53021	52947	52947	Catherine	73	“ Isabella is wrong . But I am sure she can not mean to torment , for she is very much attached to my brother . She has been in love with him ever since they first met , and while my father ’s consent was uncertain , she fretted herself almost into a fever . You know she must be attached to him . ”
53022	53038	52821	52821	Catherine	73	“ I understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . ”
53039	53059	52947	52947	Catherine	73	“ Oh no , not flirts . A woman in love with one man can not flirt with another . ”
53060	53093	52821	52821	Catherine	73	“ It is probable that she will neither love so well , nor flirt so well , as she might do either singly . The gentlemen must each give up a little . ”
53103	53118	53099	53099	Catherine	73	“ Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? ”
53119	53129	52947	52947	Catherine	73	“ I can have no opinion on that subject . ”
53130	53152	53099	53099	Catherine	73	“ But what can your brother mean ? If he knows her engagement , what can he mean by his behaviour ? ”
53153	53161	52947	52947	Catherine	73	“ You are a very close questioner . ”
53162	53176	53099	53099	Catherine	73	“ Am I ? I only ask what I want to be told . ”
53177	53191	52947	52947	Catherine	73	“ But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell ? ”
53192	53208	53099	53099	Catherine	73	“ Yes , I think so ; for you must know your brother ’s heart . ”
53209	53234	52947	52947	Catherine	73	“ My brother ’s heart , as you term it , on the present occasion , I assure you I can only guess at . ”
53235	53238	53099	53099	Catherine	73	“ Well ? ”
53239	53315	52947	52947	Catherine	73	“ Well ! nay , if it is to be guesswork , let us all guess for ourselves . To be guided by second - hand conjecture is pitiful . The premises are before you . My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man ; he has had about a week ’s acquaintance with your friend , and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her . ”
53316	53319	53321	53321	Catherine	73	“ Well , ”
53329	53389	53321	53321	Catherine	73	“ _ you _ may be able to guess at your brother ’s intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not . But is not your father uncomfortable about it ? Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away ? Sure , if your father were to speak to him , he would go . ”
53390	53396	53398	53398	Henry	92	“ My dear Miss Morland , ”
53400	53635	53398	53398	Henry	92	“ in this amiable solicitude for your brother ’s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ? Are you not carried a little too far ? Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ? Is he safe only in solitude ? Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else ? He can not think this — and you may be sure that he would not have you think it . I will not say , ‘ Do not be uneasy , ’ because I know that you are so , at this moment ; but be as little uneasy as you can . You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend ; depend upon it , therefore , that real jealousy never can exist between them ; depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration . Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . ”
53648	53728	53645	53645	he	1219	“ Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us . His leave of absence will soon expire , and he must return to his regiment . And what will then be their acquaintance ? The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney ’s passion for a month . ”
54458	54470	54444	54444	she	1226	“ How glad I shall be when you are all off . ”
54944	54965	54923	54924	the General	800	“ the day was fine , and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible . ”
55341	55348	55350	55350	Catherine	73	“ But how can that be ? ”
55352	55359	55350	55350	Catherine	73	“ Are not you with her ? ”
55360	55401	55310	55310	he	92	“ Northanger is not more than half my home ; I have an establishment at my own house in Woodston , which is nearly twenty miles from my father ’s , and some of my time is necessarily spent there . ”
55402	55411	55350	55350	Catherine	73	“ How sorry you must be for that ! ”
55412	55421	55310	55310	he	92	“ I am always sorry to leave Eleanor . ”
55422	55462	55350	55350	Catherine	73	“ Yes ; but besides your affection for her , you must be so fond of the abbey ! after being used to such a home as the abbey , an ordinary parsonage - house must be very disagreeable . ”
55469	55481	55463	55463	He	1278	“ You have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey . ”
55482	55505	55310	55310	he	92	“ To be sure , I have . Is not it a fine old place , just like what one reads about ? ”
55506	55544	55463	55463	He	1278	“ And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as ‘ what one reads about ’ may produce ? Have you a stout heart ? Nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry ? ”
55545	55604	55310	55310	he	92	“ Oh ! yes — I do not think I should be easily frightened , because there would be so many people in the house — and besides , it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years , and then the family come back to it unawares , without giving any notice , as generally happens . ”
55605	55825	55463	55463	He	1278	“ No , certainly . We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire — nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows , doors , or furniture . But you must be aware that when a young lady is ( by whatever means ) introduced into a dwelling of this kind , she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family . While they snugly repair to their own end of the house , she is formally conducted by Dorothy , the ancient housekeeper , up a different staircase , and along many gloomy passages , into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before . Can you stand such a ceremony as this ? Will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber — too lofty and extensive for you , with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size — its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life , and the bed , of dark green stuff or purple velvet , presenting even a funereal appearance ? Will not your heart sink within you ? ”
55826	55841	55310	55310	he	92	“ Oh ! but this will not happen to me , I am sure . ”
55842	56044	55463	55463	He	1278	“ How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment ! and what will you discern ? Not tables , toilettes , wardrobes , or drawers , but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute , on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open , and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior , whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you , that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it . Dorothy , meanwhile , no less struck by your appearance , gazes on you in great agitation , and drops a few unintelligible hints . To raise your spirits , moreover , she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted , and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call . With this parting cordial she curtsies off — you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you — and when , with fainting spirits , you attempt to fasten your door , you discover , with increased alarm , that it has no lock . ”
56045	56086	55310	55310	he	92	“ Oh ! mr . Tilney , how frightful ! this is just like a book ! but it can not really happen to me . I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy . Well , what then ? ”
56087	56324	55463	55463	He	1278	“ Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night . After surmounting your _ unconquerable _ horror of the bed , you will retire to rest , and get a few hours ’ unquiet slumber . But on the second , or at farthest the _ third _ night after your arrival , you will probably have a violent storm . Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains — and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it , you will probably think you discern ( for your lamp is not extinguished ) one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest . Unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it , you will instantly arise , and throwing your dressing - gown around you , proceed to examine this mystery . After a very short search , you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection , and on opening it , a door will immediately appear — which door , being only secured by massy bars and a padlock , you will , after a few efforts , succeed in opening — and , with your lamp in your hand , will pass through it into a small vaulted room . ”
56325	56342	55310	55310	he	92	“ No , indeed ; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing . ”
56343	56643	55463	55463	He	1278	“ What ! not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of St. Anthony , scarcely two miles off . Could you shrink from so simple an adventure ? No , no , you will proceed into this small vaulted room , and through this into several others , without perceiving anything very remarkable in either . In one perhaps there may be a dagger , in another a few drops of blood , and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture ; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way , and your lamp being nearly exhausted , you will return towards your own apartment . In repassing through the small vaulted room , however , your eyes will be attracted towards a large , old - fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold , which , though narrowly examining the furniture before , you had passed unnoticed . Impelled by an irresistible presentiment , you will eagerly advance to it , unlock its folding doors , and search into every drawer — but for some time without discovering anything of importance — perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds . At last , however , by touching a secret spring , an inner compartment will open — a roll of paper appears — you seize it — it contains many sheets of manuscript — you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber , but scarcely have you been able to decipher ‘ Oh thou , whomsoever thou mayst be , into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may fall’—when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket , and leaves you in total darkness . ”
56644	56661	55310	55310	he	92	“ Oh , no , no ; do not say so . Well , go on . ”
56748	56776	56713	56713	Catherine	73	“ Miss Tilney , she was sure , would never put her into such a chamber as he had described ! she was not at all afraid . ”
57821	57903	57904	57904	She	1279	“ This is strange indeed ! i did not expect such a sight as this ! an immense heavy chest ! what can it hold ? Why should it be placed here ? Pushed back too , as if meant to be out of sight ! i will look into it — cost me what it may , I will look into it — and directly too — by daylight . If I stay till evening my candle may go out . ”
58446	58458	58460	58461	Miss Tilney	90	“ That is a curious old chest , is not it ? ”
58475	58555	58460	58461	Miss Tilney	90	“ It is impossible to say how many generations it has been here . How it came to be first put in this room I know not , but I have not had it moved , because I thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets . The worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open . In that corner , however , it is at least out of the way . ”
58643	58653	58622	58622	his	138	“ Dinner to be on table _ directly ! _ ”
58929	58947	58906	58906	he	800	“ that she must have been used to much better - sized apartments at Mr. Allen ’s ? ”
58948	58953	58955	58955	Catherine	73	“ No , indeed , ”
58960	58975	58955	58955	Catherine	73	“ Mr. Allen ’s dining - parlour was not more than half as large , ”
59395	59402	59404	59404	she	1279	“ How much better is this , ”
59411	59521	59404	59404	she	1279	fender—“how much better to find a fire ready lit , than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed , as so many poor girls have been obliged to do , and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot ! how glad I am that Northanger is what it is ! if it had been like some other places , I do not know that , in such a night as this , I could have answered for my courage : but now , to be sure , there is nothing to alarm one . ”
59652	59711	59629	59629	she	1279	“ She should take her time ; she should not hurry herself ; she did not care if she were the last person up in the house . But she would not make up her fire ; _ that _ would seem cowardly , as if she wished for the protection of light after she were in bed . ”
60335	60383	60333	60333	she	1279	“ never from the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the cabinet , and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus far , it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was about it . ”
61392	61396	61342	61349	Two others , penned by the same hand	1371	“ To poultice chestnut mare”—a
61890	61900	61901	61901	she	1279	“ But we have a charming morning after it , ”
61912	61937	61901	61901	she	1279	“ and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over . What beautiful hyacinths ! i have just learnt to love a hyacinth . ”
61938	61950	61901	61901	she	1279	“ And how might you learn ? By accident or argument ? ”
61951	62003	61901	61901	she	1279	“ Your sister taught me ; I can not tell how . Mrs. Allen used to take pains , year after year , to make me like them ; but I never could , till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street ; I am naturally indifferent about flowers . ”
62004	62108	61901	61901	she	1279	“ But now you love a hyacinth . So much the better . You have gained a new source of enjoyment , and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible . Besides , a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex , as a means of getting you out of doors , and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take . And though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic , who can tell , the sentiment once raised , but you may in time come to love a rose ? ”
62109	62158	61901	61901	she	1279	“ But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors . The pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me , and in fine weather I am out more than half my time . Mamma says I am never within . ”
62159	62212	61901	61901	she	1279	“ At any rate , however , I am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth . The mere habit of learning to love is the thing ; and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing . Has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction ? ”
62495	62508	62510	62511	the General	800	“ This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother ’s fortitude , ”
62515	62527	62510	62511	the General	800	“ Woodston will make but a sombre appearance to - day . ”
62528	62535	62537	62537	Catherine	73	“ Is it a pretty place ? ”
62539	62808	62510	62511	the General	800	“ What say you , Eleanor ? Speak your opinion , for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men . I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations . The house stands among fine meadows facing the south - east , with an excellent kitchen - garden in the same aspect ; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago , for the benefit of my son . It is a family living , Miss Morland ; and the property in the place being chiefly my own , you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one . Did Henry ’s income depend solely on this living , he would not be ill - provided for . Perhaps it may seem odd , that with only two younger children , I should think any profession necessary for him ; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business . But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies , I am sure your father , Miss Morland , would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment . The money is nothing , it is not an object , but employment is the thing . Even Frederick , my eldest son , you see , who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county , has his profession . ”
62940	62965	62966	62966	She	2509	“ And when they had gone over the house , he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden . ”
62971	63099	63100	63100	He	1397	“ But perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object . The weather was at present favourable , and at this time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing so . Which would she prefer ? He was equally at her service . Which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend ’s wishes ? But he thought he could discern . Yes , he certainly read in Miss Morland ’s eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather . But when did she judge amiss ? The abbey would be always safe and dry . He yielded implicitly , and would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment . ”
63158	63196	63148	63149	Miss Tilney	90	“ I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine ; and do not be uneasy on my father ’s account ; he always walks out at this time of day . ”
63636	63760	63630	63630	he	800	“ without any ambition of that sort himself — without any solicitude about it — he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom . If he had a hobby - horse , it was _ that _ . He loved a garden . Though careless enough in most matters of eating , he loved good fruit — or if he did not , his friends and children did . There were great vexations , however , attending such a garden as his . The utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits . The pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year . Mr. Allen , he supposed , must feel these inconveniences as well as himself . ”
63761	63783	63630	63630	he	800	“ No , not at all . Mr. Allen did not care about the garden , and never went into it . ”
63825	63836	63841	63841	his	800	“ How were Mr. Allen ’s succession - houses worked ? ”
63848	63883	63841	63841	his	800	“ Mr. Allen had only one small hot - house , which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter , and there was a fire in it now and then . ”
63884	63891	63893	63894	the General	800	“ He is a happy man ! ”
63979	64014	63973	63974	Miss Morland	84	“ But where are you going , Eleanor ? Why do you choose that cold , damp path to it ? Miss Morland will get wet . Our best way is across the park . ”
64015	64025	64027	64028	Miss Tilney	90	“ This is so favourite a walk of mine , ”
64030	64049	64027	64028	Miss Tilney	90	“ that I always think it the best and nearest way . But perhaps it may be damp . ”
64130	64152	64120	64120	He	800	“ The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him , and he would meet them by another course . ”
64208	64217	64219	64220	her companion	569	“ I am particularly fond of this spot , ”
64226	64235	64219	64220	her companion	569	“ It was my mother ’s favourite walk . ”
64277	64288	64290	64290	Eleanor	142	“ I used to walk here so often with her ! ”
64292	64326	64290	64290	Eleanor	142	“ though I never loved it then , as I have loved it since . At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice . But her memory endears it now . ”
64327	64333	64335	64335	Catherine	73	“ And ought it not , ”
64337	64353	64335	64335	Catherine	73	“ to endear it to her husband ? Yet the General would not enter it . ”
64364	64374	64359	64359	she	84	“ Her death must have been a great affliction ! ”
64375	64382	64384	64385	the other	412	“ A great and increasing one , ”
64392	64434	64359	64359	she	84	“ I was only thirteen when it happened ; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it , I did not , I could not , then know what a loss it was . ”
64449	64495	64435	64435	She	84	“ I have no sister , you know — and though Henry — though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . ”
64496	64507	64435	64435	She	84	“ To be sure you must miss him very much . ”
64508	64535	64435	64435	She	84	“ A mother would have been always present . A mother would have been a constant friend ; her influence would have been beyond all other . ”
64536	64574	64435	64435	She	84	“ Was she a very charming woman ? Was she handsome ? Was there any picture of her in the abbey ? And why had she been so partial to that grove ? Was it from dejection of spirits?”—were
64676	64683	64664	64664	his	800	“ Her picture , I suppose , ”
64694	64702	64664	64664	his	800	“ hangs in your father ’s room ? ”
64703	64768	64791	64791	he	800	“ No ; it was intended for the drawing - room ; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting , and for some time it had no place . Soon after her death I obtained it for my own , and hung it in my bed - chamber — where I shall be happy to show it you ; it is very like . ”
65088	65112	65115	65115	he	800	“ This lengthened absence , these solitary rambles , did not speak a mind at ease , or a conscience void of reproach . ”
66420	66426	66427	66427	She	84	“ our friends from Fullerton . ”
66728	66750	66753	66753	her	84	“ I was going to take you into what was my mother ’s room — the room in which she died — ”
66890	66900	66902	66902	she	84	“ It remains as it was , I suppose ? ”
66910	66915	66902	66902	she	84	“ Yes , entirely . ”
66916	66929	66873	66873	her	84	“ And how long ago may it be that your mother died ? ”
66930	66939	66902	66902	she	84	“ She has been dead these nine years . ”
66974	66987	66873	66873	her	84	“ You were with her , I suppose , to the last ? ”
66988	66991	66993	66994	Miss Tilney	90	“ No , ”
66998	67022	66993	66994	Miss Tilney	90	“ I was unfortunately from home . Her illness was sudden and short ; and , before I arrived it was all over . ”
67178	67182	67183	67183	she	84	“ My father , ”
67186	67201	67183	67183	she	84	“ often walks about the room in this way ; it is nothing unusual . ”
67202	67208	67210	67210	Catherine	73	“ So much the worse ! ”
67312	67320	67322	67322	he	1093	“ I have many pamphlets to finish , ”
67326	67385	67322	67322	he	1093	“ before I can close my eyes , and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep . Can either of us be more meetly employed ? _ My _ eyes will be blinding for the good of others , and _ yours _ preparing by rest for future mischief . ”
68759	68761	68768	68768	his	800	“ Eleanor ”
69022	69033	69034	69034	she	128	“ My father only wanted me to answer a note , ”
69892	69896	69897	69897	she	128	“ Mr. Tilney ! ”
69913	69917	69918	69918	she	128	“ Good God ! ”
69927	69940	69918	69918	she	128	“ How came you here ? How came you up that staircase ? ”
69941	69949	69950	69950	he	92	“ How came I up that staircase ! ”
69956	69982	69950	69950	he	92	“ Because it is my nearest way from the stable - yard to my own chamber ; and why should I not come up it ? ”
70021	70031	70033	70033	he	92	“ And may I not , in my turn , ”
70043	70081	70033	70033	he	92	“ ask how _ you _ came here ? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast - parlour to your apartment , as that staircase can be from the stables to mine . ”
70082	70087	70089	70089	Catherine	73	“ I have been , ”
70094	70102	70089	70089	Catherine	73	“ to see your mother ’s room . ”
70103	70118	70033	70033	he	92	“ My mother ’s room ! is there anything extraordinary to be seen there ? ”
70119	70140	70089	70089	Catherine	73	“ No , nothing at all . I thought you did not mean to come back till to - morrow . ”
70141	70211	70033	70033	he	92	“ I did not expect to be able to return sooner , when I went away ; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me . You look pale . I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs . Perhaps you did not know — you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use ? ”
70212	70230	70089	70089	Catherine	73	“ No , I was not . You have had a very fine day for your ride . ”
70231	70253	70033	70033	he	92	“ Very ; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself ? ”
70254	70280	70282	70282	her	1673	“ Oh no ! she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday — and we were coming here to these rooms — but only , ”
70285	70292	70282	70282	her	1673	“ your father was with us . ”
70293	70299	70301	70301	Henry	92	“ And that prevented you , ”
70307	70319	70301	70301	Henry	92	“ Have you looked into all the rooms in that passage ? ”
70320	70341	70282	70282	her	1673	“ No , I only wanted to see — Is not it very late ? I must go and dress . ”
70342	70351	70301	70301	Henry	92	“ It is only a quarter past four , ”
70356	70383	70301	70301	Henry	92	“ and you are not now in Bath . No theatre , no rooms to prepare for . Half an hour at Northanger must be enough . ”
70427	70440	70420	70420	They	1674	“ Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you ? ”
70441	70459	70420	70420	They	1674	“ No , and I am very much surprised . Isabella promised so faithfully to write directly . ”
70460	70574	70420	70420	They	1674	“ Promised so faithfully ! a faithful promise ! that puzzles me . I have heard of a faithful performance . But a faithful promise — the fidelity of promising ! it is a power little worth knowing , however , since it can deceive and pain you . My mother ’s room is very commodious , is it not ? Large and cheerful - looking , and the dressing - closets so well disposed ! It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house , and I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own . She sent you to look at it , I suppose ? ”
70575	70578	70420	70420	They	1674	“ No . ”
70579	70588	70420	70420	They	1674	“ It has been your own doing entirely ? ”
70609	70719	70606	70606	he	1676	“ As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity , this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother ’s character , as described by Eleanor , which does honour to her memory . The world , I believe , never saw a better woman . But it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this . The domestic , unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent , venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours . Eleanor , I suppose , has talked of her a great deal ? ”
70720	70748	70798	70798	his	1678	“ Yes , a great deal . That is — no , not much , but what she did say was very interesting . Her dying so suddenly ”
70760	70787	70798	70798	his	1678	“ and you — none of you being at home — and your father , I thought — perhaps had not been very fond of her . ”
70788	70794	70795	70795	he	1678	“ And from these circumstances , ”
70806	70816	70817	70817	she	1679	“ you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence — some”—(involuntarily
70820	70831	70819	70819	her	1679	head)—“or it may be — of something still less pardonable . ”
70847	70853	70854	70854	he	1678	“ My mother ’s illness , ”
70857	71045	70854	70854	he	1678	“ the seizure which ended in her death , _ was _ sudden . The malady itself , one from which she had often suffered , a bilious fever — its cause therefore constitutional . On the third day , in short , as soon as she could be prevailed on , a physician attended her , a very respectable man , and one in whom she had always placed great confidence . Upon his opinion of her danger , two others were called in the next day , and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours . On the fifth day she died . During the progress of her disorder , Frederick and I ( _ we _ were both at home ) saw her repeatedly ; and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her , or which her situation in life could command . Poor Eleanor was absent , and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin . ”
71046	71051	71053	71053	Catherine	73	“ But your father , ”
71055	71062	71053	71053	Catherine	73	“ was _ he _ afflicted ? ”
71063	71169	70854	70854	he	1678	“ For a time , greatly so . You have erred in supposing him not attached to her . He loved her , I am persuaded , as well as it was possible for him to — we have not all , you know , the same tenderness of disposition — and I will not pretend to say that while she lived , she might not often have had much to bear , but though his temper injured her , his judgment never did . His value of her was sincere ; and , if not permanently , he was truly afflicted by her death . ”
71170	71178	71180	71180	Catherine	73	“ I am very glad of it , ”
71182	71190	71180	71180	Catherine	73	“ it would have been very shocking ! ”
71191	71352	71353	71353	They	1680	“ If I understand you rightly , you had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to — Dear Miss Morland , consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained . What have you been judging from ? Remember the country and the age in which we live . Remember that we are English , that we are Christians . Consult your own understanding , your own sense of the probable , your own observation of what is passing around you . Does our education prepare us for such atrocities ? Do our laws connive at them ? Could they be perpetrated without being known , in a country like this , where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing , where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies , and where roads and newspapers lay everything open ? Dearest Miss Morland , what ideas have you been admitting ? ”
72560	72569	72571	72571	she	1682	“ ’ Tis only from James , however , ”
72591	72595	72577	72577	She	1682	“ Dear Catherine , “
72938	72942	72945	72945	Catherine	73	“ Believe me , ”
73341	73370	73338	73338	Eleanor	142	“ No bad news from Fullerton , I hope ? Mr. and Mrs. Morland — your brothers and sisters — I hope they are none of them ill ? ”
73371	73377	73381	73381	she	1711	“ No , I thank you ”
73385	73401	73381	73381	she	1711	“ they are all very well . My letter was from my brother at Oxford . ”
73421	73435	73418	73418	she	1711	“ I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter again ! ”
73436	73441	73443	73443	Henry	92	“ I am sorry , ”
73453	73475	73443	73443	Henry	92	“ if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome , I should have given it with very different feelings . ”
73476	73498	73418	73418	she	1711	“ It contained something worse than anybody could suppose ! poor James is so unhappy ! you will soon know why . ”
73499	73512	73514	73514	Henry	92	“ To have so kind - hearted , so affectionate a sister , ”
73517	73528	73514	73514	Henry	92	“ must be a comfort to him under any distress . ”
73529	73537	73539	73539	Catherine	73	“ I have one favour to beg , ”
73549	73574	73539	73539	Catherine	73	“ that , if your brother should be coming here , you will give me notice of it , that I may go away . ”
73575	73581	73514	73514	Henry	92	“ Our brother ! frederick ! ”
73582	73621	73539	73539	Catherine	73	“ Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . ”
73658	73664	73666	73666	Catherine	73	“ How quick you are ! ”
73668	73743	73666	73666	Catherine	73	“ you have guessed it , I declare ! And yet , when we talked about it in Bath , you little thought of its ending so . Isabella — no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her — Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours ! could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? ”
73744	73830	73930	73930	He	1731	“ I hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed . I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland ’s disappointment . His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable . I think you must be deceived so far . I am very sorry for Mr. Morland — sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy ; but my surprise would be greater at Frederick ’s marrying her than at any other part of the story . ”
73831	73854	73666	73666	Catherine	73	“ It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ”
73863	73880	73930	73930	He	1731	“ Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? ”
73881	73888	73890	73890	Catherine	73	“ No , read it yourself , ”
73898	73908	73890	73890	Catherine	73	“ I do not know what I was thinking of ”
73919	73929	73890	73890	Catherine	73	“ James only means to give me good advice . ”
73951	74007	73930	73930	He	1731	“ Well , if it is to be so , I can only say that I am sorry for it . Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected . I do not envy his situation , either as a lover or a son . ”
74043	74054	74056	74056	Catherine	73	“ Her mother is a very good sort of woman , ”
74060	74066	74027	74027	her	1730	“ What was her father ? ”
74067	74079	74027	74027	her	1730	“ A lawyer , I believe . They live at Putney . ”
74080	74087	74027	74027	her	1730	“ Are they a wealthy family ? ”
74088	74144	74027	74027	her	1730	“ No , not very . I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all : but that will not signify in your family . Your father is so very liberal ! He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children . ”
74154	74157	74159	74159	Eleanor	142	“ But , ”
74166	74258	74159	74159	Eleanor	142	“ would it be to promote his happiness , to enable him to marry such a girl ? She must be an unprincipled one , or she could not have used your brother so . And how strange an infatuation on Frederick ’s side ! a girl who , before his eyes , is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man ! is not it inconceivable , Henry ? Frederick too , who always wore his heart so proudly ! who found no woman good enough to be loved ! ”
74259	74380	74027	74027	her	1730	“ That is the most unpromising circumstance , the strongest presumption against him . When I think of his past declarations , I give him up . Moreover , I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe ’s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured . It is all over with Frederick indeed ! he is a deceased man — defunct in understanding . Prepare for your sister - in - law , Eleanor , and such a sister - in - law as you must delight in ! open , candid , artless , guileless , with affections strong but simple , forming no pretensions , and knowing no disguise . ”
74381	74397	74399	74399	Eleanor	142	“ Such a sister - in - law , Henry , I should delight in , ”
74404	74408	74410	74410	Catherine	73	“ But perhaps , ”
74412	74445	74410	74410	Catherine	73	“ though she has behaved so ill by our family , she may behave better by yours . Now she has really got the man she likes , she may be constant . ”
74446	74454	74456	74456	Henry	92	“ Indeed I am afraid she will , ”
74458	74497	74456	74456	Henry	92	“ I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick ’s only chance . I will get the Bath paper , and look over the arrivals . ”
74498	74567	74027	74027	her	1730	“ You think it is all for ambition , then ? And , upon my word , there are some things that seem very like it . I can not forget that , when she first knew what my father would do for them , she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more . I never was so deceived in anyone ’s character in my life before . ”
74568	74581	74456	74456	Henry	92	“ Among all the great variety that you have known and studied . ”
74582	74610	74027	74027	her	1730	“ My own disappointment and loss in her is very great ; but , as for poor James , I suppose he will hardly ever recover it . ”
74611	74758	74456	74456	Henry	92	“ Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present ; but we must not , in our concern for his sufferings , undervalue yours . You feel , I suppose , that in losing Isabella , you lose half yourself : you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy . Society is becoming irksome ; and as for the amusements in which you were wo nt to share at Bath , the very idea of them without her is abhorrent . You would not , for instance , now go to a ball for the world . You feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve , on whose regard you can place dependence , or whose counsel , in any difficulty , you could rely on . You feel all this ? ”
74759	74762	74764	74764	Catherine	73	“ No , ”
74773	74833	74764	74764	Catherine	73	“ I do not — ought I ? To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought . ”
74834	74866	74456	74456	Henry	92	“ You feel , as you always do , what is most to the credit of human nature . Such feelings ought to be investigated , that they may know themselves . ”
75319	75322	75324	75324	he	800	“ No , ”
75326	75354	75324	75324	he	800	“ my father ’s hands need not be strengthened , and Frederick ’s confession of folly need not be forestalled . He must tell his own story . ”
75355	75365	75315	75315	she	101	“ But he will tell only half of it . ”
75366	75373	75324	75324	he	800	“ A quarter would be enough . ”
75626	75668	75618	75618	Catherine	73	“ And when do you think , sir , I may look forward to this pleasure ? I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting , and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days . ”
75669	75968	75609	75609	Henry	92	“ Well , well , we will take our chance some one of those days . There is no need to fix . You are not to put yourself at all out of your way . Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough . I think I can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor ’s table . Let me see ; Monday will be a busy day with you , we will not come on Monday ; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me . I expect my surveyor from Brockham with his report in the morning ; and afterwards I can not in decency fail attending the club . I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now ; for , as I am known to be in the country , it would be taken exceedingly amiss ; and it is a rule with me , Miss Morland , never to give offence to any of my neighbours , if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it . They are a set of very worthy men . They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year ; and I dine with them whenever I can . Tuesday , therefore , we may say is out of the question . But on Wednesday , I think , Henry , you may expect us ; and we shall be with you early , that we may have time to look about us . Two hours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston , I suppose ; we shall be in the carriage by ten ; so , about a quarter before one on Wednesday , you may look for us . ”
76029	76137	76005	76005	Henry	92	“ I am come , young ladies , in a very moralizing strain , to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for , and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage , giving ready - monied actual happiness for a draft on the future , that may not be honoured . Witness myself , at this present hour . Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on Wednesday , which bad weather , or twenty other causes , may prevent , I must go away directly , two days before I intended it . ”
76138	76142	76144	76144	Catherine	73	“ Go away ! ”
76152	76156	76144	76144	Catherine	73	“ And why ? ”
76157	76199	76005	76005	Henry	92	“ Why ! how can you ask the question ? Because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits , because I must go and prepare a dinner for you , to be sure . ”
76200	76206	76144	76144	Catherine	73	“ Oh ! not seriously ! ”
76207	76221	76005	76005	Henry	92	“ Aye , and sadly too — for I had much rather stay . ”
76222	76259	76144	76144	Catherine	73	“ But how can you think of such a thing , after what the General said ? When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble , because _ anything _ would do . ”
76264	76339	76260	76260	Henry	92	“ I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister ’s account and mine . You must know it to be so ; and the General made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary : besides , if he had not said half so much as he did , he has always such an excellent dinner at home , that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify . ”
76340	76374	76375	76375	He	92	“ I wish I could reason like you , for his sake and my own . Good - bye . As to - morrow is Sunday , Eleanor , I shall not return . ”
77034	77044	77046	77046	he	800	“ We are not calling it a good house , ”
77048	77163	77046	77046	he	800	“ We are not comparing it with Fullerton and Northanger — we are considering it as a mere parsonage , small and confined , we allow , but decent , perhaps , and habitable ; and altogether not inferior to the generality ; or , in other words , I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so good . It may admit of improvement , however . Far be it from me to say otherwise ; and anything in reason — a bow thrown out , perhaps — though , between ourselves , if there is one thing more than another my aversion , it is a patched - on bow . ”
77366	77409	77348	77348	she	1800	“ Oh ! why do not you fit up this room , Mr. Tilney ? What a pity not to have it fitted up ! it is the prettiest room I ever saw ; it is the prettiest room in the world ! ”
77410	77414	77416	77417	the General	800	“ I trust , ”
77425	77443	77416	77417	the General	800	“ that it will very speedily be furnished : it waits only for a lady ’s taste ! ”
77444	77484	77348	77348	she	1800	“ Well , if it was my house , I should never sit anywhere else . Oh ! what a sweet little cottage there is among the trees — apple trees , too ! it is the prettiest cottage ! ”
77485	77516	77416	77417	the General	800	“ You like it — you approve it as an object — it is enough . Henry , remember that Robinson is spoken to about it . The cottage remains . ”
78859	78881	78855	78855	her	2292	“ Write to James on her behalf ! no , James should never hear Isabella ’s name mentioned by her again . ”
78926	78931	78932	78932	she	2292	it—“So much for Isabella , ”
78935	79022	78932	78932	she	2292	“ and for all our intimacy ! she must think me an idiot , or she could not have written so ; but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her . I see what she has been about . She is a vain coquette , and her tricks have not answered . I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me , and I wish I had never known her . ”
79023	79034	79036	79036	Henry	92	“ It will soon be as if you never had , ”
79038	79103	78932	78932	she	2292	“ There is but one thing that I can not understand . I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney , which have not succeeded ; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time . Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother , and then fly off himself ? ”
79104	79179	78932	78932	she	2292	“ I have very little to say for Frederick ’s motives , such as I believe them to have been . He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe , and the chief difference is , that , having a stronger head , they have not yet injured himself . If the _ effect _ of his behaviour does not justify him with you , we had better not seek after the cause . ”
79180	79193	78932	78932	she	2292	“ Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her ? ”
79194	79203	78932	78932	she	2292	“ I am persuaded that he never did . ”
79204	79217	78932	78932	she	2292	“ And only made believe to do so for mischief ’s sake ? ”
79223	79295	78932	78932	she	2292	“ Well , then , I must say that I do not like him at all . Though it has turned out so well for us , I do not like him at all . As it happens , there is no great harm done , because I do not think Isabella has any heart to lose . But , suppose he had made her very much in love with him ? ”
79296	79335	78932	78932	she	2292	“ But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose — consequently to have been a very different creature ; and , in that case , she would have met with very different treatment . ”
79336	79349	78932	78932	she	2292	“ It is very right that you should stand by your brother . ”
79350	79405	78932	78932	she	2292	“ And if you would stand by _ yours _ , you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe . But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity , and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality , or a desire of revenge . ”
79825	79894	79895	79895	Catherine	73	“ hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time — had been misled ( perhaps by her wishes ) to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised — and could not but think that if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have her there , they would be too generous to hasten her return . ”
79898	79930	79895	79895	Catherine	73	“ Oh ! as to _ that _ , Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all . As long as she was happy , they would always be satisfied . ”
79931	79948	79895	79895	Catherine	73	“ Then why , might she ask , in such a hurry herself to leave them ? ”
79949	79960	79895	79895	Catherine	73	“ Oh ! because she had been there so long . ”
79961	79985	79895	79895	Catherine	73	“ Nay , if you can use such a word , I can urge you no farther . If you think it long — ”
79986	80010	79895	79895	Catherine	73	“ Oh ! no , I do not indeed . For my own pleasure , I could stay with you as long again . ”
80347	80357	80363	80363	Eleanor	142	“ Good heaven ! what can be the matter ? ”
80797	80811	80756	80756	Catherine	73	“ My dear Catherine , you must not — you must not indeed — ”
80819	80845	80756	80756	Catherine	73	“ I am quite well . This kindness distracts me — I can not bear it — I come to you on such an errand ! ”
80846	80852	80887	80887	she	1888	“ Errand ! to me ! ”
80853	80868	80756	80756	Catherine	73	“ How shall I tell you ! oh ! how shall I tell you ! ”
80890	80898	80887	80887	she	1888	“ ’ Tis a messenger from Woodston ! ”
80899	80906	80908	80908	Eleanor	142	“ You are mistaken , indeed , ”
80916	80930	80908	80908	Eleanor	142	“ it is no one from Woodston . It is my father himself . ”
81008	81168	80986	80986	Eleanor	142	“ You are too good , I am sure , to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform . I am indeed a most unwilling messenger . After what has so lately passed , so lately been settled between us — how joyfully , how thankfully on my side!—as to your continuing here as I hoped for many , many weeks longer , how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted — and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by — But I must not trust myself with words . My dear Catherine , we are to part . My father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on Monday . We are going to Lord Longtown ’s , near Hereford , for a fortnight . Explanation and apology are equally impossible . I can not attempt either . ”
81169	81174	81176	81176	Catherine	73	“ My dear Eleanor , ”
81187	81272	81176	81176	Catherine	73	“ do not be so distressed . A second engagement must give way to a first . I am very , very sorry we are to part — so soon , and so suddenly too ; but I am not offended , indeed I am not . I can finish my visit here , you know , at any time ; or I hope you will come to me . Can you , when you return from this lord ’s , come to Fullerton ? ”
81273	81284	80986	80986	Eleanor	142	“ It will not be in my power , Catherine . ”
81285	81293	81176	81176	Catherine	73	“ Come when you can , then . ”
81316	81428	81310	81310	she	1896	“ Monday — so soon as Monday ; and you _ all _ go . Well , I am certain of — I shall be able to take leave , however . I need not go till just before you do , you know . Do not be distressed , Eleanor , I can go on Monday very well . My father and mother ’s having no notice of it is of very little consequence . The General will send a servant with me , I dare say , half the way — and then I shall soon be at Salisbury , and then I am only nine miles from home . ”
81429	81511	80986	80986	Eleanor	142	“ Ah , Catherine ! were it settled so , it would be somewhat less intolerable , though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought . But — how can I tell you?—to - morrow morning is fixed for your leaving us , and not even the hour is left to your choice ; the very carriage is ordered , and will be here at seven o’clock , and no servant will be offered you . ”
81520	81686	81512	81512	Catherine	73	“ I could hardly believe my senses , when I heard it ; and no displeasure , no resentment that you can feel at this moment , however justly great , can be more than I myself — but I must not talk of what I felt . Oh ! that I could suggest anything in extenuation ! good God ! what will your father and mother say ! after courting you from the protection of real friends to this — almost double distance from your home , to have you driven out of the house , without the considerations even of decent civility ! dear , dear Catherine , in being the bearer of such a message , I seem guilty myself of all its insult ; yet , I trust you will acquit me , for you must have been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress of it , that my real power is nothing . ”
81687	81694	81696	81696	Catherine	73	“ Have I offended the General ? ”
81702	81805	80986	80986	Eleanor	142	“ Alas ! for my feelings as a daughter , all that I know , all that I answer for , is that you can have given him no just cause of offence . He certainly is greatly , very greatly discomposed ; I have seldom seen him more so . His temper is not happy , and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree ; some disappointment , some vexation , which just at this moment seems important , but which I can hardly suppose you to have any concern in , for how is it possible ? ”
81830	81835	81837	81837	she	1897	“ I am sure , ”
81839	81904	81837	81837	she	1897	“ I am very sorry if I have offended him . It was the last thing I would willingly have done . But do not be unhappy , Eleanor . An engagement , you know , must be kept . I am only sorry it was not recollected sooner , that I might have written home . But it is of very little consequence . ”
81905	82000	81822	81822	Eleanor	142	“ I hope , I earnestly hope , that to your real safety it will be of none ; but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence : to comfort , appearance , propriety , to your family , to the world . Were your friends , the Allens , still in Bath , you might go to them with comparative ease ; a few hours would take you there ; but a journey of seventy miles , to be taken post by you , at your age , alone , unattended ! ”
82001	82050	82051	82051	Eleanor	142	“ Oh , the journey is nothing . Do not think about that . And if we are to part , a few hours sooner or later , you know , makes no difference . I can be ready by seven . Let me be called in time . ”
82079	82088	82054	82054	she	1898	“ I shall see you in the morning . ”
83039	83050	83051	83051	she	1923	“ You _ must _ write to me , Catherine , ”
83054	83168	83051	83051	she	1923	“ you _ must _ let me hear from you as soon as possible . Till I know you to be safe at home , I shall not have an hour ’s comfort . For _ one _ letter , at all risks , all hazards , I must entreat . Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at Fullerton , and have found your family well , and then , till I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do , I will not expect more . Direct to me at Lord Longtown ’s , and , I must ask it , under cover to Alice . ”
83169	83206	83207	83207	Eleanor	142	“ No , Eleanor , if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me , I am sure I had better not write . There can be no doubt of my getting home safe . ”
83211	83244	83207	83207	Eleanor	142	“ I can not wonder at your feelings . I will not importune you . I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you . ”
83272	83286	83268	83268	she	1924	“ Oh , Eleanor , I _ will _ write to you indeed . ”
83518	83527	83502	83502	she	1924	“ her kind remembrance for her absent friend . ”
85358	85375	85419	85420	her mother	188	“ it was a strange business , and that he must be a very strange man , ”
85403	85417	85419	85420	her mother	188	“ My dear , you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble , ”
85424	85438	85419	85420	her mother	188	“ depend upon it , it is something not at all worth understanding . ”
85439	85455	85457	85457	Sarah	76	“ I can allow for his wishing Catherine away , when he recollected this engagement , ”
85459	85467	85457	85457	Sarah	76	“ but why not do it civilly ? ”
85468	85477	85479	85480	Mrs. Morland	78	“ I am sorry for the young people , ”
85482	85520	85521	85521	Catherine	73	“ they must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General Tilney . ”
85524	85527	85521	85521	Catherine	73	“ Well , ”
85533	85640	85521	85521	Catherine	73	“ I am glad I did not know of your journey at the time ; but now it is all over , perhaps there is no great harm done . It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves ; and you know , my dear Catherine , you always were a sad little scatter - brained creature ; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you , with so much changing of chaises and so forth ; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets . ”
86037	86045	86047	86048	Mrs. Morland	78	“ This has been a strange acquaintance , ”
86056	86122	86047	86048	Mrs. Morland	78	“ soon made and soon ended . I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella . Ah ! poor James ! well , we must live and learn ; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping . ”
86130	86141	86126	86126	she	1149	“ No friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor . ”
86142	86194	86195	86196	Mrs. Morland	78	“ If so , my dear , I dare say you will meet again some time or other ; do not be uneasy . It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years ; and then what a pleasure it will be ! ”
86355	86362	86364	86364	she	78	“ We are sorry for him , ”
86366	86468	86364	86364	she	78	“ but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off ; for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with , and who was so entirely without fortune ; and now , after such behaviour , we can not think at all well of her . Just at present it comes hard to poor James ; but that will not last forever ; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life , for the foolishness of his first choice . ”
86675	86685	86687	86687	she	78	“ Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening , ”
86689	86790	86687	86687	she	78	“ She travelled all the way post by herself , and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night ; for General Tilney , from some odd fancy or other , all of a sudden grew tired of having her there , and almost turned her out of the house . Very unfriendly , certainly ; and he must be a very odd man ; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again ! and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . ”
86846	86853	86838	86838	hers	86	remark—“I really have not patience with the General”—to
86862	86872	86914	86914	she	2011	“ I really have not patience with the General , ”
86918	87016	86914	86914	she	2011	“ Only think , my dear , of my having got that frightful great rent in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended , before I left Bath , that one can hardly see where it was . I must show it you some day or other . Bath is a nice place , Catherine , after all . I assure you I did not above half like coming away . Mrs. Thorpe ’s being there was such a comfort to us , was not it ? You know , you and I were quite forlorn at first . ”
87017	87029	87031	87031	Catherine	73	“ Yes , but _ that _ did not last long , ”
87050	87117	86914	86914	she	2011	“ Very true : we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe , and then we wanted for nothing . My dear , do not you think these silk gloves wear very well ? I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms , you know , and I have worn them a great deal since . Do you remember that evening ? ”
87118	87126	87033	87033	her	2012	“ Do I ! oh ! perfectly . ”
87127	87183	86914	86914	she	2011	“ It was very agreeable , was not it ? Mr. Tilney drank tea with us , and I always thought him a great addition , he is so very agreeable . I have a notion you danced with him , but am not quite sure . I remember I had my favourite gown on . ”
87203	87268	86914	86914	she	2011	to—“I really have not patience with the General ! such an agreeable , worthy man as he seemed to be ! i do not suppose , Mrs. Morland , you ever saw a better - bred man in your life . His lodgings were taken the very day after he left them , Catherine . But no wonder ; Milsom Street , you know . ”
87649	87733	87638	87638	she	266	“ My dear Catherine , I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady . I do not know when poor Richard ’s cravats would be done , if he had no friend but you . Your head runs too much upon Bath ; but there is a time for everything — a time for balls and plays , and a time for work . You have had a long run of amusement , and now you must try to be useful . ”
87749	87760	87734	87734	Catherine	73	“ her head did not run upon Bath — much . ”
