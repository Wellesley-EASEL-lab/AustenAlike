1103	1146	1147	1147	He	89	" Yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome ! It would be enough to make them completely easy . Three thousand pounds ! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience . "--
2181	2192	2194	2195	her husband	333	" It was my father 's last request to me , "
2197	2207	2194	2195	her husband	333	" that I should assist his widow and daughters . "
2208	2267	2194	2195	her husband	333	" He did not know what he was talking of , I dare say ; ten to one but he was light - headed at the time . Had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child . "
2268	2390	2194	2195	her husband	333	" He did not stipulate for any particular sum , my dear Fanny ; he only requested me , in general terms , to assist them , and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do . Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself . He could hardly suppose I should neglect them . But as he required the promise , I could not do less than give it ; at least I thought so at the time . The promise , therefore , was given , and must be performed . Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home . "
2391	2415	2416	2416	she	384	" Well , then , LET something be done for them ; but THAT something need not be three thousand pounds . Consider , "
2419	2460	2416	2416	she	384	" that when the money is once parted with , it never can return . Your sisters will marry , and it will be gone for ever . If , indeed , it could be restored to our poor little boy-- "
2461	2468	2470	2471	her husband	333	" Why , to be sure , "
2476	2519	2470	2471	her husband	333	" that would make great difference . The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with . If he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition . "
2520	2527	2194	2195	her husband	333	" To be sure it would . "
2528	2559	2470	2471	her husband	333	" Perhaps , then , it would be better for all parties , if the sum were diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes ! "
2560	2601	2194	2195	her husband	333	" Oh ! beyond anything great ! What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters , even if REALLY his sisters ! And as it is -- only half blood!--But you have such a generous spirit ! "
2602	2613	2614	2614	he	333	" I would not wish to do any thing mean , "
2617	2658	2614	2614	he	333	" One had rather , on such occasions , do too much than too little . No one , at least , can think I have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more . "
2659	2669	2671	2672	the lady	386	" There is no knowing what THEY may expect , "
2674	2696	2671	2672	the lady	386	" but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do . "
2697	2749	2614	2614	he	333	" Certainly -- and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a - piece . As it is , without any addition of mine , they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother 's death -- a very comfortable fortune for any young woman . "
2750	2816	2671	2672	the lady	386	" To be sure it is ; and , indeed , it strikes me that they can want no addition at all . They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them . If they marry , they will be sure of doing well , and if they do not , they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds . "
2817	2889	2614	2614	he	333	" That is very true , and , therefore , I do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them -- something of the annuity kind I mean.--My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself . A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable . "
2906	2911	2913	2913	she	294	" To be sure , "
2915	2946	2913	2913	she	294	" it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once . But , then , if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in . "
2947	2965	2671	2672	the lady	386	" Fifteen years ! my dear Fanny ; her life can not be worth half that purchase . "
2966	3209	2913	2913	she	294	" Certainly not ; but if you observe , people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them ; and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty . An annuity is a very serious business ; it comes over and over every year , and there is no getting rid of it . You are not aware of what you are doing . I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities ; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father 's will , and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it . Twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing . My mother was quite sick of it . Her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother 's disposal , without any restriction whatever . It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world . "
3210	3218	3220	3221	Mr. Dashwood	87	" It is certainly an unpleasant thing , "
3223	3283	3220	3221	Mr. Dashwood	87	" to have those kind of yearly drains on one 's income . One 's fortune , as your mother justly says , is NOT one 's own . To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one 's independence . "
3284	3369	2913	2913	she	294	" Undoubtedly ; and after all you have no thanks for it . They think themselves secure , you do no more than what is expected , and it raises no gratitude at all . If I were you , whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely . I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly . It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses . "
3370	3488	3220	3221	Mr. Dashwood	87	" I believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should by no annuity in the case ; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year . It will certainly be much the best way . A present of fifty pounds , now and then , will prevent their ever being distressed for money , and will , I think , be amply discharging my promise to my father . "
3489	3803	2913	2913	she	294	" To be sure it will . Indeed , to say the truth , I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all . The assistance he thought of , I dare say , was only such as might be reasonably expected of you ; for instance , such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them , helping them to move their things , and sending them presents of fish and game , and so forth , whenever they are in season . I 'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther ; indeed , it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did . Do but consider , my dear Mr. Dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother - in - law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a - piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it . Altogether , they will have five hundred a - year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that?--They will live so cheap ! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all . They will have no carriage , no horses , and hardly any servants ; they will keep no company , and can have no expenses of any kind ! Only conceive how comfortable they will be ! Five hundred a year ! I am sure I can not imagine how they will spend half of it ; and as to your giving them more , it is quite absurd to think of it . They will be much more able to give YOU something . "
3804	3809	3811	3812	Mr. Dashwood	87	" Upon my word , "
3814	3899	3811	3812	Mr. Dashwood	87	" I believe you are perfectly right . My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say . I clearly understand it now , and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described . When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can . Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then . "
3900	3903	3905	3907	Mrs. John Dashwood	90	" Certainly , "
3909	3972	3905	3907	Mrs. John Dashwood	90	" But , however , ONE thing must be considered . When your father and mother moved to Norland , though the furniture of Stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother . Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it . "
3973	4005	3811	3812	Mr. Dashwood	87	" That is a material consideration undoubtedly . A valuable legacy indeed ! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here . "
4006	4105	3905	3907	Mrs. John Dashwood	90	" Yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house . A great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place THEY can ever afford to live in . But , however , so it is . Your father thought only of THEM . And I must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM . "
5108	5113	5115	5115	she	90	" It is enough , "
5117	5138	5115	5115	she	90	" to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough . It implies everything amiable . I love him already . "
5139	5147	5149	5149	Elinor	91	" I think you will like him , "
5151	5159	5149	5149	Elinor	91	" when you know more of him . "
5160	5164	5166	5167	her mother	347	" Like him ! "
5172	5183	5166	5167	her mother	347	" I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love . "
5184	5190	5166	5167	her mother	347	" You may esteem him . "
5191	5206	5166	5167	her mother	347	" I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love . "
5333	5343	5345	5345	she	90	" In a few months , my dear Marianne . "
5347	5370	5345	5345	she	90	" Elinor will , in all probability be settled for life . We shall miss her ; but SHE will be happy . "
5371	5383	5302	5302	she	90	" Oh ! Mamma , how shall we do without her ? "
5384	5455	5345	5345	she	90	" My love , it will be scarcely a separation . We shall live within a few miles of each other , and shall meet every day of our lives . You will gain a brother , a real , affectionate brother . I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward 's heart . But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister 's choice ? "
5456	5459	5461	5461	Marianne	92	" Perhaps , "
5463	5751	5461	5461	Marianne	92	" I may consider it with some surprise . Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly . But yet -- he is not the kind of young man -- there is something wanting -- his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . His eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence . And besides all this , I am afraid , Mamma , he has no real taste . Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor 's drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . He admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . To satisfy me , those characters must be united . I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . Oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward 's manner in reading to us last night ! I felt for my sister most severely . Yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it . I could hardly keep my seat . To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference!"--
5752	5780	5345	5345	she	90	" He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose . I thought so at the time ; but you WOULD give him Cowper . "
5781	5900	5461	5461	Marianne	92	" Nay , Mamma , if he is not to be animated by Cowper!-- but we must allow for difference of taste . Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him . But it would have broke MY heart , had I loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility . Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love . I require so much ! He must have all Edward 's virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm . "
5901	5954	5345	5345	she	90	" Remember , my love , that you are not seventeen . It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness . Why should you be less fortunate than your mother ? In one circumstance only , my Marianne , may your destiny be different from her 's ! "
5957	5966	5968	5968	Marianne	92	" What a pity it is , Elinor , "
5970	5980	5968	5968	Marianne	92	" that Edward should have no taste for drawing . "
5981	5987	5989	5989	Elinor	91	" No taste for drawing ! "
5991	6105	5989	5989	Elinor	91	" why should you think so ? He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well . He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right . "
6183	6189	6191	6191	Elinor	91	" I hope , Marianne , "
6193	6244	6191	6191	Elinor	91	" you do not consider him as deficient in general taste . Indeed , I think I may say that you can not , for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial , and if THAT were your opinion , I am sure you could never be civil to him . "
6282	6359	6279	6279	she	92	" Do not be offended , Elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits . I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense . I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable . "
6360	6365	6367	6367	Elinor	91	" I am sure , "
6373	6400	6367	6367	Elinor	91	" that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that . I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly . "
6412	6420	6422	6422	Elinor	91	" Of his sense and his goodness , "
6424	6687	6422	6422	Elinor	91	" no one can , I think , be in doubt , who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation . The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well - informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so . What say you , Marianne ? "
6688	6734	6778	6778	she	91	" I shall very soon think him handsome , Elinor , if I do not now . When you tell me to love him as a brother , I shall no more see imperfection in his face , than I now do in his heart . "
6844	6852	6854	6854	she	91	" I do not attempt to deny , "
6856	6875	6854	6854	she	91	" that I think very highly of him -- that I greatly esteem , that I like him . "
6882	6921	6876	6876	Marianne	92	" Esteem him ! Like him ! Cold - hearted Elinor ! Oh ! worse than cold - hearted ! Ashamed of being otherwise . Use those words again , and I will leave the room this moment . "
6928	6932	6934	6934	she	91	" Excuse me , "
6936	7179	6934	6934	she	91	" and be assured that I meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings . Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion -- the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . But farther than this you must not believe . I am by no means assured of his regard for me . There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . In my heart I feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference . But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank . "
7199	7209	7211	7211	she	92	" And you really are not engaged to him ! "
7213	7289	7211	7211	she	92	" Yet it certainly soon will happen . But two advantages will proceed from this delay . I shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . Oh ! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself , how delightful it would be ! "
8348	8371	8372	8372	She	91	" Devonshire ! Are you , indeed , going there ? So far from hence ! And to what part of it ? "
8386	8393	8394	8394	she	91	" It is but a cottage , "
8397	8445	8394	8394	she	91	" but I hope to see many of my friends in it . A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them . "
9236	9242	9244	9244	Marianne	92	" Dear , dear Norland ! "
9263	9372	9247	9247	she	92	" when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh ! happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you , ye well - known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!--No ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!--But who will remain to enjoy you ? "
9885	9896	9898	9898	she	90	" As for the house itself , to be sure , "
9900	10095	9898	9898	she	90	" it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . Perhaps in the spring , if I have plenty of money , as I dare say I shall , we may think about building . These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here ; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . I could wish the stairs were handsome . But one must not expect every thing ; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . I shall see how much I am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly . "
12760	12854	12714	12715	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" But at least , Mamma , you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill - natured . Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings , but he is old enough to be MY father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlived every sensation of the kind . It is too ridiculous ! When is a man to be safe from such wit , if age and infirmity will not protect him ? "
12855	12858	12860	12860	Elinor	91	" Infirmity ! "
12862	12904	12860	12860	Elinor	91	" do you call Colonel Brandon infirm ? I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs ! "
12905	12927	12714	12715	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism ? and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ? "
12928	12933	12935	12936	her mother	347	" My dearest child , "
12940	12975	12935	12936	her mother	347	" at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay ; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty . "
12976	13030	12714	12715	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" Mamma , you are not doing me justice . I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature . He may live twenty years longer . But thirty - five has nothing to do with matrimony . "
13031	13034	13036	13036	Elinor	91	" Perhaps , "
13038	13094	13036	13036	Elinor	91	" thirty - five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together . But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , I should not think Colonel Brandon 's being thirty - five any objection to his marrying HER . "
13095	13103	13105	13105	Marianne	92	" A woman of seven and twenty , "
13112	13233	13105	13105	Marianne	92	" can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife . In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable . It would be a compact of convenience , and the world would be satisfied . In my eyes it would be no marriage at all , but that would be nothing . To me it would seem only a commercial exchange , in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other . "
13234	13243	13245	13245	Elinor	91	" It would be impossible , I know , "
13247	13328	13245	13245	Elinor	91	" to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty - five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her . But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber , merely because he chanced to complain yesterday ( a very cold damp day ) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders . "
13329	13337	13339	13339	Marianne	92	" But he talked of flannel waistcoats , "
13341	13372	13339	13339	Marianne	92	" and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches , cramps , rheumatisms , and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble . "
13373	13419	13105	13105	Marianne	92	" Had he been only in a violent fever , you would not have despised him half so much . Confess , Marianne , is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek , hollow eye , and quick pulse of a fever ? "
13431	13434	13436	13436	Marianne	92	" Mamma , "
13438	13499	13436	13436	Marianne	92	" I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I can not conceal from you . I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well . We have now been here almost a fortnight , and yet he does not come . Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay . What else can detain him at Norland ? "
13500	13511	13513	13514	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" Had you any idea of his coming so soon ? "
13516	13572	13513	13514	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" I had none . On the contrary , if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject , it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation , when I talked of his coming to Barton . Does Elinor expect him already ? "
13573	13588	13339	13339	Marianne	92	" I have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must . "
13589	13641	13513	13514	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" I rather think you are mistaken , for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time . "
13642	13792	13339	13339	Marianne	92	" How strange this is ! what can be the meaning of it ! But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable ! How cold , how composed were their last adieus ! How languid their conversation the last evening of their being together ! In Edward 's farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me : it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both . Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room . And Elinor , in quitting Norland and Edward , cried not as I did . Even now her self - command is invariable . When is she dejected or melancholy ? When does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ? "
14307	14316	14318	14318	Marianne	92	" Is there a felicity in the world , "
14320	14334	14318	14318	Marianne	92	" superior to this?--Margaret , we will walk here at least two hours . "
15140	15143	15145	15146	Sir John	103	" Willoughby ! "
15148	15177	15145	15146	Sir John	103	" what , is HE in the country ? That is good news however ; I will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on Thursday . "
15178	15184	15186	15187	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" You know him then , "
15189	15208	15145	15146	Sir John	103	" Know him ! to be sure I do . Why , he is down here every year . "
15209	15220	15145	15146	Sir John	103	" And what sort of a young man is he ? "
15221	15251	15145	15146	Sir John	103	" As good a kind of fellow as ever lived , I assure you . A very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in England . "
15252	15263	15265	15265	Marianne	92	" And is that all you can say for him ? "
15269	15290	15265	15265	Marianne	92	" But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance ? What his pursuits , his talents , and genius ? "
15297	15302	15304	15304	he	103	" Upon my soul , "
15306	15351	15304	15304	he	103	" I do not know much about him as to all THAT . But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw . Was she out with him today ? "
15381	15387	15389	15389	Elinor	91	" But who is he ? "
15391	15405	15389	15389	Elinor	91	" Where does he come from ? Has he a house at Allenham ? "
15466	15549	15418	15418	he	103	" Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . "
15550	15556	15558	15559	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" I do not believe , "
15567	15646	15558	15559	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him . It is not an employment to which they have been brought up . Men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich . I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . "
15647	15664	15666	15667	Sir John	103	" He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived , "
15669	15695	15666	15667	Sir John	103	" I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o'clock till four , without once sitting down . "
15696	15701	15703	15703	Marianne	92	" Did he indeed ? "
15708	15716	15703	15703	Marianne	92	" and with elegance , with spirit ? "
15717	15732	15558	15559	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . "
15733	15772	15703	15703	Marianne	92	" That is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be . Whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue . "
15773	15785	15787	15788	Sir John	103	" Aye , aye , I see how it will be , "
15790	15815	15787	15788	Sir John	103	" I see how it will be . You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon . "
15816	15825	15827	15827	Marianne	92	" That is an expression , Sir John , "
15831	15901	15827	15827	Marianne	92	" which I particularly dislike . I abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is intended ; and ' setting one 's cap at a man , ' or ' making a conquest , ' are the most odious of all . Their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity . "
15925	15980	15912	15912	he	103	" Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other . Poor Brandon ! he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles . "
16539	16544	16546	16546	Elinor	91	" Well , Marianne , "
16556	16676	16546	16546	Elinor	91	" for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well . You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby 's opinion in almost every matter of importance . You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott ; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought , and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper . But how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ? You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic . Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask . "--
16677	16680	16682	16682	Marianne	92	" Elinor , "
16684	16782	16682	16682	Marianne	92	" is this fair ? is this just ? are my ideas so scanty ? But I see what you mean . I have been too much at my ease , too happy , too frank . I have erred against every common - place notion of decorum ; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved , spiritless , dull , and deceitful -- had I talked only of the weather and the roads , and had I spoken only once in ten minutes , this reproach would have been spared . "
16783	16787	16789	16790	her mother	347	" My love , "
16792	16831	16789	16790	her mother	347	" you must not be offended with Elinor -- she was only in jest . I should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend . "--
17614	17623	17625	17625	Willoughby	110	" Brandon is just the kind of man , "
17637	17664	17625	17625	Willoughby	110	" whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to . "
17665	17675	17677	17677	Marianne	92	" That is exactly what I think of him , "
17679	17688	17690	17690	Elinor	91	" Do not boast of it , however , "
17692	17728	17690	17690	Elinor	91	" for it is injustice in both of you . He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him . "
17729	17737	17739	17739	Willoughby	110	" That he is patronised by YOU , "
17741	17794	17739	17739	Willoughby	110	" is certainly in his favour ; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself . Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings , that could command the indifference of any body else ? "
17795	17846	17690	17690	Elinor	91	" But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother . If their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust . "
17847	17859	17739	17739	Willoughby	110	" In defence of your protege you can even be saucy . "
17860	17950	17690	17690	Elinor	91	" My protege , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me . Yes , Marianne , even in a man between thirty and forty . He has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind . I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature . "
17951	17957	17959	17959	Marianne	92	" That is to say , "
17962	17984	17959	17959	Marianne	92	" he has told you , that in the East Indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome . "
17985	18018	17690	17690	Elinor	91	" He WOULD have told me so , I doubt not , had I made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed . "
18019	18022	18024	18024	Willoughby	110	" Perhaps , "
18026	18044	18024	18024	Willoughby	110	" his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins . "
18045	18069	17690	17690	Elinor	91	" I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour . But why should you dislike him ? "
18070	18130	18024	18024	Willoughby	110	" I do not dislike him . I consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body 's good word , and nobody 's notice ; who , has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year . "
18131	18136	18138	18138	Marianne	92	" Add to which , "
18140	18170	18138	18138	Marianne	92	" that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . That his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression . "
18171	18183	18185	18185	Elinor	91	" You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , "
18187	18248	18185	18185	Elinor	91	" and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid . I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , I believe , possessing an amiable heart . "
18249	18253	18255	18255	Willoughby	110	" Miss Dashwood , "
18257	18409	18255	18255	Willoughby	110	" you are now using me unkindly . You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will . But it will not do . You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful . I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon ; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and I can not persuade him to buy my brown mare . If it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable , I am ready to confess it . And in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you can not deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever . "
19469	19483	19461	19461	he	108	" Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments . "
19484	19487	19489	19489	Elinor	91	" No , "
19491	19498	19461	19461	he	108	" her opinions are all romantic . "
19499	19514	19461	19461	he	108	" Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist . "
19515	19587	19461	19461	he	108	" I believe she does . But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , I know not . A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . "
19588	19596	19597	19597	he	108	" This will probably be the case , "
19600	19633	19597	19597	he	108	" and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions . "
19634	19643	19645	19645	Elinor	91	" I can not agree with you there , "
19647	19706	19645	19645	Elinor	91	" There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne 's , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . "
19717	19777	19711	19711	he	108	" Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? "
19778	19814	19711	19711	he	108	" Upon my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment 's being pardonable . "
19815	19818	19820	19820	he	108	" This , "
19822	19918	19820	19820	he	108	" can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments -- No , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! I speak from experience . I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an inforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances"--
20211	20224	20225	20225	she	340	" He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it , "
20228	20266	20225	20225	she	340	" and when it arrives we will ride every day . You shall share its use with me . Imagine to yourself , my dear Elinor , the delight of a gallop on some of these downs . "
20386	20393	20395	20395	she	91	" You are mistaken , Elinor , "
20398	20526	20395	20395	she	91	" in supposing I know very little of Willoughby . I have not known him long indeed , but I am much better acquainted with him , than I am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;-- it is disposition alone . Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from Willoughby . Of John I know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed . "
20731	20781	20724	20724	he	110	voice,--"But , Marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . I shall keep it only till you can claim it . When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , Queen Mab shall receive you . "
20958	20963	20964	20964	she	93	" Oh , Elinor ! "
20967	20992	20964	20964	she	93	" I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne . I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon . "
20993	20999	21001	21001	Elinor	91	" You have said so , "
21003	21057	21001	21001	Elinor	91	" almost every day since they first met on High - church Down ; and they had not known each other a week , I believe , before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle . "
21058	21087	20964	20964	she	93	" But indeed this is quite another thing . I am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair . "
21088	21107	21001	21001	Elinor	91	" Take care , Margaret . It may be only the hair of some great uncle of HIS . "
21108	21223	20964	20964	she	93	" But , indeed , Elinor , it is Marianne 's . I am almost sure it is , for I saw him cut it off . Last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket - book . "
21328	21339	21317	21317	Margaret	93	" I must not tell , may I , Elinor ? "
21419	21436	21396	21396	she	92	" Remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them . "
21437	21446	21448	21448	Margaret	93	" I never had any conjectures about it , "
21450	21461	21448	21448	Margaret	93	" it was you who told me of it yourself . "
21480	21495	21497	21498	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Oh ! pray , Miss Margaret , let us know all about it , "
21500	21508	21497	21498	Mrs. Jennings	107	" What is the gentleman 's name ? "
21509	21534	21396	21396	she	92	" I must not tell , ma'am . But I know very well what it is ; and I know where he is too . "
21535	21568	21497	21498	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at Norland to be sure . He is the curate of the parish I dare say . "
21569	21585	21396	21396	she	92	" No , THAT he is not . He is of no profession at all . "
21586	21589	21591	21591	Marianne	92	" Margaret , "
21596	21619	21591	21591	Marianne	92	" you know that all this is an invention of your own , and that there is no such person in existence . "
21620	21650	21396	21396	she	92	" Well , then , he is lately dead , Marianne , for I am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an F. "
21666	21673	21396	21396	she	92	" that it rained very hard , "
22178	22186	22188	22189	Sir John	103	" What is the matter with Brandon ? "
22195	22205	22207	22208	Lady Middleton	104	" I hope he has had no bad news , "
22210	22228	22207	22208	Lady Middleton	104	" It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly . "
22236	22246	22248	22249	Mrs. Jennings	107	" No bad news , Colonel , I hope ; "
22259	22270	22207	22208	Lady Middleton	104	" None at all , ma'am , I thank you . "
22271	22290	22207	22208	Lady Middleton	104	" Was it from Avignon ? I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse . "
22291	22309	22207	22208	Lady Middleton	104	" No , ma'am . It came from town , and is merely a letter of business . "
22310	22351	22207	22208	Lady Middleton	104	" But how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ? Come , come , this wo n't do , Colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it . "
22352	22357	22359	22360	Lady Middleton	104	" My dear madam , "
22362	22369	22359	22360	Lady Middleton	104	" recollect what you are saying . "
22370	22384	22386	22387	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married ? "
22397	22406	22207	22208	Lady Middleton	104	" No , indeed , it is not . "
22407	22428	22359	22360	Lady Middleton	104	" Well , then , I know who it is from , Colonel . And I hope she is well . "
22429	22437	22439	22439	he	889	" Whom do you mean , ma'am ? "
22445	22454	22359	22360	Lady Middleton	104	" Oh ! you know who I mean . "
22455	22463	22465	22465	he	889	" I am particularly sorry , ma'am , "
22471	22493	22465	22465	he	889	" that I should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town . "
22494	22498	22500	22501	Mrs. Jennings	107	" In town ! "
22503	22518	22500	22501	Mrs. Jennings	107	" What can you have to do in town at this time of year ? "
22519	22526	22527	22527	be	890	" My own loss is great , "
22530	22562	22527	22527	be	890	" in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ; but I am the more concerned , as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell . "
22572	22586	22588	22588	Marianne	92	" But if you write a note to the housekeeper , Mr. Brandon , "
22592	22599	22588	22588	Marianne	92	" will it not be sufficient ? "
22605	22610	22612	22613	Sir John.--"It	103	" We must go , "
22613	22641	22612	22613	Sir John.--"It	103	John.--"It shall not be put off when we are so near it . You can not go to town till tomorrow , Brandon , that is all . "
22642	22667	22612	22613	Sir John.--"It	103	" I wish it could be so easily settled . But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day ! "
22668	22681	22683	22684	Mrs. Jennings	107	" If you would but let us know what your business is , "
22686	22699	22683	22684	Mrs. Jennings	107	" we might see whether it could be put off or not . "
22700	22709	22711	22711	Willoughby	110	" You would not be six hours later , "
22713	22725	22711	22711	Willoughby	110	" if you were to defer your journey till our return . "
22726	22736	22612	22613	Sir John.--"It	103	" I can not afford to lose ONE hour . "--
22750	22803	22740	22740	Willoughby	110	" There are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . Brandon is one of them . He was afraid of catching cold I dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it . I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing . "
22804	22812	22814	22814	Marianne	92	" I have no doubt of it , "
22816	22834	22836	22837	Sir John	103	" There is no persuading you to change your mind , Brandon , I know of old , "
22839	22903	22836	22837	Sir John	103	" when once you are determined on anything . But , however , I hope you will think better of it . Consider , here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton , the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to Whitwell . "
22930	22942	22908	22908	his	108	" Well , then , when will you come back again ? "
22943	22953	22955	22956	her ladyship	583	" I hope we shall see you at Barton , "
22958	22981	22955	22956	her ladyship	583	" as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return . "
22982	23015	22908	22908	his	108	" You are very obliging . But it is so uncertain , when I may have it in my power to return , that I dare not engage for it at all . "
23016	23026	23028	23029	Sir John	103	" Oh ! he must and shall come back , "
23031	23050	23028	23029	Sir John	103	" If he is not here by the end of the week , I shall go after him . "
23051	23060	23062	23063	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Ay , so do , Sir John , "
23065	23078	23062	23063	Mrs. Jennings	107	" and then perhaps you may find out what his business is . "
23079	23102	22908	22908	his	108	" I do not want to pry into other men 's concerns . I suppose it is something he is ashamed of . "
23110	23123	23125	23126	Sir John	103	" You do not go to town on horseback , do you ? "
23128	23141	23028	23029	Sir John	103	" No . Only to Honiton . I shall then go post . "
23142	23167	23062	23063	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Well , as you are resolved to go , I wish you a good journey . But you had better change your mind . "
23168	23179	23028	23029	Sir John	103	" I assure you it is not in my power . "
23189	23209	23062	23063	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? "
23210	23219	23062	23063	Mrs. Jennings	107	" I am afraid , none at all . "
23220	23238	23062	23063	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do . "
23249	23253	23255	23256	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Come Colonel , "
23258	23273	23255	23256	Mrs. Jennings	107	" before you go , do let us know what you are going about . "
23323	23334	23336	23337	Mrs. Jennings	107	" I can guess what his business is , however , "
23340	23346	23348	23350	almost every body	899	" Can you , ma'am ? "
23352	23365	23436	23436	her	92	" Yes ; it is about Miss Williams , I am sure . "
23366	23373	23375	23375	Marianne	92	" And who is Miss Williams ? "
23377	23432	23441	23441	she	92	" What ! do not you know who Miss Williams is ? I am sure you must have heard of her before . She is a relation of the Colonel 's , my dear ; a very near relation . We will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies . "
23446	23453	23441	23441	she	92	" She is his natural daughter . "
23454	23457	23436	23436	her	92	" Indeed ! "
23458	23484	23436	23436	her	92	" Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune . "
23757	23778	23737	23737	she	107	" I have found you out in spite of all your tricks . I know where you spent the morning . "
23787	23790	23779	23779	Marianne	92	" Where , pray?"--
23791	23797	23799	23799	Willoughby	110	" Did not you know , "
23801	23811	23799	23799	Willoughby	110	" that we had been out in my curricle ? "
23812	23890	23779	23779	Marianne	92	" Yes , yes , Mr. Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne . It is a very large one , I know ; and when I come to see you , I hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago . "
24054	24090	24044	24044	Marianne	92	" Why should you imagine , Elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ? "
24091	24116	24031	24031	she	91	" Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby . "
24117	24163	24044	24044	Marianne	92	" Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . "
24164	24169	24171	24171	Elinor	91	" I am afraid , "
24173	24187	24171	24171	Elinor	91	" that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . "
24188	24250	24044	24044	Marianne	92	" On the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , Elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did , I should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure . "
24251	24284	24171	24171	Elinor	91	" But , my dear Marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ? "
24285	24360	24044	24044	Marianne	92	" If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives . I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation . I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith 's grounds , or in seeing her house . They will one day be Mr. Willoughby 's , and-- "
24361	24385	24171	24171	Elinor	91	" If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . "
24426	24603	24412	24412	she	918	" Perhaps , Elinor , it WAS rather ill - judged in me to go to Allenham ; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place ; and it is a charming house , I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . It is a corner room , and has windows on two sides . On one side you look across the bowling - green , behind the house , to a beautiful hanging wood , and on the other you have a view of the church and village , and , beyond them , of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired . I did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up -- a couple of hundred pounds , Willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in England . "
24744	24757	24759	24759	she	107	" Something very melancholy must be the matter , I am sure , "
24761	25001	24759	24759	she	107	" I could see it in his face . Poor man ! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad . The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year , and his brother left everything sadly involved . I do think he must have been sent for about money matters , for what else can it be ? I wonder whether it is so . I would give anything to know the truth of it . Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and , by the bye , I dare say it is , because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her . May be she is ill in town ; nothing in the world more likely , for I have a notion she is always rather sickly . I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams . It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances NOW , for he is a very prudent man , and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time . I wonder what it can be ! May be his sister is worse at Avignon , and has sent for him over . His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it . Well , I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart , and a good wife into the bargain . "
25504	25507	25508	25508	he	110	" What ! "
25509	25546	25487	25487	he	110	exclaimed--"Improve this dear cottage ! No . THAT I will never consent to . Not a stone must be added to its walls , not an inch to its size , if my feelings are regarded . "
25547	25553	25555	25556	Miss Dashwood	86	" Do not be alarmed , "
25558	25579	25555	25556	Miss Dashwood	86	" nothing of the kind will be done ; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it . "
25580	25588	25589	25589	he	110	" I am heartily glad of it , "
25592	25608	25589	25589	he	110	" May she always be poor , if she can employ her riches no better . "
25609	25706	25487	25487	he	110	" Thank you , Willoughby . But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours , or of any one whom I loved , for all the improvements in the world . Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain , when I make up my accounts in the spring , I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you . But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it ? "
25707	25711	25713	25713	he	110	" I am , "
25715	25766	25713	25713	he	110	" To me it is faultless . Nay , more , I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable , and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down , and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage . "
25767	25781	25783	25783	Elinor	91	" With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes , I suppose , "
25785	25788	25790	25790	he	110	" Yes , "
25797	25847	25790	25790	he	110	" with all and every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience or INconvenience about it , should the least variation be perceptible . Then , and then only , under such a roof , I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton . "
25848	25853	25855	25855	Elinor	91	" I flatter myself , "
25857	25886	25855	25855	Elinor	91	" that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase , you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this . "
25887	25893	25895	25895	Willoughby	110	" There certainly are circumstances , "
25897	25925	25895	25895	Willoughby	110	" which might greatly endear it to me ; but this place will always have one claim of my affection , which no other can possibly share . "
25953	25960	25962	25962	he	110	" How often did I wish , "
25964	26077	25962	25962	he	110	" when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth , that Barton cottage were inhabited ! I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation , and grieving that no one should live in it . How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs. Smith , when I next came into the country , would be that Barton cottage was taken : and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event , which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it , can account for . Must it not have been so , Marianne ? "
26095	26192	26092	26092	he	110	" And yet this house you would spoil , Mrs. Dashwood ? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement ! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began , and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together , you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance , and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford . "
26208	26215	26216	26216	he	110	" You are a good woman , "
26220	26289	26216	26216	he	110	" Your promise makes me easy . Extend it a little farther , and it will make me happy . Tell me that not only your house will remain the same , but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling ; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me . "
26314	26323	26325	26326	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner ? "
26334	26360	26325	26326	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" I do not ask you to come in the morning , for we must walk to the park , to call on Lady Middleton . "
26598	26606	26608	26609	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" Is anything the matter with her ? "
26612	26616	26611	26611	she	90	entered--"is she ill ? "
26617	26622	26623	26623	he	110	" I hope not , "
26639	26662	26623	26623	he	110	" It is I who may rather expect to be ill -- for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment ! "
26663	26666	26611	26611	she	90	" Disappointment ? "
26667	26735	26623	26623	he	110	" Yes , for I am unable to keep my engagement with you . Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin , by sending me on business to London . I have just received my dispatches , and taken my farewell of Allenham ; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you . "
26736	26745	26611	26611	she	90	" To London!--and are you going this morning ? "
26746	26751	26623	26623	he	110	" Almost this moment . "
26752	26776	26611	26611	she	90	" This is very unfortunate . But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from us long I hope . "
26783	26812	26777	26777	He	958	" You are very kind , but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately . My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth . "
26813	26850	26851	26851	His	958	" And is Mrs. Smith your only friend ? Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome ? For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ? "
26867	26873	26863	26863	he	958	" You are too good . "
26901	26968	26896	26897	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" I have only to add , my dear Willoughby , that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for I will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith ; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination . "
26969	26975	26977	26977	Willoughby	110	" My engagements at present , "
26981	26994	26977	26977	Willoughby	110	" are of such a nature -- that -- I dare not flatter myself"--
27025	27057	27016	27016	Willoughby	110	" It is folly to linger in this manner . I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy . "
27330	27343	27345	27345	she	347	" Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton , Elinor , "
27354	27365	27345	27345	she	347	" and with how heavy a heart does he travel ? "
27366	27474	27313	27314	her mother	347	" It is all very strange . So suddenly to be gone ! It seems but the work of a moment . And last night he was with us so happy , so cheerful , so affectionate ? And now , after only ten minutes notice -- Gone too without intending to return!--Something more than what be owned to us must have happened . He did not speak , he did not behave like himself . YOU must have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be ? Can they have quarrelled ? Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?"--
27475	27532	27345	27345	she	347	" It was not inclination that he wanted , Elinor ; I could plainly see THAT . He had not the power of accepting it . I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you . "
27533	27539	27313	27314	her mother	347	" Can you , indeed ! "
27540	27760	27345	27345	she	347	" Yes . I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--but you , Elinor , who love to doubt where you can -- it will not satisfy YOU , I know ; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it . I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him , ) and on that account is eager to get him away;-- and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him . This is what I believe to have happened . He is , moreover , aware that she DOES disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from Devonshire for a while . You will tell me , I know , that this may or may NOT have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this . And now , Elinor , what have you to say ? "
27761	27771	27313	27314	her mother	347	" Nothing , for you have anticipated my answer . "
27772	27943	27345	27345	she	347	" Then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened . Oh , Elinor , how incomprehensible are your feelings ! You had rather take evil upon credit than good . You had rather look out for misery for Marianne , and guilt for poor Willoughby , than an apology for the latter . You are resolved to think him blameable , because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn . And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ? Are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ? Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love , and no reason in the world to think ill of ? To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves , though unavoidably secret for a while ? And , after all , what is it you suspect him of ? "
27944	28062	27313	27314	her mother	347	" I can hardly tell myself . But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him . There is great truth , however , in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him , and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body . Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct , and I will hope that he has . But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once . Secrecy may be advisable ; but still I can not help wondering at its being practiced by him . "
28063	28106	27345	27345	she	347	" Do not blame him , however , for departing from his character , where the deviation is necessary . But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence?--I am happy -- and he is acquitted . "
28107	28163	27313	27314	her mother	347	" Not entirely . It may be proper to conceal their engagement ( if they ARE engaged ) from Mrs. Smith-- and if that is the case , it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present . But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us . "
28164	28200	27345	27345	she	347	" Concealing it from us ! my dear child , do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment ? This is strange indeed , when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness . "
28201	28210	28212	28212	Elinor	91	" I want no proof of their affection , "
28214	28222	28212	28212	Elinor	91	" but of their engagement I do . "
28223	28231	27345	27345	she	347	" I am perfectly satisfied of both . "
28232	28251	28212	28212	Elinor	91	" Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject , by either of them . "
28252	28404	27345	27345	she	347	" I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly . Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us , for at least the last fortnight , declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife , and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation ? Have we not perfectly understood each other ? Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks , his manner , his attentive and affectionate respect ? My Elinor , is it possible to doubt their engagement ? How could such a thought occur to you ? How is it to be supposed that Willoughby , persuaded as he must be of your sister 's love , should leave her , and leave her perhaps for months , without telling her of his affection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence ? "
28405	28409	28411	28411	Elinor	91	" I confess , "
28413	28448	28411	28411	Elinor	91	" that every circumstance except ONE is in favour of their engagement ; but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject , and with me it almost outweighs every other . "
28449	28513	27345	27345	she	347	" How strange this is ! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby , if , after all that has openly passed between them , you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together . Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time ? Do you suppose him really indifferent to her ? "
28514	28533	28411	28411	Elinor	91	" No , I can not think that . He must and does love her I am sure . "
28534	28564	27345	27345	she	347	" But with a strange kind of tenderness , if he can leave her with such indifference , such carelessness of the future , as you attribute to him . "
28565	28624	28411	28411	Elinor	91	" You must remember , my dear mother , that I have never considered this matter as certain . I have had my doubts , I confess ; but they are fainter than they were , and they may soon be entirely done away . If we find they correspond , every fear of mine will be removed . "
28625	28734	27345	27345	she	347	" A mighty concession indeed ! If you were to see them at the altar , you would suppose they were going to be married . Ungracious girl ! But I require no such proof . Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt ; no secrecy has been attempted ; all has been uniformly open and unreserved . You can not doubt your sister 's wishes . It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect . But why ? Is he not a man of honour and feeling ? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm ? can he be deceitful ? "
28735	28744	28746	28746	Elinor	91	" I hope not , I believe not , "
28748	28986	28746	28746	Elinor	91	" I love Willoughby , sincerely love him ; and suspicion of his integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me . It has been involuntary , and I will not encourage it . I was startled , I confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality . But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed . He had just parted from my sister , had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction ; and if he felt obliged , from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith , to resist the temptation of returning here soon , and yet aware that by declining your invitation , by saying that he was going away for some time , he should seem to act an ungenerous , a suspicious part by our family , be might well be embarrassed and disturbed . In such a case , a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think , as well as more consistent with his general character;--but I will not raise objections against any one 's conduct on so illiberal a foundation , as a difference in judgment from myself , or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent . "
28987	29108	29152	29152	Marianne	92	" You speak very properly . Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected . Though WE have not known him long , he is no stranger in this part of the world ; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage ? Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately , it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once : but this is not the case . It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun , for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance ; and even secrecy , as far as it can be observed , may now be very advisable . "
29733	29738	29740	29740	she	90	" Remember , Elinor , "
29742	29794	29740	29740	she	90	" how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post , and carries them to it . We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary , and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through Sir John 's hands . "
29862	29872	29874	29874	she	91	" Why do you not ask Marianne at once , "
29876	29935	29874	29874	she	91	" whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby ? From you , her mother , and so kind , so indulgent a mother , the question could not give offence . It would be the natural result of your affection for her . She used to be all unreserve , and to you more especially . "
29936	30074	30075	30075	Elinor	91	" I would not ask such a question for the world . Supposing it possible that they are not engaged , what distress would not such an enquiry inflict ! At any rate it would be most ungenerous . I should never deserve her confidence again , after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one . I know Marianne 's heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible . I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct . "
30173	30218	30160	30161	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" We have never finished Hamlet , Marianne ; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it . We will put it by , that when he comes again ... But it may be months , perhaps , before THAT happens . "
30219	30222	30224	30224	Marianne	92	" Months ! "
30230	30237	30224	30224	Marianne	92	" No -- nor many weeks . "
30551	30561	30547	30547	Marianne	92	" It is he ; it is indeed;--I know it is!"--and
30573	30604	30569	30569	Elinor	91	" Indeed , Marianne , I think you are mistaken . It is not Willoughby . The person is not tall enough for him , and has not his air . "
30605	30612	30614	30614	Marianne	92	" He has , he has , "
30616	30640	30614	30614	Marianne	92	" I am sure he has . His air , his coat , his horse . I knew how soon he would come . "
31051	31055	31056	31056	she	92	" A fortnight ! "
31095	31103	31105	31105	Elinor	91	" Have you been lately in Sussex ? "
31107	31117	31076	31076	He	96	" I was at Norland about a month ago . "
31118	31128	31130	31130	Marianne	92	" And how does dear , dear Norland look ? "
31132	31138	31140	31140	Elinor	91	" Dear , dear Norland , "
31142	31167	31140	31140	Elinor	91	" probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year . The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves . "
31168	31171	31173	31173	Marianne	92	" Oh , "
31175	31252	31173	31173	Marianne	92	" with what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall ! How have I delighted , as I walked , to see them driven in showers about me by the wind ! What feelings have they , the season , the air altogether inspired ! Now there is no one to regard them . They are seen only as a nuisance , swept hastily off , and driven as much as possible from the sight . "
31253	31260	31262	31262	Elinor	91	" It is not every one , "
31264	31273	31262	31262	Elinor	91	" who has your passion for dead leaves . "
31274	31293	31294	31294	she	92	" No ; my feelings are not often shared , not often understood . But SOMETIMES they are . "--As
31311	31316	31318	31318	she	92	" Now , Edward , "
31327	31397	31318	31318	she	92	" here is Barton valley . Look up to it , and be tranquil if you can . Look at those hills ! Did you ever see their equals ? To the left is Barton park , amongst those woods and plantations . You may see the end of the house . And there , beneath that farthest hill , which rises with such grandeur , is our cottage . "
31398	31405	31406	31406	he	1026	" It is a beautiful country , "
31409	31419	31406	31406	he	1026	" but these bottoms must be dirty in winter . "
31420	31434	31318	31318	she	92	" How can you think of dirt , with such objects before you ? "
31435	31438	31440	31440	he	1026	" Because , "
31444	31461	31440	31440	he	1026	" among the rest of the objects before me , I see a very dirty lane . "
31462	31466	31470	31470	herself	92	" How strange ! "
31476	31490	31440	31440	he	1026	" Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here ? Are the Middletons pleasant people ? "
31491	31497	31499	31499	Marianne	92	" No , not all , "
31501	31510	31499	31499	Marianne	92	" we could not be more unfortunately situated . "
31511	31514	31516	31517	her sister	351	" Marianne , "
31519	31569	31516	31517	her sister	351	" how can you say so ? How can you be so unjust ? They are a very respectable family , Mr. Ferrars ; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner . Have you forgot , Marianne , how many pleasant days we have owed to them ? "
31570	31573	31575	31575	Marianne	92	" No , "
31582	31589	31575	31575	Marianne	92	" nor how many painful moments . "
31898	31912	31914	31914	she	90	" What are Mrs. Ferrars 's views for you at present , Edward ? "
31928	31942	31914	31914	she	90	" are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself ? "
31943	31966	32130	32130	Marianne	92	" No . I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life ! "
31967	32015	31914	31914	she	90	" But how is your fame to be established ? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family ; and with no inclination for expense , no affection for strangers , no profession , and no assurance , you may find it a difficult matter . "
32016	32054	32130	32130	Marianne	92	" I shall not attempt it . I have no wish to be distinguished ; and have every reason to hope I never shall . Thank Heaven ! I can not be forced into genius and eloquence . "
32055	32071	31914	31914	she	90	" You have no ambition , I well know . Your wishes are all moderate . "
32072	32121	32130	32130	Marianne	92	" As moderate as those of the rest of the world , I believe . I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy ; but , like every body else it must be in my own way . Greatness will not make me so . "
32122	32128	32130	32130	Marianne	92	" Strange that it would ! "
32132	32143	32130	32130	Marianne	92	" What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness ? "
32144	32150	32152	32152	Elinor	91	" Grandeur has but little , "
32154	32164	32152	32152	Elinor	91	" but wealth has much to do with it . "
32165	32171	32173	32173	Marianne	92	" Elinor , for shame ! "
32175	32209	32173	32173	Marianne	92	" money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it . Beyond a competence , it can afford no real satisfaction , as far as mere self is concerned . "
32210	32213	32215	32215	Elinor	91	" Perhaps , "
32219	32282	32215	32215	Elinor	91	" we may come to the same point . YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ? "
32283	32298	32385	32385	Elinor	91	" About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year ; not more than THAT . "
32302	32320	32299	32299	Elinor	91	" TWO thousand a year ! ONE is my wealth ! I guessed how it would end . "
32321	32335	32337	32337	Marianne	92	" And yet two thousand a - year is a very moderate income , "
32339	32384	32337	32337	Marianne	92	" A family can not well be maintained on a smaller . I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands . A proper establishment of servants , a carriage , perhaps two , and hunters , can not be supported on less . "
32403	32406	32385	32385	Elinor	91	" Hunters ! "
32408	32421	32422	32422	Marianne	92	Edward--"but why must you have hunters ? Every body does not hunt . "
32428	32434	32422	32422	Marianne	92	" But most people do . "
32435	32439	32441	32441	Margaret	93	" I wish , "
32449	32461	32441	32441	Margaret	93	" that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece ! "
32462	32468	32470	32470	Marianne	92	" Oh that they would ! "
32490	32502	32504	32504	Elinor	91	" We are all unanimous in that wish , I suppose , "
32506	32515	32504	32504	Elinor	91	" in spite of the insufficiency of wealth . "
32516	32520	32522	32522	Margaret	93	" Oh dear ! "
32524	32540	32522	32522	Margaret	93	" how happy I should be ! I wonder what I should do with it ! "
32553	32566	32568	32569	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself , "
32571	32583	32568	32569	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" if my children were all to be rich my help . "
32584	32594	32596	32596	Elinor	91	" You must begin your improvements on this house , "
32598	32606	32596	32596	Elinor	91	" and your difficulties will soon vanish . "
32607	32619	32621	32621	Edward	96	" What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London , "
32623	32773	32621	32621	Edward	96	" in such an event ! What a happy day for booksellers , music - sellers , and print - shops ! You , Miss Dashwood , would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you -- and as for Marianne , I know her greatness of soul , there would not be music enough in London to content her . And books!--Thomson , Cowper , Scott -- she would buy them all over and over again : she would buy up every copy , I believe , to prevent their falling into unworthy hands ; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree . Should not you , Marianne ? Forgive me , if I am very saucy . But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old disputes . "
32774	32847	32568	32569	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" I love to be reminded of the past , Edward -- whether it be melancholy or gay , I love to recall it -- and you will never offend me by talking of former times . You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent -- some of it , at least -- my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books . "
32848	32868	32621	32621	Edward	96	" And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs . "
32869	32884	32568	32569	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" No , Edward , I should have something else to do with it . "
32885	32936	32621	32621	Edward	96	" Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life -- your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ? "
32937	32967	32568	32569	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" Undoubtedly . At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed . It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them . "
32968	32979	32981	32981	Elinor	91	" Marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see , "
32983	32991	32981	32981	Elinor	91	" she is not at all altered . "
32992	33005	32568	32569	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" She is only grown a little more grave than she was . "
33006	33011	33013	33013	Marianne	92	" Nay , Edward , "
33015	33029	33013	33013	Marianne	92	" you need not reproach me . You are not very gay yourself . "
33030	33037	33039	33039	he	1042	" Why should you think so ! "
33045	33056	33039	33039	he	1042	" But gaiety never was a part of MY character . "
33057	33069	33071	33071	Elinor	91	" Nor do I think it a part of Marianne 's , "
33073	33113	33071	33071	Elinor	91	" I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest , very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry . "
33114	33121	33122	33122	he	1042	" I believe you are right , "
33125	33139	33122	33122	he	1042	" and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl . "
33140	33152	33154	33154	Elinor	91	" I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes , "
33156	33231	33154	33154	Elinor	91	" in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated . Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves , and very frequently by what other people say of them , without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge . "
33232	33242	33244	33244	Marianne	92	" But I thought it was right , Elinor , "
33246	33285	33244	33244	Marianne	92	" to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people . I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours . This has always been your doctrine , I am sure . "
33286	33366	33154	33154	Elinor	91	" No , Marianne , never . My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding . All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour . You must not confound my meaning . I am guilty , I confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ? "
33367	33385	33387	33387	Edward	96	" You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility , "
33391	33398	33387	33387	Edward	96	" Do you gain no ground ? "
33399	33404	33406	33406	Elinor	91	" Quite the contrary , "
33413	33417	33418	33418	he	96	" My judgment , "
33421	33506	33418	33418	he	96	" is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister 's . I never wish to offend , but I am so foolishly shy , that I often seem negligent , when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness . I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company , I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility ! "
33507	33519	33521	33521	Elinor	91	" Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers , "
33523	33535	33537	33537	Edward	96	" She knows her own worth too well for false shame , "
33539	33576	33537	33537	Edward	96	" Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other . If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful , I should not be shy . "
33577	33585	33587	33587	Marianne	92	" But you would still be reserved , "
33589	33595	33587	33587	Marianne	92	" and that is worse . "
33597	33605	33537	33537	Edward	96	started--"Reserved ! Am I reserved , Marianne ? "
33606	33611	33596	33596	Edward	96	" Yes , very . "
33612	33619	33621	33621	he	96	" I do not understand you , "
33625	33644	33621	33621	he	96	" Reserved!--how , in what manner ? What am I to tell you ? What can you suppose ? "
33665	33706	33660	33660	she	91	" Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ? Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ? "
33905	33917	33901	33901	himself	96	" I am going into the village to see my horses , "
33921	33938	33901	33901	himself	96	" as you are not yet ready for breakfast ; I shall be back again presently . "
34045	34251	34039	34039	Edward	96	" You must not enquire too far , Marianne -- remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque , and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars . I shall call hills steep , which ought to be bold ; surfaces strange and uncouth , which ought to be irregular and rugged ; and distant objects out of sight , which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere . You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give . I call it a very fine country -- the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and the valley looks comfortable and snug -- with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there . It exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility -- and I dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me . I know nothing of the picturesque . "
34252	34262	34264	34264	Marianne	92	" I am afraid it is but too true , "
34266	34275	34264	34264	Marianne	92	" but why should you boast of it ? "
34276	34280	34282	34282	Elinor	91	" I suspect , "
34284	34352	34282	34282	Elinor	91	" that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another . Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses . He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own . "
34353	34359	34361	34361	Marianne	92	" It is very true , "
34363	34439	34361	34361	Marianne	92	" that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon . Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was . I detest jargon of every kind , and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself , because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning . "
34440	34445	34447	34447	Edward	96	" I am convinced , "
34449	34580	34447	34447	Edward	96	" that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel . But , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess . I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles . I do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees . I admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing . I do not like ruined , tattered cottages . I am not fond of nettles or thistles , or heath blossoms . I have more pleasure in a snug farm - house than a watch - tower -- and a troop of tidy , happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world . "
34666	34678	34679	34679	she	92	" I never saw you wear a ring before , Edward , "
34682	34709	34679	34679	she	92	" Is that Fanny 's hair ? I remember her promising to give you some . But I should have thought her hair had been darker . "
34758	34781	34743	34743	He	96	" Yes ; it is my sister 's hair . The setting always casts a different shade on it , you know . "
35155	35165	35167	35167	he	103	" You MUST drink tea with us to night , "
35169	35194	35167	35167	he	103	" for we shall be quite alone -- and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us , for we shall be a large party . "
35201	35212	35214	35214	she	107	" And who knows but you may raise a dance , "
35216	35226	35214	35214	she	107	" And that will tempt YOU , Miss Marianne . "
35227	35231	35233	35233	Marianne	92	" A dance ! "
35235	35243	35233	35233	Marianne	92	" Impossible ! Who is to dance ? "
35244	35276	35214	35214	she	107	" Who ! why yourselves , and the Careys , and Whitakers to be sure.--What ! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone ! "
35277	35285	35287	35288	Sir John	103	" I wish with all my soul , "
35290	35298	35287	35288	Sir John	103	" that Willoughby were among us again . "
35312	35318	35320	35320	he	103	" And who is Willoughby ? "
35396	35409	35383	35383	he	96	" I have been guessing . Shall I tell you my guess ? "
35410	35416	35383	35383	he	96	" What do you mean ? "
35417	35423	35383	35383	he	96	" Shall I tell you . "
35424	35427	35383	35383	he	96	" Certainly . "
35428	35439	35383	35383	he	96	" Well then ; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts . "
35469	35492	35447	35447	she	92	" Oh , Edward ! How can you?--But the time will come I hope ... I am sure you will like him . "
35493	35500	35502	35502	he	96	" I do not doubt it , "
36085	36091	36093	36094	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" I think , Edward , "
36105	36186	36093	36094	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions . Some inconvenience to your friends , indeed , might result from it -- you would not be able to give them so much of your time . But ( with a smile ) you would be materially benefited in one particular at least -- you would know where to go when you left them . "
36187	36193	36194	36194	he	96	" I do assure you , "
36197	36510	36194	36194	he	96	" that I have long thought on this point , as you think now . It has been , and is , and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me , that I have had no necessary business to engage me , no profession to give me employment , or afford me any thing like independence . But unfortunately my own nicety , and the nicety of my friends , have made me what I am , an idle , helpless being . We never could agree in our choice of a profession . I always preferred the church , as I still do . But that was not smart enough for my family . They recommended the army . That was a great deal too smart for me . The law was allowed to be genteel enough ; many young men , who had chambers in the Temple , made a very good appearance in the first circles , and drove about town in very knowing gigs . But I had no inclination for the law , even in this less abstruse study of it , which my family approved . As for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it -- and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing . I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since . "
36511	36523	36525	36526	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" The consequence of which , I suppose , will be , "
36528	36560	36525	36526	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" since leisure has not promoted your own happiness , that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits , employments , professions , and trades as Columella 's . "
36561	36568	36570	36570	he	1082	" They will be brought up , "
36577	36600	36570	36570	he	1082	" to be as unlike myself as is possible . In feeling , in action , in condition , in every thing . "
36601	36739	36525	36526	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" Come , come ; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits , Edward . You are in a melancholy humour , and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy . But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times , whatever be their education or state . Know your own happiness . You want nothing but patience -- or give it a more fascinating name , call it hope . Your mother will secure to you , in time , that independence you are so anxious for ; it is her duty , and it will , it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent . How much may not a few months do ? "
36740	36744	36746	36746	Edward	96	" I think , "
36748	36762	36746	36746	Edward	96	" that I may defy many months to produce any good to me . "
37444	37447	37449	37449	he	103	" Well , "
37451	37465	37449	37449	he	103	" we have brought you some strangers . How do you like them ? "
37466	37474	37569	37570	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Hush ! they will hear you . "
37475	37508	37449	37449	he	103	" Never mind if they do . It is only the Palmers . Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you . You may see her if you look this way . "
37533	37554	37569	37570	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Where is Marianne ? Has she run away because we are come ? I see her instrument is open . "
37555	37563	37585	37585	she	107	" She is walking , I believe . "
37597	37722	37590	37590	She	107	" How do you do , my dear ? How does Mrs. Dashwood do ? And where are your sisters ? What ! all alone ! you will be glad of a little company to sit with you . I have brought my other son and daughter to see you . Only think of their coming so suddenly ! I thought I heard a carriage last night , while we were drinking our tea , but it never entered my head that it could be them . I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again"--
38017	38102	38004	38004	her	131	" Well ! what a delightful room this is ! I never saw anything so charming ! Only think , Mamma , how it is improved since I was here last ! I always thought it such a sweet place , ma'am ! ( turning to Mrs. Dashwood ) but you have made it so charming ! Only look , sister , how delightful every thing is ! How I should like such a house for myself ! Should not you , Mr. Palmer ? "
38121	38129	38131	38131	she	131	" Mr. Palmer does not hear me , "
38135	38146	38131	38131	she	131	" he never does sometimes . It is so ridiculous ! "
38254	38267	38269	38270	Mrs. Jennings	107	" You may believe how glad we all were to see them , "
38306	38393	38285	38285	she	107	" but , however , I ca n't help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation . I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all ! "
38408	38417	38419	38420	Mrs. Jennings	107	" She expects to be confined in February , "
38449	38456	38457	38457	he	132	" No , none at all , "
38464	38469	38471	38472	Sir John	103	" Here comes Marianne , "
38474	38487	38471	38472	Sir John	103	" Now , Palmer , you shall see a monstrous pretty girl . "
38588	38627	38581	38581	She	131	" Oh ! dear , how beautiful these are ! Well ! how delightful ! Do but look , mama , how sweet ! I declare they are quite charming ; I could look at them for ever . "
38675	38684	38686	38687	his wife	294	" My love , have you been asleep ? "
38899	38906	38908	38908	Marianne	92	" Why should they ask us ? "
38917	38959	38908	38908	Marianne	92	" The rent of this cottage is said to be low ; but we have it on very hard terms , if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them , or with us . "
38960	38974	38976	38976	Elinor	91	" They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now , "
38978	39021	38976	38976	Elinor	91	" by these frequent invitations , than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago . The alteration is not in them , if their parties are grown tedious and dull . We must look for the change elsewhere . "
39081	39090	39092	39092	she	131	" I am so glad to see you ! "
39101	39222	39092	39092	she	131	" for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come , which would be a shocking thing , as we go away again tomorrow . We must go , for the Westons come to us next week you know . It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all , and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door , and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton . He is so droll ! He never tells me any thing ! I am so sorry we can not stay longer ; however we shall meet again in town very soon , I hope . "
39235	39241	39243	39244	Mrs. Palmer	131	" Not go to town ! "
39250	39318	39243	39244	Mrs. Palmer	131	" I shall be quite disappointed if you do not . I could get the nicest house in world for you , next door to ours , in Hanover - square . You must come , indeed . I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined , if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public . "
39332	39338	39340	39341	Mrs. Palmer	131	" Oh , my love , "
39351	39367	39368	39368	Her	131	room--"you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter . "
39388	39395	39397	39397	he	333	" How horrid all this is ! "
39399	39466	39397	39397	he	333	" Such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting . Dullness is as much produced within doors as without , by rain . It makes one detest all one 's acquaintance . What the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house ? How few people know what comfort is ! Sir John is as stupid as the weather . "
39476	39484	39486	39487	Sir John	103	" I am afraid , Miss Marianne , "
39489	39504	39486	39487	Sir John	103	" you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today . "
39513	39524	39526	39527	Mrs. Palmer	131	" Oh , do n't be so sly before us , "
39529	39582	39526	39527	Mrs. Palmer	131	" for we know all about it , I assure you ; and I admire your taste very much , for I think he is extremely handsome . We do not live a great way from him in the country , you know . Not above ten miles , I dare say . "
39583	39588	39590	39591	her husband	333	" Much nearer thirty , "
39593	39621	39526	39527	Mrs. Palmer	131	" Ah , well ! there is not much difference . I never was at his house ; but they say it is a sweet pretty place . "
39622	39635	39637	39638	Mr. Palmer	132	" As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life , "
39656	39662	39664	39665	Mrs. Palmer--"then	3233	" Is it very ugly ? "
39665	39679	39664	39665	Mrs. Palmer--"then	3233	Palmer--"then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose . "
39702	39706	39708	39708	he	103	" My dear , "
39713	39738	39708	39708	he	103	" it is very provoking that we should be so few . Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today ? "
39739	39771	39819	39820	his wife	294	" Did not I tell you , Sir John , when you spoke to me about it before , that it could not be done ? They dined with us last . "
39772	39780	39782	39783	Mrs. Jennings	107	" You and I , Sir John , "
39785	39793	39782	39783	Mrs. Jennings	107	" should not stand upon such ceremony . "
39794	39804	39806	39807	Mr. Palmer	132	" Then you would be very ill - bred , "
39809	39817	39822	39822	her	294	" My love you contradict every body , "
39826	39836	39822	39822	her	294	" Do you know that you are quite rude ? "
39837	39854	39782	39783	Mrs. Jennings	107	" I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill - bred . "
39855	39866	39868	39873	the good - natured old lady	1156	" Ay , you may abuse me as you please , "
39875	39902	39868	39873	the good - natured old lady	1156	" you have taken Charlotte off my hands , and can not give her back again . So there I have the whip hand of you . "
39992	39999	40001	40001	she	130	" Mr. Palmer is so droll ! "
40010	40018	40001	40001	she	130	" He is always out of humour . "
40190	40198	40200	40201	Mrs. Palmer	131	" Oh , my dear Miss Dashwood , "
40205	40261	40200	40201	Mrs. Palmer	131	" I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister . Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas ? Now , pray do,--and come while the Westons are with us . You can not think how happy I shall be ! It will be quite delightful!--My love , "
40267	40281	40200	40201	Mrs. Palmer	131	" do n't you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland ? "
40282	40285	40286	40286	he	333	" Certainly , "
40291	40300	40286	40286	he	333	sneer--"I came into Devonshire with no other view . "
40301	40303	40304	40305	his lady	612	" There now,"--said
40307	40323	40286	40286	he	333	" you see Mr. Palmer expects you ; so you can not refuse to come . "
40333	40442	40304	40305	his lady	612	" But indeed you must and shall come . I am sure you will like it of all things . The Westons will be with us , and it will be quite delightful . You can not think what a sweet place Cleveland is ; and we are so gay now , for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election ; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before , it is quite charming ! But , poor fellow ! it is very fatiguing to him ! for he is forced to make every body like him . "
40460	40467	40469	40469	Charlotte	130	" How charming it will be , "
40471	40527	40469	40469	Charlotte	130	" when he is in Parliament!--won't it ? How I shall laugh ! It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.--But do you know , he says , he will never frank for me ? He declares he wo n't . Do n't you , Mr. Palmer ? "
40536	40546	40547	40547	she	130	" He can not bear writing , you know , "
40549	40557	40547	40547	she	130	" he says it is quite shocking . "
40558	40561	40563	40563	he	132	" No , "
40565	40585	40563	40563	he	132	" I never said any thing so irrational . Do n't palm all your abuses of languages upon me . "
40586	40636	40637	40637	She	130	" There now ; you see how droll he is . This is always the way with him ! Sometimes he wo n't speak to me for half a day together , and then he comes out with something so droll -- all about any thing in the world . "
40663	40666	40668	40668	Elinor	91	" Certainly , "
40670	40676	40668	40668	Elinor	91	" he seems very agreeable . "
40677	40740	40655	40655	she	91	" Well -- I am so glad you do . I thought you would , he is so pleasant ; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you , and you ca n't think how disappointed he will be if you do n't come to Cleveland.--I ca n't imagine why you should object to it . "
40855	40867	40869	40870	Mrs. Palmer;--"Not	3246	" Oh dear , yes ; I know him extremely well , "
40870	41042	40832	40832	She	91	Palmer;--"Not that I ever spoke to him , indeed ; but I have seen him for ever in town . Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was at Allenham . Mama saw him here once before;-- but I was with my uncle at Weymouth . However , I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire , if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together . He is very little at Combe , I believe ; but if he were ever so much there , I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him , for he is in the opposition , you know , and besides it is such a way off . I know why you inquire about him , very well ; your sister is to marry him . I am monstrous glad of it , for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know . "
41043	41048	41050	41050	Elinor	91	" Upon my word , "
41052	41075	41050	41050	Elinor	91	" you know much more of the matter than I do , if you have any reason to expect such a match . "
41076	41108	40832	40832	She	91	" Do n't pretend to deny it , because you know it is what every body talks of . I assure you I heard of it in my way through town . "
41109	41115	41050	41050	Elinor	91	" My dear Mrs. Palmer ! "
41116	41146	40832	40832	She	91	" Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in Bond - street , just before we left town , and he told me of it directly . "
41147	41199	41050	41050	Elinor	91	" You surprise me very much . Colonel Brandon tell you of it ! Surely you must be mistaken . To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do . "
41200	41327	40832	40832	She	91	" But I do assure you it was so , for all that , and I will tell you how it happened . When we met him , he turned back and walked with us ; and so we began talking of my brother and sister , and one thing and another , and I said to him , ' So , Colonel , there is a new family come to Barton cottage , I hear , and mama sends me word they are very pretty , and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna . Is it true , pray ? for of course you must know , as you have been in Devonshire so lately . ' "
41328	41336	41050	41050	Elinor	91	" And what did the Colonel say ? "
41337	41385	40832	40832	She	91	" Oh -- he did not say much ; but he looked as if he knew it to be true , so from that moment I set it down as certain . It will be quite delightful , I declare ! When is it to take place ? "
41386	41395	41050	41050	Elinor	91	" Mr. Brandon was very well I hope ? "
41396	41421	40832	40832	She	91	" Oh ! yes , quite well ; and so full of your praises , he did nothing but say fine things of you . "
41422	41443	41050	41050	Elinor	91	" I am flattered by his commendation . He seems an excellent man ; and I think him uncommonly pleasing . "
41444	41502	40832	40832	She	91	" So do I.--He is such a charming man , that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull . Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was , for he hardly ever falls in love with any body . "
41503	41515	41517	41517	Elinor	91	" Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire ? "
41519	41671	40832	40832	She	91	" Oh ! yes , extremely well ; that is , I do not believe many people are acquainted with him , because Combe Magna is so far off ; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you . Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes , and so you may tell your sister . She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her . However , I do n't think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night . "
41698	41710	40832	40832	She	91	" I am so glad we are got acquainted at last , "
41712	41793	40832	40832	She	91	Charlotte.--"And now I hope we shall always be great friends . You ca n't think how much I longed to see you ! It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage ! Nothing can be like it , to be sure ! And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married ! I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna . It is a sweet place , by all accounts . "
41794	41808	40832	40832	She	91	" You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon , have not you ? "
41809	41834	41835	41835	she	1173	" Yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married.-- He was a particular friend of Sir John 's . I believe , "
41842	41899	41835	41835	she	1173	" he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could . Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much . But mama did not think the match good enough for me , otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel , and we should have been married immediately . "
41900	41928	41835	41835	she	1173	" Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John 's proposal to your mother before it was made ? Had he never owned his affection to yourself ? "
41929	41992	41835	41835	she	1173	" Oh , no ; but if mama had not objected to it , I dare say he would have liked it of all things . He had not seen me then above twice , for it was before I left school . However , I am much happier as I am . Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like . "
42570	42575	42551	42554	Benevolent , philanthropic man	1206	" Do come now , "
42577	42739	42551	42554	Benevolent , philanthropic man	1206	he--"pray come -- you must come -- I declare you shall come -- You ca n't think how you will like them . Lucy is monstrous pretty , and so good humoured and agreeable ! The children are all hanging about her already , as if she was an old acquaintance . And they both long to see you of all things , for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world ; and I have told them it is all very true , and a great deal more . You will be delighted with them I am sure . They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children . How can you be so cross as not to come ? Why they are your cousins , you know , after a fashion . YOU are my cousins , and they are my wife 's , so you must be related . "
43182	43190	43192	43192	she	104	" John is in such spirits today ! "
43208	43215	43195	43195	his	1222	window--"He is full of monkey tricks . "
43239	43245	43235	43235	she	104	" How playful William is ! "
43246	43255	43256	43256	she	104	" And here is my sweet little Annamaria , "
43281	43300	43256	43256	she	104	" And she is always so gentle and quiet -- Never was there such a quiet little thing ! "
43603	43608	43610	43611	Miss Steele	138	" Poor little creatures ! "
43620	43630	43610	43611	Miss Steele	138	" It might have been a very sad accident . "
43631	43638	43640	43640	Marianne	92	" Yet I hardly know how , "
43642	43673	43640	43640	Marianne	92	" unless it had been under totally different circumstances . But this is the usual way of heightening alarm , where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality . "
43674	43683	43685	43686	Lucy Steele	138	" What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is ! "
43757	43763	43765	43767	the elder sister	1241	" And Sir John too , "
43769	43777	43765	43767	the elder sister	1241	" what a charming man he is ! "
43810	43847	43765	43767	the elder sister	1241	" And what a charming little family they have ! I never saw such fine children in my life.--I declare I quite doat upon them already , and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children . "
43848	43854	43856	43856	Elinor	91	" I should guess so , "
43862	43871	43856	43856	Elinor	91	" from what I have witnessed this morning . "
43872	43878	43880	43880	Lucy	138	" I have a notion , "
43882	43939	43880	43880	Lucy	138	" you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton ; and for my part , I love to see children full of life and spirits ; I can not bear them if they are tame and quiet . "
43940	43944	43946	43946	Elinor	91	" I confess , "
43948	43969	43946	43946	Elinor	91	" that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence . "
44000	44021	43982	43983	Miss Steele	138	" And how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex . "
44050	44062	44064	44065	Miss Steele	138	" Norland is a prodigious beautiful place , is not it ? "
44067	44077	44079	44079	Lucy	138	" We have heard Sir John admire it excessively , "
44095	44104	44106	44106	Elinor	91	" I think every one MUST admire it , "
44108	44133	44106	44106	Elinor	91	" who ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do . "
44134	44172	44079	44079	Lucy	138	" And had you a great many smart beaux there ? I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world ; for my part , I think they are a vast addition always . "
44173	44180	44182	44182	Lucy	138	" But why should you think , "
44190	44205	44182	44182	Lucy	138	" that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex ? "
44206	44403	44079	44079	Lucy	138	" Nay , my dear , I 'm sure I do n't pretend to say that there an't . I 'm sure there 's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter ; but you know , how could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland ; and I was only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton , if they had not so many as they used to have . But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux , and had as lief be without them as with them . For my part , I think they are vastly agreeable , provided they dress smart and behave civil . But I ca n't bear to see them dirty and nasty . Now there 's Mr. Rose at Exeter , a prodigious smart young man , quite a beau , clerk to Mr. Simpson , you know , and yet if you do but meet him of a morning , he is not fit to be seen.-- I suppose your brother was quite a beau , Miss Dashwood , before he married , as he was so rich ? "
44404	44409	44411	44411	Elinor	91	" Upon my word , "
44413	44463	44411	44411	Elinor	91	" I can not tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word . But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him . "
44464	44486	44079	44079	Lucy	138	" Oh ! dear ! one never thinks of married men 's being beaux -- they have something else to do . "
44487	44492	44524	44524	she	351	" Lord ! Anne , "
44497	44516	44524	44524	she	351	" you can talk of nothing but beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else . "
44866	44883	44885	44885	she	91	" ' Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure , "
44887	44923	44885	44885	she	91	" and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already . "
45140	45146	45148	45148	he	103	" His name is Ferrars , "
45156	45171	45148	45148	he	103	" but pray do not tell it , for it 's a great secret . "
45172	45175	45177	45178	Miss Steele	138	" Ferrars ! "
45180	45220	45177	45178	Miss Steele	138	" Mr. Ferrars is the happy man , is he ? What ! your sister - in - law 's brother , Miss Dashwood ? a very agreeable young man to be sure ; I know him very well . "
45221	45230	45232	45232	Lucy	138	" How can you say so , Anne ? "
45246	45273	45232	45232	Lucy	138	" Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle 's , it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well . "
45283	45300	45274	45274	Elinor	91	" And who was this uncle ? Where did he live ? How came they acquainted ? "
45752	45766	45768	45768	Lucy	138	" You will think my question an odd one , I dare say , "
45784	45804	45805	45805	Elinor	91	cottage--"but pray , are you personally acquainted with your sister - in - law 's mother , Mrs. Ferrars ? "
45832	45835	45837	45837	Lucy	138	" Indeed ! "
45839	45874	45837	45837	Lucy	138	" I wonder at that , for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes . Then , perhaps , you can not tell me what sort of a woman she is ? "
45875	45878	45880	45880	Elinor	91	" No , "
45903	45910	45837	45837	Lucy	138	" I know nothing of her . "
45911	45930	45932	45932	Lucy	138	" I am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way , "
45941	45976	45932	45932	Lucy	138	" but perhaps there may be reasons -- I wish I might venture ; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent . "
46013	46117	45999	45999	Lucy	138	" I can not bear to have you think me impertinently curious . I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours . And I am sure I should not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU ; indeed , I should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation as I am ; but , however , there is no occasion to trouble YOU . I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars . "
46118	46126	46128	46128	Elinor	91	" I am sorry I do NOT , "
46134	46186	46128	46128	Elinor	91	" if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her . But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family , and therefore I am a little surprised , I confess , at so serious an inquiry into her character . "
46187	46257	46258	46258	She	1277	" I dare say you are , and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it . But if I dared tell you all , you would not be so much surprised . Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present -- but the time MAY come -- how soon it will come must depend upon herself -- when we may be very intimately connected . "
46284	46288	46290	46290	Elinor	91	" Good heavens ! "
46292	46310	46290	46290	Elinor	91	" what do you mean ? Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars ? Can you be ? "
46330	46333	46335	46335	Lucy	138	" No , "
46337	46354	46335	46335	Lucy	138	" not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars -- I never saw him in my life ; but , "
46361	46367	46335	46335	Lucy	138	" to his eldest brother . "
46445	46452	46454	46454	Lucy	138	" You may well be surprised , "
46456	46631	46454	46454	Lucy	138	" for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before ; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family ; because it was always meant to be a great secret , and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour . Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne , and I never should have mentioned it to you , if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy ; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars must seem so odd , that it ought to be explained . And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased , when he knows I have trusted you , because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family , and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters . "--She
46685	46697	46669	46669	she	91	" May I ask if your engagement is of long standing ? "
46698	46707	46669	46669	she	91	" We have been engaged these four years . "
46708	46712	46669	46669	she	91	" Four years ! "
46713	46716	46669	46669	she	91	" Yes . "
46730	46736	46738	46738	she	91	" I did not know , "
46740	46751	46738	46738	she	91	" that you were even acquainted till the other day . "
46752	46779	46669	46669	she	91	" Our acquaintance , however , is of many years date . He was under my uncle 's care , you know , a considerable while . "
46780	46784	46738	46738	she	91	" Your uncle ! "
46785	46801	46669	46669	she	91	" Yes ; Mr. Pratt . Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt ? "
46802	46808	46810	46810	Elinor	91	" I think I have , "
46826	46975	46669	46669	she	91	" He was four years with my uncle , who lives at Longstaple , near Plymouth . It was there our acquaintance begun , for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle , and it was there our engagement was formed , though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil ; but he was almost always with us afterwards . I was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but I was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so well as me , Miss Dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him . "
46976	46979	46986	46986	she	91	" Certainly , "
47013	47058	46996	46996	she	91	falsehood--"Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me , that really -- I beg your pardon ; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name . We can not mean the same Mr. Ferrars . "
47059	47066	47068	47068	Lucy	138	" We can mean no other , "
47072	47133	47068	47068	Lucy	138	" Mr. Edward Ferrars , the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars , of Park Street , and brother of your sister - in - law , Mrs. John Dashwood , is the person I mean ; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends . "
47134	47139	47141	47141	Elinor	91	" It is strange , "
47149	47162	47141	47141	Elinor	91	" that I should never have heard him even mention your name . "
47163	47238	47309	47309	she	1281	" No ; considering our situation , it was not strange . Our first care has been to keep the matter secret.-- You knew nothing of me , or my family , and , therefore , there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name to you ; and , as he was always particularly afraid of his sister 's suspecting any thing , THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it . "
47257	47265	47267	47267	she	1281	" Four years you have been engaged , "
47273	47299	47309	47309	she	1281	" Yes ; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait . Poor Edward ! It puts him quite out of heart . "
47312	47366	47309	47309	she	1281	" To prevent the possibility of mistake , be so good as to look at this face . It does not do him justice , to be sure , but yet I think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for.--I have had it above these three years . "
47430	47437	47439	47439	Lucy	138	" I have never been able , "
47441	47482	47439	47439	Lucy	138	" to give him my picture in return , which I am very much vexed at , for he has been always so anxious to get it ! But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity . "
47483	47491	47493	47493	Elinor	91	" You are quite in the right , "
47509	47514	47516	47516	she	138	" I am sure , "
47518	47581	47516	47516	she	138	" I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say . I shall have no fortune , and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman . "
47582	47591	47593	47593	Elinor	91	" I certainly did not seek your confidence , "
47595	47653	47593	47593	Elinor	91	" but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on . Your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication . You must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety . "
47695	47711	47713	47713	she	91	" I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you , "
47715	47978	47713	47713	she	91	" in telling you all this . I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance . Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward 's mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask . Anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for I am in constant fear of her betraying me . She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day , when Edward 's name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all . You ca n't think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether . I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward 's sake these last four years . Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom -- we can hardly meet above twice a - year . I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke . "
47994	47997	47999	47999	Lucy	138	" Sometimes . "
48006	48025	47999	47999	Lucy	138	" I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely . "
48038	48123	48031	48031	she	1283	" But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it.-- I can not bear the thoughts of making him so miserable , as I know the very mention of such a thing would do . And on my own account too -- so dear as he is to me -- I do n't think I could be equal to it . What would you advise me to do in such a case , Miss Dashwood ? What would you do yourself ? "
48124	48128	48130	48130	Elinor	91	" Pardon me , "
48137	48156	48130	48130	Elinor	91	" but I can give you no advice under such circumstances . Your own judgment must direct you . "
48157	48162	48164	48164	Lucy	138	" To be sure , "
48175	48238	48164	48164	Lucy	138	" his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor Edward is so cast down by it ! Did you not think him dreadful low - spirited when he was at Barton ? He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple , to go to you , that I was afraid you would think him quite ill . "
48239	48255	48130	48130	Elinor	91	" Did he come from your uncle 's , then , when he visited us ? "
48256	48279	48164	48164	Lucy	138	" Oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us . Did you think he came directly from town ? "
48280	48283	48285	48285	Elinor	91	" No , "
48301	48321	48285	48285	Elinor	91	" I remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth . "
48353	48364	48366	48366	Lucy	138	" Did not you think him sadly out of spirits ? "
48368	48381	48285	48285	Elinor	91	" We did , indeed , particularly so when he first arrived . "
48382	48454	48459	48459	her	138	" I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter ; but it made him so melancholy , not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us , and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now ; for he writes in wretched spirits . I heard from him just before I left Exeter ; "
48469	48515	48459	48459	her	138	" You know his hand , I dare say , a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible . "
48631	48637	48639	48639	Lucy	138	" Writing to each other , "
48648	48741	48639	48639	Lucy	138	" is the only comfort we have in such long separations . Yes , I have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even THAT . If he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture . Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him ? "
48742	48746	48748	48748	Elinor	91	" I did , "
50806	50811	50813	50814	Lady Middleton	104	" I am glad , "
50818	50876	50813	50814	Lady Middleton	104	" you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria 's basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight . And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to - morrow , and then I hope she will not much mind it . "
50889	50959	50884	50884	herself	138	" Indeed you are very much mistaken , Lady Middleton ; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me , or I should have been at my filigree already . I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card - table now , I am resolved to finish the basket after supper . "
50960	51024	51063	51064	Lady Middleton	104	" You are very good , I hope it wo n't hurt your eyes-- will you ring the bell for some working candles ? My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed , I know , if the basket was not finished tomorrow , for though I told her it certainly would not , I am sure she depends upon having it done . "
51096	51132	51138	51138	she	92	" Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME -- you know I detest cards . I shall go to the piano - forte ; I have not touched it since it was tuned . "
51165	51179	51181	51181	Elinor	91	" Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma'am , "
51190	51214	51181	51181	Elinor	91	" and I do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano - forte I ever heard . "
51225	51228	51230	51230	Elinor	91	" Perhaps , "
51232	51307	51230	51230	Elinor	91	" if I should happen to cut out , I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele , in rolling her papers for her ; and there is so much still to be done to the basket , that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly , to finish it this evening . I should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it . "
51308	51322	51324	51324	Lucy	138	" Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help , "
51326	51358	51324	51324	Lucy	138	" for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was ; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all . "
51359	51369	51371	51372	Miss Steele--	149	" Oh ! that would be terrible , indeed , "
51373	51384	51371	51372	Miss Steele--	149	" Dear little soul , how I do love her ! "
51385	51391	51393	51394	Lady Middleton	104	" You are very kind , "
51398	51430	51393	51394	Lady Middleton	104	" and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ? "
51594	51636	51590	51590	Elinor	91	" I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with , if I felt no desire for its continuance , or no farther curiosity on its subject . I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again . "
51637	51641	51643	51643	Lucy	138	" Thank you , "
51646	51681	51643	51643	Lucy	138	" for breaking the ice ; you have set my heart at ease by it ; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday . "
51682	51695	51697	51697	Elinor	91	" Offended me ! How could you suppose so ? Believe me , "
51705	51739	51697	51697	Elinor	91	" nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea . Could you have a motive for the trust , that was not honourable and flattering to me ? "
51740	51748	51750	51750	Lucy	138	" And yet I do assure you , "
51760	51879	51750	51750	Lucy	138	" there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable . I felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs . But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me . If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life , your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure . "
51880	51964	51643	51643	Lucy	138	" Indeed , I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you , to acknowledge your situation to me , and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it . Your case is a very unfortunate one ; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties , and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them . Mr. Ferrars , I believe , is entirely dependent on his mother . "
51965	52096	51750	51750	Lucy	138	" He has only two thousand pounds of his own ; it would be madness to marry upon that , though for my own part , I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh . I have been always used to a very small income , and could struggle with any poverty for him ; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him , perhaps , of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her . We must wait , it may be for many years . With almost every other man in the world , it would be an alarming prospect ; but Edward 's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know . "
52097	52158	51643	51643	Lucy	138	" That conviction must be every thing to you ; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your 's . If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed , as between many people , and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years ' engagement , your situation would have been pitiable , indeed . "
52184	52191	52193	52193	Lucy	138	" Edward 's love for me , "
52195	52258	52193	52193	Lucy	138	" has been pretty well put to the test , by our long , very long absence since we were first engaged , and it has stood the trial so well , that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now . I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment 's alarm on that account from the first . "
52275	52416	52271	52271	Lucy	138	" I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature , and from our different situations in life , from his being so much more in the world than me , and our continual separation , I was enough inclined for suspicion , to have found out the truth in an instant , if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met , or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for , or if he had talked more of one lady than another , or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be . I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick - sighted in general , but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived . "
52417	52421	52423	52423	Elinor	91	" All this , "
52425	52439	52271	52271	Lucy	138	" is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us . "
52440	52444	52446	52446	she	91	" But what , "
52452	52520	52446	52446	she	91	" are your views ? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars 's death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ? "
52521	52586	52271	52271	Lucy	138	" If we could be certain that it would be only for a while ! But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to Robert , and the idea of that , for Edward 's sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures . "
52587	52604	52446	52446	she	91	" And for your own sake too , or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason . "
52615	52623	52625	52625	Elinor	91	" Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars ? "
52627	52653	52446	52446	she	91	" Not at all -- I never saw him ; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother -- silly and a great coxcomb . "
52654	52659	52661	52662	Miss Steele	138	" A great coxcomb ! "
52678	52693	52446	52446	she	91	" Oh , they are talking of their favourite beaux , I dare say . "
52694	52698	52700	52700	Lucy	138	" No sister , "
52702	52716	52700	52700	Lucy	138	" you are mistaken there , our favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs . "
52717	52730	52732	52733	Mrs. Jennings	107	" I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood 's is not , "
52738	52777	52732	52733	Mrs. Jennings	107	" for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who SHE likes . "
52778	52781	52783	52784	Miss Steele	138	" Oh , "
52792	52811	52783	52784	Miss Steele	138	" I dare say Lucy 's beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood 's . "
52868	53033	52855	52855	Marianne	92	" I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned . I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while . That would be enough for us to marry upon , and we might trust to time and chance for the rest . "
53034	53041	53043	53043	Elinor	91	" I should always be happy , "
53045	53093	53043	53043	Elinor	91	" to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ? He is brother to Mrs. John Dashwood -- THAT must be recommendation enough to her husband . "
53094	53110	52855	52855	Marianne	92	" But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward 's going into orders . "
53111	53124	53043	53043	Elinor	91	" Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little . "
53142	53207	53135	53135	Lucy	138	" I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement . We seem so beset with difficulties on every side , that though it would make us miserable for a time , we should be happier perhaps in the end . But you will not give me your advice , Miss Dashwood ? "
53208	53211	53213	53213	Elinor	91	" No , "
53225	53259	53213	53213	Elinor	91	" on such a subject I certainly will not . You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes . "
53260	53266	53268	53268	Lucy	138	" Indeed you wrong me , "
53274	53345	53268	53268	Lucy	138	" I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ' I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , ' I should resolve upon doing it immediately . "
53360	53404	53346	53346	Elinor	91	" This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one . It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person . "
53405	53415	53417	53417	Lucy	138	" ' Tis because you are an indifferent person , "
53432	53468	53417	53417	Lucy	138	" that your judgment might justly have such weight with me . If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having . "
53530	53542	53544	53544	she	138	" Shall you be in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? "
53551	53555	53521	53521	Lucy	138	" Certainly not . "
53556	53563	53565	53566	the other	794	" I am sorry for that , "
53576	53616	53569	53569	her	794	" it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there ! But I dare say you will go for all that . To be sure , your brother and sister will ask you to come to them . "
53617	53633	53521	53521	Lucy	138	" It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do . "
53634	53709	53569	53569	her	794	" How unlucky that is ! I had quite depended upon meeting you there . Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years ! But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward . He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it . "
54253	54470	54249	54249	her	107	" Oh , Lord ! I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I 've quite set my heart upon it . Do n't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I sha n't put myself at all out of my way for you . It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford THAT . We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters . I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I do n't get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault . I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . "
54471	54477	54479	54480	Sir John	103	" I have a notion , "
54482	54555	54479	54480	Sir John	103	" that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it . It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because Miss Dashwood does not wish it . So I would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of Barton , without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it . "
54556	54559	54561	54562	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Nay , "
54564	54712	54561	54562	Mrs. Jennings	107	" I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne 's company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back . But one or the other , if not both of them , I must have . Lord bless me ! how do you think I can live poking by myself , I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me . Come , Miss Marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better . "
54713	54724	54726	54726	Marianne	92	" I thank you , ma'am , sincerely thank you , "
54731	54823	54726	54726	Marianne	92	" your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it . But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother,--I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence -- Oh ! no , nothing should tempt me to leave her . It should not , must not be a struggle . "
55164	55172	55173	55173	she	90	" I am delighted with the plan , "
55176	55360	55173	55173	she	90	" it is exactly what I could wish . Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves . When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music ! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again ! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one . It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London . You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt . And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . "
55361	55371	55373	55373	Elinor	91	" Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , "
55375	55409	55373	55373	Elinor	91	" you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . "
55415	55419	55421	55422	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" And what , "
55424	55456	55421	55422	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward ? Do let me hear a word about the expense of it . "
55457	55494	55503	55504	her mother	347	" My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings 's heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence . "
55495	55501	55503	55504	her mother	347	" That is very true , "
55506	55540	55503	55504	her mother	347	" but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton . "
55541	55554	55556	55556	Marianne	92	" If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings , "
55558	55595	55556	55556	Marianne	92	" at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation . I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . "
55734	55742	55744	55745	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" I will have you BOTH go , "
55747	55811	55744	55745	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" these objections are nonsensical . You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law 's family . "
55876	55922	55873	55873	she	91	" I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . "
56986	56994	56996	56996	Elinor	91	" I am writing home , Marianne , "
56998	57012	56996	56996	Elinor	91	" had not you better defer your letter for a day or two ? "
57013	57024	57026	57026	Marianne	92	" I am NOT going to write to my mother , "
57412	57425	57406	57406	she	92	" Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is ! "
57550	57556	57558	57558	he	110	" Is your sister ill ? "
57740	57743	57744	57744	he	110	" Yes , "
57751	57782	57744	57744	he	110	" almost ever since ; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to Barton . "
57848	57853	57855	57855	she	107	" Oh ! Colonel , "
57863	57978	57855	57855	she	107	" I am monstrous glad to see you -- sorry I could not come before -- beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with-- Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner ! But pray , Colonel , how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today ? "
57979	57998	57855	57855	she	107	" I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer 's , where I have been dining . "
57999	58034	57855	57855	she	107	" Oh , you did ; well , and how do they all do at their house ? How does Charlotte do ? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time . "
58035	58060	57855	57855	she	107	" Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well , and I am commissioned to tell you , that you will certainly see her to - morrow . "
58061	58240	57855	57855	she	107	" Ay , to be sure , I thought as much . Well , Colonel , I have brought two young ladies with me , you see -- that is , you see but one of them now , but there is another somewhere . Your friend , Miss Marianne , too -- which you will not be sorry to hear . I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby will do between you about her . Ay , it is a fine thing to be young and handsome . Well ! I was young once , but I never was very handsome -- worse luck for me . However , I got a very good husband , and I do n't know what the greatest beauty can do more . Ah ! poor man ! he has been dead these eight years and better . But Colonel , where have you been to since we parted ? And how does your business go on ? Come , come , let 's have no secrets among friends . "
58463	58474	58476	58476	she	131	" Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you , "
58478	58508	58476	58476	she	131	" What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mamma ? I forget what it was now , but it was something so droll ! "
58813	58827	58829	58829	she	91	" Has no letter been left here for me since we went out ? "
58847	58855	58856	58856	she	91	" Are you quite sure of it ? "
58859	58876	58856	58856	she	91	" Are you certain that no servant , no porter has left any letter or note ? "
58884	58889	58891	58891	she	91	" How very odd ! "
58908	58914	58918	58918	herself	91	" How odd , indeed ! "
58926	59026	58918	58918	herself	91	" If she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him , as she did ; she would have written to Combe Magna ; and if he is in town , how odd that he should neither come nor write ! Oh ! my dear mother , you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young , a man so little known , to be carried on in so doubtful , so mysterious a manner ! I long to inquire ; and how will MY interference be borne . "
59241	59250	59252	59253	Mrs. Jennings	107	" If this open weather holds much longer , "
59264	59310	59252	59253	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week ; ' tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day 's pleasure . Poor souls ! I always pity them when they do ; they seem to take it so much to heart . "
59311	59316	59318	59318	Marianne	92	" That is true , "
59339	59357	59318	59318	Marianne	92	" I had not thought of that . This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country . "
59373	59382	59383	59383	she	92	" It is charming weather for THEM indeed , "
59399	59408	59383	59383	she	92	" How much they must enjoy it ! But "
59417	59488	59383	59383	she	92	" it can not be expected to last long . At this time of the year , and after such a series of rain , we shall certainly have very little more of it . Frosts will soon set in , and in all probability with severity . In another day or two perhaps ; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer -- nay , perhaps it may freeze tonight ! "
59489	59494	59496	59496	Elinor	91	" At any rate , "
59515	59536	59501	59502	Mrs. Jennings	107	" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week . "
59537	59557	59496	59496	Elinor	91	" Ay , my dear , I 'll warrant you we do . Mary always has her own way . "
59558	59562	59565	59565	Elinor	91	" And now , "
59567	59579	59565	59565	Elinor	91	" she will write to Combe by this day 's post . "
59719	59788	59691	59691	Marianne	92	" Do n't you find it colder than it was in the morning , Elinor ? There seems to me a very decided difference . I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff . It was not so yesterday , I think . The clouds seem parting too , the sun will be out in a moment , and we shall have a clear afternoon . "
60100	60104	60106	60106	Marianne	92	" Good God ! "
60108	60118	60106	60106	Marianne	92	" he has been here while we were out . "
60136	60147	60154	60154	her	91	" Depend upon it , he will call again tomorrow . "
60298	60302	60304	60304	Marianne	92	" For me ! "
60310	60319	60304	60304	Marianne	92	" No , ma'am , for my mistress . "
60331	60342	60321	60321	Marianne	92	" It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings ; how provoking ! "
60343	60352	60354	60354	Elinor	91	" You are expecting a letter , then ? "
60362	60371	60321	60321	Marianne	92	" Yes , a little -- not much . "
60377	60387	60321	60321	Marianne	92	" You have no confidence in me , Marianne . "
60388	60406	60321	60321	Marianne	92	" Nay , Elinor , this reproach from YOU -- you who have confidence in no one ! "
60407	60410	60412	60412	Elinor	91	" Me ! "
60417	60428	60412	60412	Elinor	91	" indeed , Marianne , I have nothing to tell . "
60429	60433	60435	60435	Marianne	92	" Nor I , "
60439	60472	60435	60435	Marianne	92	" our situations then are alike . We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing . "
60974	60983	60985	60985	he	132	" I thought you were both in Devonshire , "
60987	60991	60993	60993	Elinor	91	" Did you ? "
60995	61003	60961	60961	himself	108	" When do you go back again ? "
61004	61010	61019	61019	Marianne	92	" I do not know . "
61055	61060	61062	61063	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Aye , aye , "
61065	61121	61062	61063	Mrs. Jennings	107	" we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited . "
61122	61125	61127	61127	Marianne	92	" Invited ! "
61129	61151	61152	61152	Marianne	92	" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . "
61485	61494	61538	61538	his	110	" your sister looks unwell to - day , "
61496	61504	61505	61505	he	110	" your sister seems out of spirits , "
61600	61613	61592	61592	He	110	" your sister 's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known . "
61614	61622	61624	61624	Elinor	91	" It can not be generally known , "
61626	61636	61624	61624	Elinor	91	" for her own family do not know it . "
61643	61680	61637	61637	He	110	" I beg your pardon , I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of . "
61681	61696	61592	61592	He	110	" How can that be ? By whom can you have heard it mentioned ? "
61697	61896	61637	61637	He	110	" By many -- by some of whom you know nothing , by others with whom you are most intimate , Mrs. Jennings , Mrs. Palmer , and the Middletons . But still I might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister 's writing . I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question . Is every thing finally settled ? Is it impossible to- ? But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding . Excuse me , Miss Dashwood . I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence . Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains . "
62132	62150	62120	62120	his	110	" to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her,"--took
62675	62679	62680	62680	she	1523	" Good heavens ! "
62683	62710	62680	62680	she	1523	" he is there -- he is there -- Oh ! why does he not look at me ? why can not I speak to him ? "
62711	62718	62720	62720	Elinor	91	" Pray , pray be composed , "
62722	62743	62720	62720	Elinor	91	" and do not betray what you feel to every body present . Perhaps he has not observed you yet . "
62918	62946	62907	62907	she	1523	" Good God ! Willoughby , what is the meaning of this ? Have you not received my letters ? Will you not shake hands with me ? "
63006	63048	63001	63001	he	1526	" I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday , and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home . My card was not lost , I hope . "
63049	63058	63060	63060	Marianne	92	" But have you not received my notes ? "
63066	63104	63060	63060	Marianne	92	" Here is some mistake I am sure -- some dreadful mistake . What can be the meaning of it ? Tell me , Willoughby ; for heaven 's sake tell me , what is the matter ? "
63156	63183	63147	63147	he	1526	" Yes , I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town , which you were so good as to send me , "
63241	63248	63249	63249	she	92	" Go to him , Elinor , "
63259	63311	63249	63249	she	92	" and force him to come to me . Tell him I must see him again -- must speak to him instantly.-- I can not rest -- I shall not have a moment 's peace till this is explained -- some dreadful misapprehension or other.-- Oh go to him this moment . "
63312	63342	63347	63347	she	92	" How can that be done ? No , my dearest Marianne , you must wait . This is not the place for explanations . Wait only till tomorrow . "
64015	64022	64059	64059	she	91	" Marianne , may I ask- ? "
64023	64028	64029	64029	she	91	" No , Elinor , "
64032	64042	64029	64029	she	91	" ask nothing ; you will soon know all . "
64517	64607	64514	64514	she	91	" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature . I hope , from the bottom of my heart , he wo n't keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn . Pray , when are they to be married ? "
64641	64720	64622	64622	herself	91	" And have you really , Ma'am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister 's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby ? I thought it had been only a joke , but so serious a question seems to imply more ; and I must beg , therefore , that you will not deceive yourself any longer . I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married . "
64721	64866	64914	64915	Mrs. Jennings	107	" For shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood ! how can you talk so ? Do n't we all know that it must be a match , that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met ? Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ? Come , come , this wo n't do . Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long . I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte . "
64867	64872	64874	64874	Elinor	91	" Indeed , Ma'am , "
64879	64913	64874	64874	Elinor	91	" you are mistaken . Indeed , you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report , and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now . "
65128	65134	65135	65135	MY	0	" Bond Street , January . "
65139	65388	65135	65135	MY	0	" I have just had the honour of receiving your letter , for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments . I am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation ; and though I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you , I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional . I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure , and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions . My esteem for your whole family is very sincere ; but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt , or meant to express , I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem . That I should ever have meant more you will allow to be impossible , when you understand that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere , and it will not be many weeks , I believe , before this engagement is fulfilled . It is with great regret that I obey your commands in returning the letters with which I have been honoured from you , and the lock of hair , which you so obligingly bestowed on me .
65389	65396	65397	65402	Your most obedient " humble servant	3555	" I am , dear Madam , "
65400	65404	65405	65406	JOHN WILLOUGHBY	161	" humble servant , "
65408	65408	65405	65406	JOHN WILLOUGHBY	161	"
66007	66017	65991	65991	she	91	" Poor Elinor ! how unhappy I make you ! "
66018	66023	66025	66026	her sister	351	" I only wish , "
66028	66045	66025	66026	her sister	351	" there were any thing I COULD do , which might be of comfort to you . "
66074	66085	66071	66071	her	92	" Oh ! Elinor , I am miserable , indeed , "
66108	66115	66116	66116	she	91	" Exert yourself , dear Marianne , "
66119	66153	66116	66116	she	91	" if you would not kill yourself and all who love you . Think of your mother ; think of her misery while YOU suffer : for her sake you must exert yourself . "
66154	66163	66165	66165	Marianne	92	" I can not , I can not , "
66167	66230	66165	66165	Marianne	92	" leave me , leave me , if I distress you ; leave me , hate me , forget me ! but do not torture me so . Oh ! how easy for those , who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion ! Happy , happy Elinor , YOU can not have an idea of what I suffer . "
66231	66260	66116	66116	she	91	" Do you call ME happy , Marianne ? Ah ! if you knew!--And can you believe me to be so , while I see you so wretched ! "
66261	66268	66165	66165	Marianne	92	" Forgive me , forgive me , "
66278	66321	66165	66165	Marianne	92	" I know you feel for me ; I know what a heart you have ; but yet you are -- you must be happy ; Edward loves you -- what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ? "
66322	66328	66330	66330	Elinor	91	" Many , many circumstances , "
66334	66341	66343	66343	Marianne	92	" No , no , no , "
66346	66361	66343	66343	Marianne	92	" he loves you , and only you . You CAN have no grief . "
66362	66376	66165	66165	Marianne	92	" I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state . "
66377	66396	66343	66343	Marianne	92	" And you will never see me otherwise . Mine is a misery which nothing can do away . "
66397	66498	66165	66165	Marianne	92	" You must not talk so , Marianne . Have you no comforts ? no friends ? Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation ? Much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period-- if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it . Every additional day of unhappy confidence , on your side , would have made the blow more dreadful . "
66499	66502	66504	66504	Marianne	92	" Engagement ! "
66506	66513	66504	66504	Marianne	92	" there has been no engagement . "
66514	66518	66165	66165	Marianne	92	" No engagement ! "
66519	66540	66504	66504	Marianne	92	" No , he is not so unworthy as you believe him . He has broken no faith with me . "
66541	66551	66165	66165	Marianne	92	" But he told you that he loved you . "
66552	66583	66504	66504	Marianne	92	" Yes -- no -- never absolutely . It was every day implied , but never professedly declared . Sometimes I thought it had been -- but it never was . "
66584	66589	66165	66165	Marianne	92	" Yet you wrote to him?"--
66590	66608	66504	66504	Marianne	92	" Yes -- could that be wrong after all that had passed?-- But I can not talk . "
66666	66757	66761	66761	Her	351	" How surprised you will be , Willoughby , on receiving this ; and I think you will feel something more than surprise , when you know that I am in town . An opportunity of coming hither , though with Mrs. Jennings , was a temptation we could not resist . I wish you may receive this in time to come here to - night , but I will not depend on it . At any rate I shall expect you to - morrow . For the present , adieu .
66758	66760	66761	66761	Her	351	" M.D. "
66784	66959	66761	66761	Her	351	" I can not express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday , nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week ago . I have been expecting to hear from you , and still more to see you , every hour of the day . Pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain . You had better come earlier another time , because we are generally out by one . We were last night at Lady Middleton 's , where there was a dance . I have been told that you were asked to be of the party . But could it be so ? You must be very much altered indeed since we parted , if that could be the case , and you not there . But I will not suppose this possible , and I hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise .
66960	66962	66761	66761	Her	351	" M.D. "
66973	67256	66761	66761	Her	351	" What am I to imagine , Willoughby , by your behaviour last night ? Again I demand an explanation of it . I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced , with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared to me to justify . I was repulsed indeed ! I have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting ; but though I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour , I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it . You have perhaps been misinformed , or purposely deceived , in something concerning me , which may have lowered me in your opinion . Tell me what it is , explain the grounds on which you acted , and I shall be satisfied , in being able to satisfy you . It would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you ; but if I am to do it , if I am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you , that your regard for us all was insincere , that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive , let it be told as soon as possible . My feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision ; I wish to acquit you , but certainty on either side will be ease to what I now suffer . If your sentiments are no longer what they were , you will return my notes , and the lock of my hair which is in your possession .
67257	67259	66761	66761	Her	351	" M.D. "
67372	67377	67378	67378	she	92	" I felt myself , "
67381	67403	67378	67378	she	92	" to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other . "
67404	67410	67412	67412	Elinor	91	" I can believe it , "
67414	67424	67412	67412	Elinor	91	" but unfortunately he did not feel the same . "
67425	67571	67591	67591	she	1581	" He DID feel the same , Elinor -- for weeks and weeks he felt it . I know he did . Whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ) , I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish . This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment ! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton ? The morning that we parted too ! When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again -- his distress -- can I ever forget his distress ? "
67599	67613	67591	67591	she	1581	" Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby . "
67614	67630	67591	67591	she	1581	" Dearest Marianne , who but himself ? By whom can he have been instigated ? "
67631	67738	67591	67591	she	1581	" By all the world , rather than by his own heart . I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion , than believe his nature capable of such cruelty . This woman of whom he writes -- whoever she be -- or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and Edward , may have been so barbarous to bely me . Beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby , whose heart I know so well ? "
67748	67800	67591	67591	she	1581	" Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy , let them be cheated of their malignant triumph , my dear sister , by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits . It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence . "
67801	67806	67808	67808	Marianne	163	" No , no , "
67810	67895	67808	67808	Marianne	163	" misery such as mine has no pride . I care not who knows that I am wretched . The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world . Elinor , Elinor , they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like -- may resist insult , or return mortification -- but I can not . I must feel -- I must be wretched -- and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can . "
67896	67905	67591	67591	she	1581	" But for my mother 's sake and mine-- "
67906	67933	67808	67808	Marianne	163	" I would do more than for my own . But to appear happy when I am so miserable -- Oh ! who can require it ? "
68013	68126	68380	68380	Elinor	91	" It is too much ! Oh , Willoughby , Willoughby , could this be yours ! Cruel , cruel -- nothing can acquit you . Elinor , nothing can . Whatever he might have heard against me-- ought he not to have suspended his belief ? ought he not to have told me of it , to have given me the power of clearing myself ? ' The lock of hair , ( repeating it from the letter , ) which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable . Willoughby , where was your heart when you wrote those words ? Oh , barbarously insolent!--Elinor , can he be justified ? "
68127	68137	68380	68380	Elinor	91	" No , Marianne , in no possible way . "
68138	68200	68380	68380	Elinor	91	" And yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been?--how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh ! no one , no one -- he talked to me only of myself . "
68215	68239	68380	68380	Elinor	91	" Elinor , I must go home . I must go and comfort mama . Can not we be gone to - morrow ? "
68240	68247	68380	68380	Elinor	91	" To - morrow , Marianne ! "
68248	68276	68380	68380	Elinor	91	" Yes , why should I stay here ? I came only for Willoughby 's sake -- and now who cares for me ? Who regards me ? "
68277	68312	68380	68380	Elinor	91	" It would be impossible to go to - morrow . We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility ; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that . "
68313	68379	68380	68380	Elinor	91	" Well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but I can not stay here long , I can not stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people . The Middletons and Palmers -- how am I to bear their pity ? The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton ! Oh , what would HE say to that ! "
68528	68534	68535	68535	she	107	" How do you do my dear?"--said
68555	68827	68535	68535	she	107	" How is she , Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing ! she looks very bad.-- No wonder . Ay , it is but too true . He is to be married very soon -- a good - for - nothing fellow ! I have no patience with him . Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was . Well , said I , all I can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out . And so I shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it . I have no notion of men 's going on in this way ; and if ever I meet him again , I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day . But there is one comfort , my dear Miss Marianne ; he is not the only young man in the world worth having ; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers . Well , poor thing ! I wo n't disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with . The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know , and that will amuse her . "
68879	68903	68904	68904	Elinor	91	" no , she would go down ; she could bear it very well , and the bustle about her would be less . "
69295	69299	69301	69302	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Poor soul ! "
69311	69425	69301	69302	Mrs. Jennings	107	" how it grieves me to see her ! And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine ! And the dried cherries too ! Lord ! nothing seems to do her any good . I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like , I would send all over the town for it . Well , it is the oddest thing to me , that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill ! But when there is plenty of money on one side , and next to none on the other , Lord bless you ! they care no more about such things!-- "
69426	69442	69284	69284	she	92	" The lady then -- Miss Grey I think you called her-- is very rich ? "
69443	69668	69301	69302	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Fifty thousand pounds , my dear . Did you ever see her ? a smart , stylish girl they say , but not handsome . I remember her aunt very well , Biddy Henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man . But the family are all rich together . Fifty thousand pounds ! and by all accounts , it wo n't come before it 's wanted ; for they say he is all to pieces . No wonder ! dashing about with his curricle and hunters ! Well , it do n't signify talking ; but when a young man , be who he will , comes and makes love to a pretty girl , and promises marriage , he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor , and a richer girl is ready to have him . Why do n't he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ? I warrant you , Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round . But that wo n't do now - a - days ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age . "
69669	69689	69284	69284	she	92	" Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is ? Is she said to be amiable ? "
69690	69751	69301	69302	Mrs. Jennings	107	" I never heard any harm of her ; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned ; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning , that one day Miss Walker hinted to her , that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married , for she and Mrs. Ellison could never agree . "--
69752	69759	69284	69284	she	92	" And who are the Ellisons ? "
69760	69788	69301	69302	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Her guardians , my dear . But now she is of age and may choose for herself ; and a pretty choice she has made!--What now , "
69792	69877	69284	69284	she	92	moment--"your poor sister is gone to her own room , I suppose , to moan by herself . Is there nothing one can get to comfort her ? Poor dear , it seems quite cruel to let her be alone . Well , by - and - by we shall have a few friends , and that will amuse her a little . What shall we play at ? She hates whist I know ; but is there no round game she cares for ? "
69878	69924	69284	69284	she	92	" Dear ma'am , this kindness is quite unnecessary . Marianne , I dare say , will not leave her room again this evening . I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed , for I am sure she wants rest . "
69925	70110	69284	69284	she	92	" Aye , I believe that will be best for her . Let her name her own supper , and go to bed . Lord ! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two , for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that . And so the letter that came today finished it ! Poor soul ! I am sure if I had had a notion of it , I would not have joked her about it for all my money . But then you know , how should I guess such a thing ? I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter , and you know young people like to be laughed at about them . Lord ! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it ! If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street in my way home , and told them of it . But I shall see them tomorrow . "
70111	70206	69284	69284	she	92	" It would be unnecessary I am sure , for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister . Their own good - nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings will be spared , as you my dear madam will easily believe . "
70207	70331	69284	69284	she	92	" Oh ! Lord ! yes , that I do indeed . It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world . You saw I did not all dinner time . No more would Sir John , nor my daughters , for they are all very thoughtful and considerate ; especially if I give them a hint , as I certainly will . For my part , I think the less that is said about such things , the better , the sooner ' tis blown over and forgot . And what does talking ever do you know ? "
70332	70401	69284	69284	she	92	" In this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation . I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughby -- he has broken no positive engagement with my sister . "
70402	70441	69284	69284	she	92	" Law , my dear ! Do n't pretend to defend him . No positive engagement indeed ! after taking her all over Allenham House , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter ! "
70512	70901	70504	70504	her	107	" Well , my dear , ' tis a true saying about an ill - wind , for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon . He will have her at last ; aye , that he will . Mind me , now , if they an't married by Mid - summer . Lord ! how he 'll chuckle over this news ! I hope he will come tonight . It will be all to one a better match for your sister . Two thousand a year without debt or drawback -- except the little love - child , indeed ; aye , I had forgot her ; but she may be ' prenticed out at a small cost , and then what does it signify ? Delaford is a nice place , I can tell you ; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place , full of comforts and conveniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit - trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner ! Lord ! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there ! Then , there is a dove - cote , some delightful stew - ponds , and a very pretty canal ; and every thing , in short , that one could wish for ; and , moreover , it is close to the church , and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike - road , so ' tis never dull , for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house , you may see all the carriages that pass along . Oh ! ' tis a nice place ! A butcher hard by in the village , and the parsonage - house within a stone 's throw . To my fancy , a thousand times prettier than Barton Park , where they are forced to send three miles for their meat , and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother . Well , I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can . One shoulder of mutton , you know , drives another down . If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head ! "
70902	70913	70915	70915	Elinor	91	" Ay , if we can do THAT , Ma'am , "
70917	70929	70915	70915	Elinor	91	" we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon . "
70981	70988	70994	70995	her sister	351	" You had better leave me , "
71000	71006	71008	71008	Elinor	91	" I will leave you , "
71010	71018	71008	71008	Elinor	91	" if you will go to bed . "
71117	71121	71123	71123	she	107	" My dear , "
71127	71206	71123	71123	she	107	" I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted , so I have brought a glass of it for your sister . My poor husband ! how fond he was of it ! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout , he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world . Do take it to your sister . "
71207	71211	71213	71213	Elinor	91	" Dear Ma'am , "
71228	71281	71213	71213	Elinor	91	" how good you are ! But I have just left Marianne in bed , and , I hope , almost asleep ; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest , if you will give me leave , I will drink the wine myself . "
71439	71463	71423	71423	she	107	" The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see . He knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear . "
71494	71500	71502	71502	she	107	" Marianne is not well , "
71504	71522	71502	71502	she	107	" She has been indisposed all day , and we have persuaded her to go to bed . "
71523	71528	71529	71529	he	108	" Perhaps , then , "
71533	71557	71529	71529	he	108	" what I heard this morning may be -- there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first . "
71558	71564	71502	71502	she	107	" What did you hear ? "
71565	71614	71529	71529	he	108	" That a gentleman , whom I had reason to think -- in short , that a man , whom I KNEW to be engaged -- but how shall I tell you ? If you know it already , as surely you must , I may be spared . "
71615	71619	71621	71621	Elinor	91	" You mean , "
71627	71676	71621	71621	Elinor	91	" Mr. Willoughby 's marriage with Miss Grey . Yes , we DO know it all . This seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us . Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable ! Where did you hear it ? "
71677	71892	71529	71529	he	108	" In a stationer 's shop in Pall Mall , where I had business . Two ladies were waiting for their carriage , and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match , in a voice so little attempting concealment , that it was impossible for me not to hear all . The name of Willoughby , John Willoughby , frequently repeated , first caught my attention ; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey -- it was no longer to be a secret -- it would take place even within a few weeks , with many particulars of preparations and other matters . One thing , especially , I remember , because it served to identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony was over , they were to go to Combe Magna , his seat in Somersetshire . My astonishment!--but it would be impossible to describe what I felt . The communicative lady I learnt , on inquiry , for I stayed in the shop till they were gone , was a Mrs. Ellison , and that , as I have been since informed , is the name of Miss Grey 's guardian . "
71893	71924	71621	71621	Elinor	91	" It is . But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds ? In that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation . "
71925	71939	71529	71529	he	108	" It may be so ; but Willoughby is capable -- at least I think"--he
71955	71962	71529	71529	he	108	" And your sister-- how did she-- "
71963	72047	71621	71621	Elinor	91	" Her sufferings have been very severe . I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short . It has been , it is a most cruel affliction . Till yesterday , I believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps -- but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her . He has been very deceitful ! and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him . "
72048	72051	72053	72054	Colonel Brandon	108	" Ah ! "
72056	72083	72053	72054	Colonel Brandon	108	" there is , indeed ! But your sister does not -- I think you said so -- she does not consider quite as you do ? "
72084	72104	72105	72105	He	108	" You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . "
72425	72437	72438	72438	she	1614	" No , no , no , it can not be , "
72441	72479	72438	72438	she	1614	" she can not feel . Her kindness is not sympathy ; her good - nature is not tenderness . All that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because I supply it . "
72694	72713	72687	72687	she	107	" Now , my dear , I bring you something that I am sure will do you good . "
73299	73305	73307	73307	Elinor	91	" Who can this be ? "
73309	73321	73307	73307	Elinor	91	" So early too ! I thought we HAD been safe . "
73327	73333	73335	73335	she	92	" It is Colonel Brandon ! "
73340	73348	73335	73335	she	92	" We are never safe from HIM . "
73349	73363	73307	73307	Elinor	91	" He will not come in , as Mrs. Jennings is from home . "
73364	73372	73335	73335	she	92	" I will not trust to THAT , "
73379	73402	73335	73335	she	92	" A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . "
73473	73482	73484	73484	he	108	" I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street , "
73491	73654	73655	73655	He	1637	" and she encouraged me to come on ; and I was the more easily encouraged , because I thought it probable that I might find you alone , which I was very desirous of doing . My object -- my wish -- my sole wish in desiring it -- I hope , I believe it is -- is to be a means of giving comfort;--no , I must not say comfort -- not present comfort -- but conviction , lasting conviction to your sister 's mind . My regard for her , for yourself , for your mother -- will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere regard -- nothing but an earnest desire of being useful -- I think I am justified -- though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right , is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong ? "
73658	73663	73665	73665	Elinor	91	" I understand you , "
73667	73733	73665	73665	Elinor	91	" You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby , that will open his character farther . Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne . MY gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end , and HERS must be gained by it in time . Pray , pray let me hear it . "
73734	73808	73919	73919	He	1638	" You shall ; and , to be brief , when I quitted Barton last October,--but this will give you no idea -- I must go farther back . You will find me a very awkward narrator , Miss Dashwood ; I hardly know where to begin . A short account of myself , I believe , will be necessary , and it SHALL be a short one . On such a subject , "
73812	73822	73919	73919	He	1638	" can I have little temptation to be diffuse . "
73840	73903	73665	73665	Elinor	91	" You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation-- ( it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park -- it was the evening of a dance -- in which I alluded to a lady I had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister Marianne . "
73904	73907	73909	73909	Elinor	91	" Indeed , "
73911	73918	73919	73919	He	1638	" I have NOT forgotten it . "
73929	74543	74544	74544	he	1639	" If I am not deceived by the uncertainty , the partiality of tender recollection , there is a very strong resemblance between them , as well in mind as person . The same warmth of heart , the same eagerness of fancy and spirits . This lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father . Our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends . I can not remember the time when I did not love Eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt . Her 's , for me , was , I believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate . At seventeen she was lost to me for ever . She was married -- married against her inclination to my brother . Her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered . And this , I fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian . My brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her . I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing -- but how blindly I relate ! I have never told you how this was brought on . We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland . The treachery , or the folly , of my cousin 's maid betrayed us . I was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father 's point was gained . I had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one-- but had her marriage been happy , so young as I then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least I should not have now to lament it . This however was not the case . My brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly . The consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon 's , was but too natural . She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned . But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ? Had I remained in England , perhaps -- but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange . The shock which her marriage had given me , "
74554	74593	74544	74544	he	1639	" was of trifling weight -- was nothing to what I felt when I heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce . It was THAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection of what I suffered-- "
74668	75051	75060	75060	Elinor	91	" It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned to England . My first care , when I DID arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy . I could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin . Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person . He imagined , and calmly could he imagine it , that her extravagance , and consequent distress , had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief . At last , however , and after I had been six months in England , I DID find her . Regard for a former servant of my own , who had since fallen into misfortune , carried me to visit him in a spunging - house , where he was confined for debt ; and there , the same house , under a similar confinement , was my unfortunate sister . So altered -- so faded -- worn down by acute suffering of every kind ! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom I had once doted . What I endured in so beholding her -- but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it -- I have pained you too much already . That she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was -- yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort . Life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given . I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life : I was with her in her last moments . "
75079	75091	75093	75093	he	1641	" Your sister , I hope , can not be offended , "
75095	75684	75093	75093	he	1641	" by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation . Their fates , their fortunes , can not be the same ; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind , or a happier marriage , she might have been all that you will live to see the other be . But to what does all this lead ? I seem to have been distressing you for nothing . Ah ! Miss Dashwood -- a subject such as this -- untouched for fourteen years -- it is dangerous to handle it at all ! I WILL be more collected -- more concise . She left to my care her only child , a little girl , the offspring of her first guilty connection , who was then about three years old . She loved the child , and had always kept it with her . It was a valued , a precious trust to me ; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense , by watching over her education myself , had the nature of our situations allowed it ; but I had no family , no home ; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school . I saw her there whenever I could , and after the death of my brother , ( which happened about five years ago , and which left to me the possession of the family property , ) she visited me at Delaford . I called her a distant relation ; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her . It is now three years ago ( she had just reached her fourteenth year , ) that I removed her from school , to place her under the care of a very respectable woman , residing in Dorsetshire , who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life ; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation . But last February , almost a twelvemonth back , she suddenly disappeared . I had allowed her , ( imprudently , as it has since turned out , ) at her earnest desire , to go to Bath with one of her young friends , who was attending her father there for his health . I knew him to be a very good sort of man , and I thought well of his daughter -- better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill - judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all . He , her father , a well - meaning , but not a quick - sighted man , could really , I believe , give no information ; for he had been generally confined to the house , while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose ; and he tried to convince me , as thoroughly as he was convinced himself , of his daughter 's being entirely unconcerned in the business . In short , I could learn nothing but that she was gone ; all the rest , for eight long months , was left to conjecture . What I thought , what I feared , may be imagined ; and what I suffered too . "
75685	75689	75691	75691	Elinor	91	" Good heavens ! "
75693	75699	75691	75691	Elinor	91	" could it be -- could Willoughby!"--
75700	75710	75711	75711	he	1643	" The first news that reached me of her , "
75714	75928	75711	75711	he	1643	" came in a letter from herself , last October . It was forwarded to me from Delaford , and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell ; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly , which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body , and which I believe gave offence to some . Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine , I suppose , when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party , that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable ; but HAD he known it , what would it have availed ? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister ? No , he had already done that , which no man who CAN feel for another would do . He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced , in a situation of the utmost distress , with no creditable home , no help , no friends , ignorant of his address ! He had left her , promising to return ; he neither returned , nor wrote , nor relieved her . "
75929	75936	75938	75938	Elinor	91	" This is beyond every thing ! "
75940	76353	76489	76489	Elinor	91	" His character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both . Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it . To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister -- but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister 's influence might yet reclaim him . But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her . Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self - reproach , which must attend her through life . Surely this comparison must have its use with her . She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing . They proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace . On the contrary , every friend must be made still more her friend by them . Concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment . Use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what I have told you . You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others . "
76385	76392	76394	76394	she	91	" I have been more pained , "
76396	76448	76449	76449	she	91	" by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier . Have you , "
76457	76469	76449	76449	she	91	" ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton ? "
76470	76473	76474	76474	he	1644	" Yes , "
76478	76488	76474	76474	he	1644	" once I have . One meeting was unavoidable . "
76503	76511	76489	76489	Elinor	91	" What ? have you met him to-- "
76512	76581	76489	76489	Elinor	91	" I could meet him no other way . Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct . We returned unwounded , and the meeting , therefore , never got abroad . "
76605	76608	76610	76611	Colonel Brandon	108	" Such , "
76617	76640	76610	76611	Colonel Brandon	108	" has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter ! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust ! "
76641	76648	76693	76693	he	108	" Is she still in town ? "
76649	76686	76693	76693	he	108	" No ; as soon as she recovered from her lying - in , for I found her near her delivery , I removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains . "
77776	77911	77766	77767	Sir John	103	" A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well ! Such a good - natured fellow ! He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England ! It was an unaccountable business . He wished him at the devil with all his heart . He would not speak another word to him , meet him where he might , for all the world ! No , not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert , and they were kept watching for two hours together . Such a scoundrel of a fellow ! such a deceitful dog ! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly 's puppies ! and this was the end of it ! "
77923	78014	77912	77913	Mrs. Palmer	131	" She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all . She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was . "
78237	78245	78214	78214	her	104	" It is very shocking , indeed ! "
78927	78943	78945	78945	she	91	" I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here STILL , "
78956	79065	78945	78945	she	91	" But I always thought I SHOULD . I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you TOLD me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a MONTH . But I thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point . It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came . And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone . I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD . "
79090	79096	79098	79099	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Well , my dear , "
79101	79108	79098	79099	Mrs. Jennings	107	" and how did you travel ? "
79109	79119	79121	79122	Miss Steele	138	" Not in the stage , I assure you , "
79128	79184	79121	79122	Miss Steele	138	" we came post all the way , and had a very smart beau to attend us . Dr. Davies was coming to town , and so we thought we 'd join him in a post - chaise ; and he behaved very genteelly , and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did . "
79185	79190	79192	79193	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Oh , oh ! "
79195	79213	79192	79193	Mrs. Jennings	107	" very pretty , indeed ! and the Doctor is a single man , I warrant you . "
79214	79218	79220	79221	Miss Steele	138	" There now , "
79226	79326	79220	79221	Miss Steele	138	" everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor , and I can not think why . My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest ; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour 's end to another . ' Lord ! here comes your beau , Nancy , ' my cousin said t'other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house . My beau , indeed ! said I -- I can not think who you mean . The Doctor is no beau of mine . "
79327	79352	79360	79361	her cousin	1702	" Aye , aye , that is very pretty talking -- but it wo n't do-- the Doctor is the man , I see . "
79353	79358	79220	79221	Miss Steele	138	" No , indeed ! "
79367	79384	79220	79221	Miss Steele	138	" and I beg you will contradict it , if you ever hear it talked of . "
79407	79430	79432	79432	Lucy	138	" I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister , Miss Dashwood , when they come to town , "
79447	79457	79385	79386	Mrs. Jennings	107	" No , I do not think we shall . "
79458	79469	79510	79511	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Oh , yes , I dare say you will . "
79479	79500	79385	79386	Mrs. Jennings	107	" What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together ! "
79501	79508	79510	79511	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Long a time , indeed ! "
79513	79523	79510	79511	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Why , their visit is but just begun ! "
79528	79542	79544	79545	Miss Steele	138	" I am sorry we can not see your sister , Miss Dashwood , "
79547	79555	79544	79545	Miss Steele	138	" I am sorry she is not well-- "
79566	79609	79557	79557	Marianne	92	" You are very good . My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head - aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation . "
79610	79646	79544	79545	Miss Steele	138	" Oh , dear , that is a great pity ! but such old friends as Lucy and me!--I think she might see US ; and I am sure we would not speak a word . "
79682	79690	79692	79693	Miss Steele	138	" Oh , if that 's all , "
79695	79706	79692	79693	Miss Steele	138	" we can just as well go and see HER . "
80422	80433	80435	80435	he	744	" I wished very much to call upon you yesterday , "
80437	80601	80435	80435	he	744	" but it was impossible , for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars . Harry was vastly pleased . THIS morning I had fully intended to call on you , if I could possibly find a spare half hour , but one has always so much to do on first coming to town . I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal . But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street , and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings . I understand she is a woman of very good fortune . And the Middletons too , you must introduce me to THEM . As my mother - in - law 's relations , I shall be happy to show them every respect . They are excellent neighbours to you in the country , I understand . "
80602	80625	80777	80778	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Excellent indeed . Their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than I can express . "
80626	80749	80435	80435	he	744	" I am extremely glad to hear it , upon my word ; extremely glad indeed . But so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected . And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing ! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing . It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , I assure you . "
80861	80883	80840	80840	He	87	" but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where . "
81046	81059	81165	81165	himself	1739	" Who is Colonel Brandon ? Is he a man of fortune ? "
81060	81071	81000	81000	he	87	" Yes ; he has very good property in Dorsetshire . "
81072	81107	81165	81165	himself	1739	" I am glad of it . He seems a most gentlemanlike man ; and I think , Elinor , I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life . "
81108	81118	81000	81000	he	87	" Me , brother ! what do you mean ? "
81119	81143	81165	81165	himself	1739	" He likes you . I observed him narrowly , and am convinced of it . What is the amount of his fortune ? "
81144	81153	81000	81000	he	87	" I believe about two thousand a year . "
81154	81161	81174	81174	he	1739	" Two thousand a - year ; "
81177	81196	81174	81174	he	1739	" Elinor , I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much , for your sake . "
81197	81203	81205	81205	Elinor	91	" Indeed I believe you , "
81207	81225	81205	81205	Elinor	91	" but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME . "
81226	81410	81411	81411	his	1740	" You are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken . A very little trouble on your side secures him . Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it . But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself . And there can be no reason why you should not try for him . It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side -- in short , you know as to an attachment of that kind , it is quite out of the question , the objections are insurmountable-- you have too much sense not to see all that . Colonel Brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family . It is a match that must give universal satisfaction . In short , it is a kind of thing that"--lowering
81416	81424	81430	81430	he	1740	whisper--"will be exceedingly welcome to ALL PARTIES . "
81433	81504	81430	81430	he	1740	" That is , I mean to say -- your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; Fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , I assure you . And her mother too , Mrs. Ferrars , a very good - natured woman , I am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day . "
81512	81521	81522	81522	he	1740	" It would be something remarkable , now , "
81525	81553	81522	81522	he	1740	" something droll , if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time . And yet it is not very unlikely . "
81554	81560	81562	81562	Elinor	91	" Is Mr. Edward Ferrars , "
81567	81573	81562	81562	Elinor	91	" going to be married ? "
81574	81765	81766	81766	He	1741	" It is not actually settled , but there is such a thing in agitation . He has a most excellent mother . Mrs. Ferrars , with the utmost liberality , will come forward , and settle on him a thousand a year , if the match takes place . The lady is the Hon . Miss Morton , only daughter of the late Lord Morton , with thirty thousand pounds . A very desirable connection on both sides , and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time . A thousand a - year is a great deal for a mother to give away , to make over for ever ; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit . To give you another instance of her liberality:--The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny 's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds . And extremely acceptable it is , for we must live at a great expense while we are here . "
81781	81802	81775	81775	she	1741	" Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable ; but your income is a large one . "
81803	81954	81766	81766	He	1741	" Not so large , I dare say , as many people suppose . I do not mean to complain , however ; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one , and I hope will in time be better . The enclosure of Norland Common , now carrying on , is a most serious drain . And then I have made a little purchase within this half year ; East Kingham Farm , you must remember the place , where old Gibson used to live . The land was so very desirable for me in every respect , so immediately adjoining my own property , that I felt it my duty to buy it . I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands . A man must pay for his convenience ; and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money . "
81955	81966	81775	81775	she	1741	" More than you think it really and intrinsically worth . "
81967	82047	81766	81766	He	1741	" Why , I hope not that . I might have sold it again , the next day , for more than I gave : but , with regard to the purchase - money , I might have been very unfortunate indeed ; for the stocks were at that time so low , that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker 's hands , I must have sold out to very great loss . "
82053	82185	81775	81775	she	1741	" Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland . Our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland ( and very valuable they were ) to your mother . Far be it from me to repine at his doing so ; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose , but , in consequence of it , we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen , china , & c. to supply the place of what was taken away . You may guess , after all these expenses , how very far we must be from being rich , and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars 's kindness is . "
82186	82189	82191	82191	Elinor	91	" Certainly , "
82193	82212	82191	82191	Elinor	91	" and assisted by her liberality , I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances . "
82213	82224	82225	82225	he	1742	" Another year or two may do much towards it , "
82229	82268	82225	82225	he	1742	" but however there is still a great deal to be done . There is not a stone laid of Fanny 's green - house , and nothing but the plan of the flower - garden marked out . "
82269	82279	82191	82191	Elinor	91	" Where is the green - house to be ? "
82280	82349	82225	82225	he	1742	" Upon the knoll behind the house . The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it . It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park , and the flower - garden will slope down just before it , and be exceedingly pretty . We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow . "
82434	82530	82420	82420	he	1742	" She seems a most valuable woman indeed -- Her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten.-- She must have a great deal to leave . "
82531	82555	82420	82420	he	1742	" Nothing at all , I should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children . "
82556	82594	82420	82420	he	1742	" But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income . Few people of common prudence will do THAT ; and whatever she saves , she will be able to dispose of . "
82595	82617	82420	82420	he	1742	" And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ? "
82618	82711	82420	82420	he	1742	" Her daughters are both exceedingly well married , and therefore I can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther . Whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard . Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour ; and she can hardly do all this , without being aware of the expectation it raises . "
82712	82738	82420	82420	he	1742	" But she raises none in those most concerned . Indeed , brother , your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far . "
82739	82746	82748	82748	he	1746	" Why , to be sure , "
82755	82799	82748	82748	he	1746	" people have little , have very little in their power . But , my dear Elinor , what is the matter with Marianne?-- she looks very unwell , has lost her colour , and is grown quite thin . Is she ill ? "
82800	82818	82420	82420	he	1742	" She is not well , she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks . "
82819	83016	82748	82748	he	1746	" I am sorry for that . At her time of life , any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever ! Her 's has been a very short one ! She was as handsome a girl last September , as I ever saw ; and as likely to attract the man . There was something in her style of beauty , to please them particularly . I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her . She will be mistaken , however . I question whether Marianne NOW , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a - year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better . Dorsetshire ! I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . "
83213	83225	83227	83227	he	87	" I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny , "
83237	83377	83227	83227	he	87	" Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman ! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know . And Mrs. Jennings too , an exceedingly well - behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter . Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with . But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both . "
84450	84458	84460	84460	Lucy	138	" Pity me , dear Miss Dashwood ! "
84489	84528	84484	84485	the servant	839	time--"There is nobody here but you , that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand . Good gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on -- that is to be my mother!"--
85535	85544	85546	85546	he	1838	" These are done by my eldest sister , "
85548	85597	85546	85546	he	1838	" and you , as a man of taste , will , I dare say , be pleased with them . I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before , but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well . "
85701	85702	85703	85704	Mrs. Ferrars--"very	189	" Hum"--said
85704	85705	85703	85704	Mrs. Ferrars--"very	189	Ferrars--"very pretty,"--and
85741	85752	85737	85737	she	95	" They are very pretty , ma'am -- an't they ? "
85779	85807	85775	85775	she	95	" Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton 's style of painting , Ma'am?--She DOES paint most delightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done ! "
85808	85819	85775	85775	she	95	" Beautifully indeed ! But SHE does every thing well . "
85869	85901	85848	85848	she	95	" This is admiration of a very particular kind!-- what is Miss Morton to us?--who knows , or who cares , for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak . "
85954	85963	85940	85940	herself	95	" Miss Morton is Lord Morton 's daughter . "
86138	86157	86118	86118	her	101	" Dear , dear Elinor , do n't mind them . Do n't let them make YOU unhappy . "
86216	86222	86210	86210	Jennings	107	" Ah ! poor dear , "
86315	86319	86335	86335	he	103	" Poor Marianne ! "
86340	86414	86335	86335	he	103	" She has not such good health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor 's constitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions . You would not think it perhaps , but Marianne WAS remarkably handsome a few months ago ; quite as handsome as Elinor.-- Now you see it is all gone . "
86729	86734	86736	86736	Lucy	138	" My dear friend , "
86746	86838	86736	86736	Lucy	138	" I come to talk to you of my happiness . Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars 's way of treating me yesterday ? So exceeding affable as she was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;-- but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me . Now was not it so?-- You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ? "
86839	86848	86902	86902	Lucy	138	" She was certainly very civil to you . "
86849	86892	86736	86736	Lucy	138	" Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast deal more . Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride , no hauteur , and your sister just the same -- all sweetness and affability ! "
86923	86933	86935	86935	she	91	" Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement , "
86937	86953	86935	86935	she	91	" nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was not the case"--
86954	86960	86961	86961	Lucy	138	" I guessed you would say so"--replied
86962	87060	86935	86935	she	91	quickly--"but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing . You sha n't talk me out of my satisfaction . I am sure it will all end well , and there will be no difficulties at all , to what I used to think . Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister . They are both delightful women , indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was ! "
87076	87094	86961	86961	Lucy	138	" Are you ill , Miss Dashwood?--you seem low -- you do n't speak;--sure you an't well . "
87095	87103	86961	86961	Lucy	138	" I never was in better health . "
87104	87155	86961	86961	Lucy	138	" I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it . I should be sorry to have YOU ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship . "--
87182	87322	87178	87178	she	138	" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward 's love , it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton 's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;-- and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me.-- They are such charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her , you can not speak too high . "
87343	87452	87340	87340	Lucy	138	" I am sure I should have seen it in a moment , if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me . If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way -- you know what I mean -- if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair . I could not have stood it . For where she DOES dislike , I know it is most violent . "
88070	88074	88075	88075	she	92	" Dear Edward ! "
88078	88094	88075	88075	she	92	" this is a moment of great happiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing ? "
88200	88209	88210	88210	she	92	" Oh , do n't think of me ! "
88227	88250	88210	88210	she	92	" do n't think of MY health . Elinor is well , you see . That must be enough for us both . "
88284	88290	88292	88292	Edward	96	" Do you like London ? "
88305	88349	88350	88350	She	92	" Not at all . I expected much pleasure in it , but I have found none . The sight of you , Edward , is the only comfort it has afforded ; and thank Heaven ! you are what you always were ! "
88357	88363	88364	88364	she	92	" I think , Elinor , "
88368	88414	88364	88364	she	92	" we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton . In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge . "
88463	88501	88508	88508	she	92	" We spent such a day , Edward , in Harley Street yesterday ! So dull , so wretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head , which can not be said now . "
88540	88554	88508	88508	she	92	" But why were you not there , Edward?--Why did you not come ? "
88555	88561	88513	88513	her	92	" I was engaged elsewhere . "
88562	88578	88508	88508	she	92	" Engaged ! But what was that , when such friends were to be met ? "
88579	88585	88587	88587	Lucy	138	" Perhaps , Miss Marianne , "
88597	88622	88587	88587	Lucy	138	" you think young men never stand upon engagements , if they have no mind to keep them , little as well as great . "
88642	88777	88638	88638	she	92	" Not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street . And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure . He is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body I ever saw . Edward , it is so , and I will say it . What ! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation . "
88826	88831	88833	88833	Marianne	92	" Going so soon ! "
88835	88845	88833	88833	Marianne	92	" my dear Edward , this must not be . "
88897	88906	88908	88908	Marianne	92	" What can bring her here so often ? "
88915	88929	88908	88908	Marianne	92	" Could not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teazing to Edward ! "
88930	88966	88967	88967	Marianne	92	" Why so?--we were all his friends , and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any . It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves . "
88976	89048	88967	88967	Marianne	92	" You know , Elinor , that this is a kind of talking which I can not bear . If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted , as I must suppose to be the case , you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it . I can not descend to be tricked out of assurances , that are not really wanted . "
90602	90623	90593	90593	she	92	" her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests . "
91154	91159	91160	91160	he	145	" Upon my soul , "
91163	91305	91160	91160	he	145	" I believe it is nothing more ; and so I often tell my mother , when she is grieving about it . ' My dear Madam , ' I always say to her , ' you must make yourself easy . The evil is now irremediable , and it has been entirely your own doing . Why would you be persuaded by my uncle , Sir Robert , against your own judgment , to place Edward under private tuition , at the most critical time of his life ? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself , instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt 's , all this would have been prevented . ' This is the way in which I always consider the matter , and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error . "
91347	91354	91355	91355	his	1967	" You reside in Devonshire , I think,"--was
91359	91366	91355	91355	his	1967	" in a cottage near Dawlish . "
91407	91413	91415	91415	he	1967	" For my own part , "
91417	91589	91415	91415	he	1967	" I am excessively fond of a cottage ; there is always so much comfort , so much elegance about them . And I protest , if I had any money to spare , I should buy a little land and build one myself , within a short distance of London , where I might drive myself down at any time , and collect a few friends about me , and be happy . I advise every body who is going to build , to build a cottage . My friend Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice , and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi 's . I was to decide on the best of them . ' My dear Courtland , ' said I , immediately throwing them all into the fire , ' do not adopt either of them , but by all means build a cottage . ' And that I fancy , will be the end of it .
91590	91827	91828	91828	Elinor	91	" Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations , no space in a cottage ; but this is all a mistake . I was last month at my friend Elliott 's , near Dartford . Lady Elliott wished to give a dance . ' But how can it be done ? ' said she ; ' my dear Ferrars , do tell me how it is to be managed . There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple , and where can the supper be ? ' I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it , so I said , ' My dear Lady Elliott , do not be uneasy . The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease ; card - tables may be placed in the drawing - room ; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments ; and let the supper be set out in the saloon . ' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought . We measured the dining - room , and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple , and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan . So that , in fact , you see , if people do but know how to set about it , every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling . "
91983	91994	91996	91996	she	95	" I do not see how it can be done , "
91998	92063	91996	91996	she	95	" without affronting Lady Middleton , for they spend every day with her ; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it . You know I am always ready to pay them any attention in my power , as my taking them out this evening shews . But they are Lady Middleton 's visitors . How can I ask them away from her ? "
92081	92115	92064	92065	Her husband	333	" They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit Street , and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations . "
92130	92260	92116	92116	Fanny	95	" My love I would ask them with all my heart , if it was in my power . But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us . They are very well behaved , good kind of girls ; and I think the attention is due to them , as their uncle did so very well by Edward . We can ask your sisters some other year , you know ; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more . I am sure you will like them ; indeed , you DO like them , you know , very much already , and so does my mother ; and they are such favourites with Harry ! "
92895	92909	92878	92878	her	91	" Lord ! my dear Miss Dashwood ! have you heard the news ? "
92910	92919	92845	92846	Mrs. Palmer	131	" No , ma'am . What is it ? "
92920	93205	92878	92878	her	91	" Something so strange ! But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr. Palmer 's , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child . She was sure it was very ill -- it cried , and fretted , and was all over pimples . So I looked at it directly , and , ' Lord ! my dear , ' says I , ' it is nothing in the world , but the red gum-- ' and nurse said just the same . But Charlotte , she would not be satisfied , so Mr. Donavan was sent for ; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street , so he stepped over directly , and as soon as ever he saw the child , be said just as we did , that it was nothing in the world but the red gum , and then Charlotte was easy . And so , just as he was going away again , it came into my head , I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it , but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news . So upon that , he smirked , and simpered , and looked grave , and seemed to know something or other , and at last he said in a whisper , ' For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister 's indisposition , I think it advisable to say , that I believe there is no great reason for alarm ; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will do very well . ' "
93206	93213	92845	92846	Mrs. Palmer	131	" What ! is Fanny ill ? "
93214	94167	92878	92878	her	91	" That is exactly what I said , my dear . ' Lord ! ' says I , ' is Mrs. Dashwood ill ? ' So then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all I can learn , seems to be this . Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ) , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There 's for you , my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it out directly . Well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;-- till this very morning , poor Nancy , who , you know , is a well - meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out . ' Lord ! ' thinks she to herself , ' they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ; ' and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet - work , little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord 's daughter or other , I forget who . So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride . She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother 's ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing - room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . So up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for Lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on . Poor soul ! I pity HER . And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit . Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes . THEN she fell into hysterics again , and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan , and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar . The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad . I declare , I have no patience with your sister ; and I hope , with all my heart , it will be a match in spite of her . Lord ! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it ! To have his love used so scornfully ! for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may . I should not wonder , if he was to be in the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same . He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care . I have no pity for either of them . I have no notion of people 's making such a to - do about money and greatness . There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a - year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . Lord ! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . "
94920	94938	94991	94991	she	92	" How long has this been known to you , Elinor ? has he written to you ? "
94939	94967	94991	94991	she	92	" I have known it these four months . When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November , she told me in confidence of her engagement . "
94993	95003	94991	94991	she	92	" Four months!--Have you known of this four months ? "
95008	95029	94991	94991	she	92	" What!--while attending me in all my misery , has this been on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!"--
95030	95047	94991	94991	she	92	" It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse ! "
95048	95050	94991	94991	she	92	" Four months!"--cried
95052	95059	94991	94991	she	92	again.--"So calm!-- so cheerful!--how have you been supported?"--
95060	95127	94991	94991	she	92	" By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to Lucy , obliged me to be secret . I owed it to her , therefore , to avoid giving any hint of the truth ; and I owed it to my family and friends , not to create in them a solicitude about me , which it could not be in my power to satisfy . "
95133	95146	95148	95148	Elinor	91	" I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother , "
95150	95172	95148	95148	Elinor	91	" and once or twice I have attempted it;-- but without betraying my trust , I never could have convinced you . "
95173	95179	94991	94991	she	92	" Four months!--and yet you loved him!"--
95180	95437	95148	95148	Elinor	91	" Yes . But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others was dear to me , I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt . Now , I can think and speak of it with little emotion . I would not have you suffer on my account ; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself . I have many things to support me . I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own , I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther . I acquit Edward of essential misconduct . I wish him very happy ; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty , that though now he may harbour some regret , in the end he must become so . Lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--And after all , Marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one 's happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant -- it is not fit -- it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edward will marry Lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER."--
95438	95447	95449	95449	Marianne	92	" If such is your way of thinking , "
95451	95497	95449	95449	Marianne	92	" if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else , your resolution , your self - command , are , perhaps , a little less to be wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension . "
95498	95852	95148	95148	Elinor	91	" I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For four months , Marianne , I have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as I thought , with triumph.-- This person 's suspicions , therefore , I have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling -- surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW . The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that I have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;-- they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No , Marianne.--THEN , if I had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely -- not even what I owed to my dearest friends -- from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy . "--
95857	95862	95863	95863	she	92	" Oh ! Elinor , "
95866	95936	95863	95863	she	92	" you have made me hate myself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!-- you , who have been my only comfort , who have borne with me in all my misery , who have seemed to be only suffering for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I can make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself , I have been trying to do it away . "
96087	96092	96095	96095	her	107	" Yes , ma'am . "--She
96182	96190	96192	96192	he	344	" You have heard , I suppose , "
96204	96218	96192	96192	he	344	" of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday . "
96234	96238	96239	96239	he	344	" Your sister , "
96242	96493	96239	96239	he	344	" has suffered dreadfully . Mrs. Ferrars too -- in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress -- but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome . Poor Fanny ! she was in hysterics all yesterday . But I would not alarm you too much . Donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended ; her constitution is a good one , and her resolution equal to any thing . She has borne it all , with the fortitude of an angel ! She says she never shall think well of anybody again ; and one can not wonder at it , after being so deceived!-- meeting with such ingratitude , where so much kindness had been shewn , so much confidence had been placed ! It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart , that she had asked these young women to her house ; merely because she thought they deserved some attention , were harmless , well - behaved girls , and would be pleasant companions ; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us , while your kind friend there , was attending her daughter . And now to be so rewarded ! ' I wish , with all my heart , ' says poor Fanny in her affectionate way , ' that we had asked your sisters instead of them . ' "
96509	96854	96505	96505	he	2018	" What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered , when first Fanny broke it to her , is not to be described . While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him , was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such a suspicion could never have entered her head ! If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere , it could not be in THAT quarter . ' THERE , to be sure , ' said she , ' I might have thought myself safe . ' She was quite in an agony . We consulted together , however , as to what should be done , and at last she determined to send for Edward . He came . But I am sorry to relate what ensued . All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement , assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments , and Fanny 's entreaties , was of no avail . Duty , affection , every thing was disregarded . I never thought Edward so stubborn , so unfeeling before . His mother explained to him her liberal designs , in case of his marrying Miss Morton ; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate , which , clear of land - tax , brings in a good thousand a - year ; offered even , when matters grew desperate , to make it twelve hundred ; and in opposition to this , if he still persisted in this low connection , represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match . His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all ; she would never see him again ; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance , that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support , she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it . "
96872	96881	96865	96865	her	92	" Gracious God ! can this be possible ! "
96882	96890	96892	96893	her brother	354	" Well may you wonder , Marianne , "
96895	96913	96892	96893	her brother	354	" at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these . Your exclamation is very natural . "
96929	96935	96936	96936	he	354	" All this , however , "
96939	96986	96936	96936	he	354	" was urged in vain . Edward said very little ; but what he did say , was in the most determined manner . Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement . He would stand to it , cost him what it might . "
96987	96990	96992	96993	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Then , "
97005	97082	96992	96993	Mrs. Jennings	107	" he has acted like an honest man ! I beg your pardon , Mr. Dashwood , but if he had done otherwise , I should have thought him a rascal . I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . "
97122	97290	97114	97114	He	2020	" I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours , madam . Miss Lucy Steele is , I dare say , a very deserving young woman , but in the present case you know , the connection must be impossible . And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle 's care , the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars , is perhaps , altogether a little extraordinary . In short , I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for , Mrs. Jennings . We all wish her extremely happy ; and Mrs. Ferrars 's conduct throughout the whole , has been such as every conscientious , good mother , in like circumstances , would adopt . It has been dignified and liberal . Edward has drawn his own lot , and I fear it will be a bad one . "
97325	97330	97332	97333	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Well , sir , "
97335	97342	97332	97333	Mrs. Jennings	107	" and how did it end ? "
97343	97402	97294	97294	her	92	" I am sorry to say , ma'am , in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother 's notice . He left her house yesterday , but where he is gone , or whether he is still in town , I do not know ; for WE of course can make no inquiry . "
97403	97414	97332	97333	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Poor young man!--and what is to become of him ? "
97415	97539	97294	97294	her	92	" What , indeed , ma'am ! It is a melancholy consideration . Born to the prospect of such affluence ! I can not conceive a situation more deplorable . The interest of two thousand pounds -- how can a man live on it?--and when to that is added the recollection , that he might , but for his own folly , within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand , five hundred a - year ( for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds , ) I can not picture to myself a more wretched condition . We must all feel for him ; and the more so , because it is totally out of our power to assist him . "
97540	97545	97547	97548	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Poor young man ! "
97550	97600	97547	97548	Mrs. Jennings	107	" I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him . It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns . "
97624	97636	97638	97639	John Dashwood	90	" If he would only have done as well by himself , "
97641	97750	97638	97639	John Dashwood	90	" as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing . But as it is , it must be out of anybody 's power to assist him . And there is one thing more preparing against him , which must be worse than all -- his mother has determined , with a very natural kind of spirit , to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately , which might have been Edward 's , on proper conditions . I left her this morning with her lawyer , talking over the business . "
97751	97754	97756	97757	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Well ! "
97759	97794	97756	97757	Mrs. Jennings	107	" that is HER revenge . Everybody has a way of their own . But I do n't think mine would be , to make one son independent , because another had plagued me . "
97804	97817	97819	97819	John	90	" Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man , "
97821	97849	97819	97819	John	90	" than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own ? Poor Edward ! I feel for him sincerely . "
98588	98618	98581	98582	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Get it all out of her , my dear . She will tell you any thing if you ask . You see I can not leave Mrs. Clarke . "
98653	98662	98664	98665	Miss Steele	138	" I am so glad to meet you ; "
98672	98685	98689	98689	her	91	arm--"for I wanted to see you of all things in the world . "
98692	98707	98689	98689	her	91	" I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it . Is she angry ? "
98708	98719	98689	98689	her	91	" Not at all , I believe , with you . "
98720	98735	98689	98689	her	91	" That is a good thing . And Lady Middleton , is SHE angry ? "
98736	98747	98689	98689	her	91	" I can not suppose it possible that she should . "
98748	98933	98934	98934	She	2041	" I am monstrous glad of it . Good gracious ! I have had such a time of it ! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life . She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet , nor do any thing else for me again , so long as she lived ; but now she is quite come to , and we are as good friends as ever . Look , she made me this bow to my hat , and put in the feather last night . There now , YOU are going to laugh at me too . But why should not I wear pink ribbons ? I do not care if it IS the Doctor 's favourite colour . I am sure , for my part , I should never have known he DID like it better than any other colour , if he had not happened to say so . My cousins have been so plaguing me ! I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them . "
98965	98972	98934	98934	She	2041	" Well , but Miss Dashwood , "
98976	99047	98934	98934	She	2041	" people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars 's declaring he would not have Lucy , for it is no such thing I can tell you ; and it is quite a shame for such ill - natured reports to be spread abroad . Whatever Lucy might think about it herself , you know , it was no business of other people to set it down for certain . "
99048	99065	99067	99067	Elinor	91	" I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before , I assure you , "
99069	99839	98934	98934	She	2041	" Oh , did not you ? But it WAS said , I know , very well , and by more than one ; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks , that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton , with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune , for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all ; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself . And besides that , my cousin Richard said himself , that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off ; and when Edward did not come near us for three days , I could not tell what to think myself ; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost ; for we came away from your brother 's Wednesday , and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday , Friday , and Saturday , and did not know what was become of him . Once Lucy thought to write to him , but then her spirits rose against that . However this morning he came just as we came home from church ; and then it all came out , how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street , and been talked to by his mother and all of them , and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy , and nobody but Lucy would he have . And how he had been so worried by what passed , that as soon as he had went away from his mother 's house , he had got upon his horse , and rid into the country , some where or other ; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday , on purpose to get the better of it . And after thinking it all over and over again , he said , it seemed to him as if , now he had no fortune , and no nothing at all , it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement , because it must be for her loss , for he had nothing but two thousand pounds , and no hope of any thing else ; and if he was to go into orders , as he had some thoughts , he could get nothing but a curacy , and how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear to think of her doing no better , and so he begged , if she had the least mind for it , to put an end to the matter directly , and leave him shift for himself . I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be . And it was entirely for HER sake , and upon HER account , that he said a word about being off , and not upon his own . I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her , or of wishing to marry Miss Morton , or any thing like it . But , to be sure , Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking ; so she told him directly ( with a great deal about sweet and love , you know , and all that -- Oh , la ! one ca n't repeat such kind of things you know)--she told him directly , she had not the least mind in the world to be off , for she could live with him upon a trifle , and how little so ever he might have , she should be very glad to have it all , you know , or something of the kind . So then he was monstrous happy , and talked on some time about what they should do , and they agreed he should take orders directly , and they must wait to be married till he got a living . And just then I could not hear any more , for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach , and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens ; so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them , to ask Lucy if she would like to go , but she did not care to leave Edward ; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons . "
99840	99852	99854	99854	Elinor	91	" I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them , "
99856	99870	99854	99854	Elinor	91	" you were all in the same room together , were not you ? "
99871	99939	98934	98934	She	2041	" No , indeed , not us . La ! Miss Dashwood , do you think people make love when any body else is by ? Oh , for shame!--To be sure you must know better than that . ( Laughing affectedly.)--No , no ; they were shut up in the drawing - room together , and all I heard was only by listening at the door . "
99940	99943	99945	99945	Elinor	91	" How ! "
99947	100009	99945	99945	Elinor	91	" have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door ? I am sorry I did not know it before ; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself . How could you behave so unfairly by your sister ? "
100010	100092	98934	98934	She	2041	" Oh , la ! there is nothing in THAT . I only stood at the door , and heard what I could . And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me ; for a year or two back , when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together , she never made any bones of hiding in a closet , or behind a chimney - board , on purpose to hear what we said . "
100122	100131	100133	100133	she	91	" Edward talks of going to Oxford soon , "
100135	100402	100133	100133	she	91	" but now he is lodging at No . -- , Pall Mall . What an ill - natured woman his mother is , an't she ? And your brother and sister were not very kind ! However , I sha n't say anything against them to YOU ; and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot , which was more than I looked for . And for my part , I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before ; but , however , nothing was said about them , and I took care to keep mine out of sight . Edward have got some business at Oxford , he says ; so he must go there for a time ; and after THAT , as soon as he can light upon a Bishop , he will be ordained . I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious ! ( giggling as she spoke ) I 'd lay my life I know what my cousins will say , when they hear of it . They will tell me I should write to the Doctor , to get Edward the curacy of his new living . I know they will ; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.-- ' La ! ' I shall say directly , ' I wonder how you could think of such a thing ? I write to the Doctor , indeed ! ' "
100403	100406	100408	100408	Elinor	91	" Well , "
100410	100429	100408	100408	Elinor	91	" it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst . You have got your answer ready . "
100453	100643	100430	100431	Miss Steele	138	" Oh , la ! here come the Richardsons . I had a vast deal more to say to you , but I must not stay away from them not any longer . I assure you they are very genteel people . He makes a monstrous deal of money , and they keep their own coach . I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . I suppose Lady Middleton wo n't ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here . Remember me kindly to her . La ! if you have not got your spotted muslin on!--I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn . "
100878	101004	100871	100872	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Wait for his having a living!--ay , we all know how THAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth , and finding no good comes of it , will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a - year , with the interest of his two thousand pounds , and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her.--Then they will have a child every year ! and Lord help 'em ! how poor they will be!--I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house . Two maids and two men , indeed!--as I talked of t'other day.--No , no , they must get a stout girl of all works.-- Betty 's sister would never do for them NOW . "
101027	101033	101491	101491	she	91	" Bartlett 's Building , March .
101034	101472	101491	101491	she	91	" I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her ; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward , after all the troubles we have went through lately , therefore will make no more apologies , but proceed to say that , thank God ! though we have suffered dreadfully , we are both quite well now , and as happy as we must always be in one another 's love . We have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember , as will Edward too , who I have told of it . I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother 's anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs. Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr. Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us.--Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs. Jennings wo n't think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ' twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne ,
101473	101479	101491	101491	she	91	" I am , & c. "
101523	101650	101491	101491	she	91	" Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye , that was quite proper to let him be off if he would . That was just like Lucy.--Poor soul ! I wish I COULD get him a living , with all my heart.--She calls me dear Mrs. Jennings , you see . She is a good - hearted girl as ever lived.--Very well upon my word . That sentence is very prettily turned . Yes , yes , I will go and see her , sure enough . How attentive she is , to think of every body!--Thank you , my dear , for shewing it me . It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw , and does Lucy 's head and heart great credit . "
101941	101942	101933	101933	her	107	" Cleveland!"--she
101949	101959	101933	101933	her	107	" No , I can not go to Cleveland . "--
101960	101964	101966	101966	Elinor	91	" You forget , "
101969	101985	101966	101966	Elinor	91	" that its situation is not ... that it is not in the neighbourhood of ... "
101986	102018	101933	101933	her	107	" But it is in Somersetshire.--I can not go into Somersetshire.--There , where I looked forward to going ... No , Elinor , you can not expect me to go there . "
102275	102293	102301	102301	he	6	" Ah ! Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods;"--was
102312	102348	102310	102310	her	107	settled--"for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back!--Lord ! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats . "
102678	102690	102673	102674	the Colonel	108	" I am afraid it can not take place very soon . "
102710	102716	102702	102702	she	107	" Lord ! what should hinder it?"--but
102728	102741	102781	102782	Mrs. Jennings	107	" This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older . "
102802	102814	102799	102799	she	91	" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you . "
102889	102894	102896	102896	he	686	" I have heard , "
102902	102950	102896	102896	he	686	" of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?-- "
102958	102964	102951	102951	Elinor	91	" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty,"--he
102969	103231	102951	102951	Elinor	91	feeling,--"of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to . I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street , and am much pleased with him . He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , I wish it still more . I understand that he intends to take orders . Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford , now just vacant , as I am informed by this day 's post , is his , if he think it worth his acceptance -- but THAT , perhaps , so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now , it may be nonsense to appear to doubt ; I only wish it were more valuable.-- It is a rectory , but a small one ; the late incumbent , I believe , did not make more than 200 L per annum , and though it is certainly capable of improvement , I fear , not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income . Such as it is , however , my pleasure in presenting him to it , will be very great . Pray assure him of it . "
103609	103616	103618	103618	she	91	" The smallness of the house , "
103620	103642	103618	103618	she	91	" I can not imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income . "
103700	103851	103696	103696	he	686	" This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it can not enable him to marry . I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive . If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present . What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness . His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least , I am afraid it can not take place very soon.-- "
103930	103936	103938	103939	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Well , Miss Dashwood , "
103952	104018	103938	103939	Mrs. Jennings	107	" I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you ; for though , upon my honour , I TRIED to keep out of hearing , I could not help catching enough to understand his business . And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life , and I wish you joy of it with all my heart . "
104019	104025	104027	104027	Elinor	91	" Thank you , ma'am , "
104029	104082	104027	104027	Elinor	91	" It is a matter of great joy to me ; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly . There are not many men who would act as he has done . Few people who have so compassionate a heart ! I never was more astonished in my life . "
104083	104121	103938	103939	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Lord ! my dear , you are very modest . I an't the least astonished at it in the world , for I have often thought of late , there was nothing more likely to happen . "
104122	104151	104027	104027	Elinor	91	" You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel 's general benevolence ; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur . "
104152	104155	104157	104158	Mrs. Jennings--"Oh	220	" Opportunity ! "
104158	104227	104027	104027	Elinor	91	Jennings--"Oh ! as to that , when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing , somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity . Well , my dear , I wish you joy of it again and again ; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world , I think I shall soon know where to look for them . "
104228	104240	104242	104242	Elinor	91	" You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose , "
104249	104294	104027	104027	Elinor	91	" Aye , my dear , that I do , indeed . And as to the house being a bad one , I do not know what the Colonel would be at , for it is as good a one as ever I saw . "
104295	104305	104027	104027	Elinor	91	" He spoke of its being out of repair . "
104306	104328	104027	104027	Elinor	91	" Well , and whose fault is that ? why do n't he repair it?-- who should do it but himself ? "
104356	104437	104027	104027	Elinor	91	" Well , my dear , I must be gone before I have had half my talk out . But , however , we may have it all over in the evening ; for we shall be quite alone . I do not ask you to go with me , for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company ; and besides , you must long to tell your sister all about it . "
104448	104473	104027	104027	Elinor	91	" Certainly , ma'am , I shall tell Marianne of it ; but I shall not mention it at present to any body else . "
104474	104480	104482	104483	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Oh ! very well , "
104487	104512	104482	104483	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy , for I think of going as far as Holborn to - day . "
104513	104590	104027	104027	Elinor	91	" No , ma'am , not even Lucy if you please . One day 's delay will not be very material ; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars , I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else . I shall do THAT directly . It is of importance that no time should be lost with him , for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination . "
104639	104716	104637	104637	she	107	" Oh , ho!--I understand you . Mr. Ferrars is to be the man . Well , so much the better for him . Ay , to be sure , he must be ordained in readiness ; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you . But , my dear , is not this rather out of character ? Should not the Colonel write himself?--sure , he is the proper person . "
104747	104772	104732	104732	she	91	" Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man , that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself . "
104773	104839	104732	104732	she	91	" And so YOU are forced to do it . Well THAT is an odd kind of delicacy ! However , I will not disturb you ( seeing her preparing to write . ) You know your own concerns best . So goodby , my dear . I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed . "
104852	104924	104732	104732	she	91	" I have just been thinking of Betty 's sister , my dear . I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress . But whether she would do for a lady 's maid , I am sure I ca n't tell . She is an excellent housemaid , and works very well at her needle . However , you will think of all that at your leisure . "
104925	104930	104932	104932	Elinor	91	" Certainly , ma'am , "
105291	105297	105299	105299	he	96	" Mrs. Jennings told me , "
105301	105385	105299	105299	he	96	" that you wished to speak with me , at least I understood her so -- or I certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner ; though at the same time , I should have been extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister ; especially as it will most likely be some time -- it is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again . I go to Oxford tomorrow . "
105386	105395	105397	105397	Elinor	91	" You would not have gone , however , "
105417	105609	105408	105408	she	91	" without receiving our good wishes , even if we had not been able to give them in person . Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said . I have something of consequence to inform you of , which I was on the point of communicating by paper . I am charged with a most agreeable office ( breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke . ) Colonel Brandon , who was here only ten minutes ago , has desired me to say , that understanding you mean to take orders , he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant , and only wishes it were more valuable . Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well - judging a friend , and to join in his wish that the living -- it is about two hundred a - year -- were much more considerable , and such as might better enable you to -- as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself -- such , in short , as might establish all your views of happiness . "
105664	105668	105657	105657	he	96	" Colonel Brandon ! "
105669	105672	105674	105674	Elinor	91	" Yes , "
105688	105765	105674	105674	Elinor	91	" Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed -- for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you -- a concern which I am sure Marianne , myself , and all your friends , must share ; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character , and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion . "
105766	105777	105657	105657	he	96	" Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can it be possible ? "
105778	105795	105674	105674	Elinor	91	" The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where . "
105796	105799	105657	105657	he	96	" No , "
105807	105856	105657	105657	he	96	" not to find it in YOU ; for I can not be ignorant that to you , to your goodness , I owe it all.--I feel it -- I would express it if I could -- but , as you well know , I am no orator . "
105857	105978	105674	105674	Elinor	91	" You are very much mistaken . I do assure you that you owe it entirely , at least almost entirely , to your own merit , and Colonel Brandon 's discernment of it . I have had no hand in it . I did not even know , till I understood his design , that the living was vacant ; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift . As a friend of mine , of my family , he may , perhaps -- indeed I know he HAS , still greater pleasure in bestowing it ; but , upon my word , you owe nothing to my solicitation . "
106061	106107	106058	106058	he	96	" Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability . I have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother I know esteems him highly . He is undoubtedly a sensible man , and in his manners perfectly the gentleman . "
106108	106111	106113	106113	Elinor	91	" Indeed , "
106115	106173	106113	106113	Elinor	91	" I believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house , ) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this . "
106224	106237	106239	106239	he	96	" Colonel Brandon , I think , lodges in St. James Street , "
106258	106296	106249	106249	Elinor	91	" I must hurry away then , to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU ; to assure him that he has made me a very -- an exceedingly happy man . "
106356	106363	106365	106365	Elinor	91	" When I see him again , "
106376	106386	106367	106367	herself	91	" I shall see him the husband of Lucy . "
106491	106497	106498	106498	she	91	" Well , my dear , "
106501	106536	106498	106498	she	91	" I sent you up to the young man . Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty -- You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ? "
106537	106548	106450	106450	she	107	" No , ma'am ; THAT was not very likely . "
106549	106567	106498	106498	she	91	" Well , and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon that . "
106568	106571	106573	106573	Elinor	91	" Really , "
106575	106614	106573	106573	Elinor	91	" I know so little of these kind of forms , that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time , or the preparation necessary ; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination . "
106615	106621	106623	106624	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Two or three months ! "
106626	106713	106623	106624	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Lord ! my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months ! Lord bless me!--I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars , I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him . Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already . "
106714	106719	106721	106721	Elinor	91	" My dear ma'am , "
106723	106746	106721	106721	Elinor	91	" what can you be thinking of?-- Why , Colonel Brandon 's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . "
106747	106778	106623	106624	Mrs. Jennings	107	" Lord bless you , my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars ! "
106835	106848	106850	106850	she	107	" Aye , aye , the parsonage is but a small one , "
106863	106964	106850	106850	she	107	" and very likely MAY be out of repair ; but to hear a man apologising , as I thought , for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground - floor , and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!-- and to you too , that had been used to live in Barton cottage!-- It seems quite ridiculous . But , my dear , we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before Lucy goes to it . "
106965	106988	107057	107057	Elinor	91	" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living 's being enough to allow them to marry . "
106989	107056	106850	106850	she	107	" The Colonel is a ninny , my dear ; because he has two thousand a - year himself , he thinks that nobody else can marry on less . Take my word for it , that , if I am alive , I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas ; and I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there . "
107641	107652	107706	107706	Elinor	91	" Fanny is in her own room , I suppose , "
107654	107705	107706	107706	Elinor	91	he:--"I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it , indeed . NOW especially there can not be -- but however , you and Marianne were always great favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?"--
107715	107725	107726	107726	he	2127	" I am not sorry to see you alone , "
107729	107776	107726	107726	he	2127	" for I have a good deal to say to you . This living of Colonel Brandon's -- can it be true?--has he really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it . "
107777	107792	107706	107706	Elinor	91	" It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward . "
107793	107817	107726	107726	he	2127	" Really!--Well , this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no connection between them!--and now that livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this ? "
107818	107825	107706	107706	Elinor	91	" About two hundred a year . "
107826	107994	107726	107726	he	2127	" Very well -- and for the next presentation to a living of that value -- supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly , and likely to vacate it soon -- he might have got I dare say -- fourteen hundred pounds . And how came he not to have settled that matter before this person 's death?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it , but a man of Colonel Brandon 's sense!--I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common , such natural , concern!--Well , I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character . I suppose , however -- on recollection -- that the case may probably be THIS . Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation , is old enough to take it.--Aye , aye , that is the fact , depend upon it . "
108045	108049	108055	108055	she	91	" It is truly astonishing!"--he
108056	108064	108144	108144	she	91	said--"what could be the Colonel 's motive ? "
108065	108079	108144	108144	she	91	" A very simple one -- to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . "
108080	108132	108144	108144	she	91	" Well , well ; whatever Colonel Brandon may be , Edward is a very lucky man.--You will not mention the matter to Fanny , however , for though I have broke it to her , and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear it much talked of . "
108173	108177	108179	108179	he	354	" Mrs. Ferrars , "
108193	108235	108179	108179	he	354	" knows nothing about it at present , and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.-- When the marriage takes place , I fear she must hear of it all . "
108236	108382	108182	108182	his	354	" But why should such precaution be used?--Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be quite out of the question ; yet why , upon her late behaviour , is she supposed to feel at all?--She has done with her son , she cast him off for ever , and has made all those over whom she had any influence , cast him off likewise . Surely , after doing so , she can not be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account-- she can not be interested in any thing that befalls him.-- She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child , and yet retain the anxiety of a parent ! "
108383	108388	108390	108390	John	90	" Ah ! Elinor , "
108392	108467	108390	108390	John	90	" your reasoning is very good , but it is founded on ignorance of human nature . When Edward 's unhappy match takes place , depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him ; and , therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event , must be concealed from her as much as possible . Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son . "
108468	108487	108182	108182	his	354	" You surprise me ; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time . "
108488	108507	108390	108390	John	90	" You wrong her exceedingly . Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world . "
108512	108515	108516	108517	Mr. Dashwood	87	" We think NOW,"--said
108524	108532	108516	108517	Mr. Dashwood	87	" of ROBERT 'S marrying Miss Morton . "
108551	108565	108182	108182	his	354	" The lady , I suppose , has no choice in the affair . "
108566	108572	108182	108182	his	354	" Choice!--how do you mean ? "
108573	108602	108182	108182	his	354	" I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert . "
108603	108653	108182	108182	his	354	" Certainly , there can be no difference ; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;--and as to any thing else , they are both very agreeable young men : I do not know that one is superior to the other . "
108672	108681	108182	108182	his	354	" Of ONE thing , my dear sister , "
108692	108983	108182	108182	his	354	whisper,--"I may assure you;-- and I WILL do it , because I know it must gratify you . I have good reason to think -- indeed I have it from the best authority , or I should not repeat it , for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it -- but I have it from the very best authority -- not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself -- but her daughter DID , and I have it from her -- That in short , whatever objections there might be against a certain -- a certain connection -- you understand me -- it would have been far preferable to her , it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does . I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light-- a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all . ' It would have been beyond comparison , ' she said , ' the least evil of the two , and she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse . ' But however , all that is quite out of the question -- not to be thought of or mentioned-- as to any attachment you know -- it never could be -- all that is gone by . But I thought I would just tell you of this , because I knew how much it must please you . Not that you have any reason to regret , my dear Elinor . There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well -- quite as well , or better , perhaps , all things considered . Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately ? "
109377	109386	109388	109388	he	96	" We may treat it as a joke , "
109408	109705	109388	109388	he	96	moment--"but , upon my soul , it is a most serious business . Poor Edward ! he is ruined for ever . I am extremely sorry for it-- for I know him to be a very good - hearted creature ; as well - meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world . You must not judge of him , Miss Dashwood , from YOUR slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born , you know , with the same powers,--the same address.-- Poor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!-- to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul , I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom ; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life , as when it all burst forth . I could not believe it.-- My mother was the first person who told me of it ; and I , feeling myself called on to act with resolution , immediately said to her , ' My dear madam , I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion , but as for myself , I must say , that if Edward does marry this young woman , I never will see him again . ' That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society!--but , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected . My poor mother was half frantic . "
109706	109714	109388	109388	he	96	" Have you ever seen the lady ? "
109715	109979	109980	109980	He	2142	" Yes ; once , while she was staying in this house , I happened to drop in for ten minutes ; and I saw quite enough of her . The merest awkward country girl , without style , or elegance , and almost without beauty.-- I remember her perfectly . Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward . I offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late THEN , I found , to do any thing , for unluckily , I was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere . But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier -- I think it is most probable -- that something might have been hit on . I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light . ' My dear fellow , ' I should have said , ' consider what you are doing . You are making a most disgraceful connection , and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving . ' I can not help thinking , in short , that means might have been found . But now it is all too late . He must be starved , you know;-- that is certain ; absolutely starved . "

113749	113778	113734	113735	the other	794	" but she will be here , I hope , before it is long . It is a great way , you know , from hence to Barton . "
113779	113789	113791	113791	Marianne	92	" But she must not go round by London , "
113799	113812	113791	113791	Marianne	92	" I shall never see her , if she goes by London . "

116191	116196	116197	116197	she	91	" No , sir , "
116202	116235	116197	116197	she	91	" I shall NOT stay . Your business can not be with ME . The servants , I suppose , forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house . "

116248	116281	116243	116243	he	110	" that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil , it would not have turned me from the door . My business is with you , and only you . "
116282	116284	116197	116197	she	91	" With me!"--in

116420	116428	116417	116417	Elinor	91	" I have no time to spare . "
116446	116450	116452	116452	he	110	" Your sister , "
116459	116483	116452	116452	he	110	afterwards--"is out of danger . I heard it from the servant . God be praised!--But is it true ? is it really true ? "
116498	116517	116489	116489	He	110	" For God 's sake tell me , is she out of danger , or is she not ? "

116598	116610	116596	116596	his	110	" do you think me most a knave or a fool ? "
116657	116700	116651	116651	she	91	" Mr. Willoughby , I advise you at present to return to Combe -- I am not at leisure to remain with you longer.-- Whatever your business may be with me , will it be better recollected and explained to - morrow . "
116701	116706	116707	116707	he	110	" I understand you , "
116721	116746	116707	116707	he	110	" yes , I am very drunk.-- A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was enough to over - set me . "
116747	116749	116802	116802	his	110	" At Marlborough!"--cried
116766	116798	116809	116809	his	110	" Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o'clock , and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough . "
116846	116892	116837	116837	she	91	" Mr. Willoughby , you OUGHT to feel , and I certainly DO -- that after what has passed -- your coming here in this manner , and forcing yourself upon my notice , requires a very particular excuse.--What is it , that you mean by it?"--
116893	116895	116896	116896	he	110	" I mean,"--said
116900	116977	116837	116837	she	91	energy--"if I can , to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW . I mean to offer some kind of explanation , some kind of apology , for the past ; to open my whole heart to you , and by convincing you , that though I have been always a blockhead , I have not been always a rascal , to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma -- from your sister . "
116978	116988	116837	116837	she	91	" Is this the real reason of your coming ? "
116989	116994	116995	116995	his	110	" Upon my soul it is,"--was
117022	117043	116837	116837	she	91	" If that is all , you may be satisfied already,-- for Marianne DOES -- she has LONG forgiven you . "
117044	117046	116995	116995	his	110	" Has she?"--he
117054	117086	116995	116995	his	110	" Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it . But she shall forgive me again , and on more reasonable grounds.--NOW will you listen to me ? "
117092	117098	117100	117100	he	110	" I do not know , "
117115	117328	117114	117114	his	110	own,--"how YOU may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister , or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.-- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is worth the trial however , and you shall hear every thing . When I first became intimate in your family , I had no other intention , no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire , more pleasantly than I had ever done before . Your sister 's lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me ; and her behaviour to me almost from the first , was of a kind -- It is astonishing , when I reflect on what it was , and what SHE was , that my heart should have been so insensible ! But at first I must confess , my vanity only was elevated by it . Careless of her happiness , thinking only of my own amusement , giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging , I endeavoured , by every means in my power , to make myself pleasing to her , without any design of returning her affection . "
117353	117403	117337	117337	her	86	" It is hardly worth while , Mr. Willoughby , for you to relate , or for me to listen any longer . Such a beginning as this can not be followed by any thing.-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject . "
117404	117415	117416	117416	he	2352	" I insist on you hearing the whole of it , "
117419	117707	117416	117416	he	2352	" My fortune was never large , and I had always been expensive , always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself . Every year since my coming of age , or even before , I believe , had added to my debts ; and though the death of my old cousin , Mrs. Smith , was to set me free ; yet that event being uncertain , and possibly far distant , it had been for some time my intention to re - establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune . To attach myself to your sister , therefore , was not a thing to be thought of;--and with a meanness , selfishness , cruelty-- which no indignant , no contemptuous look , even of yours , Miss Dashwood , can ever reprobate too much -- I was acting in this manner , trying to engage her regard , without a thought of returning it.--But one thing may be said for me : even in that horrid state of selfish vanity , I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated , because I did not THEN know what it was to love . But have I ever known it?--Well may it be doubted ; for , had I really loved , could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity , to avarice?--or , what is more , could I have sacrificed hers?-- But I have done it . To avoid a comparative poverty , which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors , I have , by raising myself to affluence , lost every thing that could make it a blessing . "
117708	117713	117715	117715	Elinor	91	" You did then , "
117721	117731	117715	117715	Elinor	91	" believe yourself at one time attached to her ? "
117732	118018	118019	118019	he	2353	" To have resisted such attractions , to have withstood such tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have done it?--Yes , I found myself , by insensible degrees , sincerely fond of her ; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable , and my feelings blameless . Even THEN , however , when fully determined on paying my addresses to her , I allowed myself most improperly to put off , from day to day , the moment of doing it , from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed . I will not reason here -- nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity , and the worse than absurdity , of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound . The event has proved , that I was a cunning fool , providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever . At last , however , my resolution was taken , and I had determined , as soon as I could engage her alone , to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her , and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display . But in the interim -- in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass , before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private-- a circumstance occurred -- an unlucky circumstance , to ruin all my resolution , and with it all my comfort . A discovery took place,"--here
118023	118066	118067	118067	he	2353	down.--"Mrs . Smith had somehow or other been informed , I imagine by some distant relation , whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour , of an affair , a connection -- but I need not explain myself farther , "
118080	118094	118067	118067	he	2353	eye--"your particular intimacy -- you have probably heard the whole story long ago . "
118095	118099	118101	118101	Elinor	91	" I have , "
118117	118147	118101	118101	Elinor	91	" I have heard it all . And how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business , I confess is beyond my comprehension . "
118148	118151	118153	118153	Willoughby	110	" Remember , "
118155	118344	118153	118153	Willoughby	110	" from whom you received the account . Could it be an impartial one ? I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me . I do not mean to justify myself , but at the same time can not leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge -- that because she was injured she was irreproachable , and because I was a libertine , SHE must be a saint . If the violence of her passions , the weakness of her understanding -- I do not mean , however , to defend myself . Her affection for me deserved better treatment , and I often , with great self - reproach , recall the tenderness which , for a very short time , had the power of creating any return . I wish -- I heartily wish it had never been . But I have injured more than herself ; and I have injured one , whose affection for me--(may I say it ? ) was scarcely less warm than hers ; and whose mind -- Oh ! how infinitely superior!"--
118345	118445	118101	118101	Elinor	91	" Your indifference , however , towards that unfortunate girl -- I must say it , unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be -- your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her . Do not think yourself excused by any weakness , any natural defect of understanding on her side , in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours . You must have known , that while you were enjoying yourself in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes , always gay , always happy , she was reduced to the extremest indigence . "
118446	118459	118460	118460	he	2355	" But , upon my soul , I did NOT know it , "
118464	118492	118460	118460	he	2355	" I did not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction ; and common sense might have told her how to find it out . "
118493	118504	118101	118101	Elinor	91	" Well , sir , and what said Mrs. Smith ? "
118505	118925	118460	118460	he	2355	" She taxed me with the offence at once , and my confusion may be guessed . The purity of her life , the formality of her notions , her ignorance of the world -- every thing was against me . The matter itself I could not deny , and vain was every endeavour to soften it . She was previously disposed , I believe , to doubt the morality of my conduct in general , and was moreover discontented with the very little attention , the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her , in my present visit . In short , it ended in a total breach . By one measure I might have saved myself . In the height of her morality , good woman ! she offered to forgive the past , if I would marry Eliza . That could not be -- and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house . The night following this affair -- I was to go the next morning-- was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be . The struggle was great -- but it ended too soon . My affection for Marianne , my thorough conviction of her attachment to me -- it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty , or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches , which I was naturally inclined to feel , and expensive society had increased . I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife , if I chose to address her , and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do . A heavy scene however awaited me , before I could leave Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day ; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement . But whether I should write this apology , or deliver it in person , was a point of long debate . To see Marianne , I felt , would be dreadful , and I even doubted whether I could see her again , and keep to my resolution . In that point , however , I undervalued my own magnanimity , as the event declared ; for I went , I saw her , and saw her miserable , and left her miserable -- and left her hoping never to see her again . "
118926	118935	118937	118937	Elinor	91	" Why did you call , Mr. Willoughby ? "
118941	118956	118937	118937	Elinor	91	" a note would have answered every purpose.-- Why was it necessary to call ? "
118957	119197	118460	118460	he	2355	" It was necessary to my own pride . I could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you , or the rest of the neighbourhood , to suspect any part of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself-- and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage , in my way to Honiton . The sight of your dear sister , however , was really dreadful ; and , to heighten the matter , I found her alone . You were all gone I do not know where . I had left her only the evening before , so fully , so firmly resolved within my self on doing right ! A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever ; and I remember how happy , how gay were my spirits , as I walked from the cottage to Allenham , satisfied with myself , delighted with every body ! But in this , our last interview of friendship , I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling . Her sorrow , her disappointment , her deep regret , when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately -- I never shall forget it -- united too with such reliance , such confidence in me!--Oh , God!--what a hard - hearted rascal I was ! "
119211	119222	118460	118460	he	2355	" Did you tell her that you should soon return ? "
119223	119233	119234	119234	he	2357	" I do not know what I told her , "
119239	119438	119234	119234	he	2357	" less than was due to the past , beyond a doubt , and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future . I can not think of it.--It wo n't do.--Then came your dear mother to torture me farther , with all her kindness and confidence . Thank Heaven ! it DID torture me . I was miserable . Miss Dashwood , you can not have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery . I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid , rascally folly of my own heart , that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now . Well , I went , left all that I loved , and went to those to whom , at best , I was only indifferent . My journey to town -- travelling with my own horses , and therefore so tediously -- no creature to speak to -- my own reflections so cheerful -- when I looked forward every thing so inviting!--when I looked back at Barton , the picture so soothing!--oh , it was a blessed journey ! "
119442	119447	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" Well , sir , "
119463	119469	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" and this is all ? "
119470	119488	119234	119234	he	2357	" Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?-- That infamous letter -- Did she shew it you ? "
119489	119499	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" Yes , I saw every note that passed . "
119500	119633	119234	119234	he	2357	" When the first of hers reached me ( as it immediately did , for I was in town the whole time , ) what I felt is-- in the common phrase , not to be expressed ; in a more simple one -- perhaps too simple to raise any emotion-- my feelings were very , very painful.--Every line , every word was -- in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer , were she here , would forbid -- a dagger to my heart . To know that Marianne was in town was -- in the same language-- a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste , her opinions -- I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure they are dearer . "
119671	119698	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" This is not right , Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that you are married . Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear . "
119699	120001	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" Marianne 's note , by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse . I say awakened , because time and London , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and I had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me ; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , ' I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married . '-- But this note made me know myself better . I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that I was using her infamously . But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me . To retreat was impossible . All that I had to do , was to avoid you both . I sent no answer to Marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street;--but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , I watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name . "
120002	120010	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" Watched us out of the house ! "
120011	120546	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" Even so . You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you , how often I was on the point of falling in with you . I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight , as the carriage drove by . Lodging as I did in Bond Street , there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you ; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side , a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight , could have separated us so long . I avoided the Middletons as much as possible , as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common . Not aware of their being in town , however , I blundered on Sir John , I believe , the first day of his coming , and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings 's . He asked me to a party , a dance at his house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there , I should have felt it too certain a thing , to trust myself near him . The next morning brought another short note from Marianne-- still affectionate , open , artless , confiding -- everything that could make MY conduct most hateful . I could not answer it . I tried -- but could not frame a sentence . But I thought of her , I believe , every moment of the day . If you CAN pity me , Miss Dashwood , pity my situation as it was THEN . With my head and heart full of your sister , I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those three or four weeks were worse than all . Well , at last , as I need not tell you , you were forced on me ; and what a sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!-- Marianne , beautiful as an angel on one side , calling me Willoughby in such a tone!--Oh , God!--holding out her hand to me , asking me for an explanation , with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and Sophia , jealous as the devil on the other hand , looking all that was -- Well , it does not signify ; it is over now.-- Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could ; but not before I had seen Marianne 's sweet face as white as death.--THAT was the last , last look I ever had of her;-- the last manner in which she appeared to me . It was a horrid sight!--yet when I thought of her to - day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world . She was before me , constantly before me , as I travelled , in the same look and hue . "
120564	120586	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" Well , let me make haste and be gone . Your sister is certainly better , certainly out of danger ? "
120587	120594	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" We are assured of it . "
120595	120604	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" Your poor mother , too!--doting on Marianne . "
120605	120626	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" But the letter , Mr. Willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to say about that ? "
120627	120848	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" Yes , yes , THAT in particular . Your sister wrote to me again , you know , the very next morning . You saw what she said . I was breakfasting at the Ellisons,--and her letter , with some others , was brought to me there from my lodgings . It happened to catch Sophia 's eye before it caught mine -- and its size , the elegance of the paper , the hand - writing altogether , immediately gave her a suspicion . Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire , and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was , and made her more jealous than ever . Affecting that air of playfulness , therefore , which is delightful in a woman one loves , she opened the letter directly , and read its contents . She was well paid for her impudence . She read what made her wretched . Her wretchedness I could have borne , but her passion -- her malice -- At all events it must be appeased . And , in short -- what do you think of my wife 's style of letter - writing?--delicate -- tender-- truly feminine -- was it not ? "
120849	120861	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand - writing . "
120862	121174	119449	119449	Elinor	91	" Yes , but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to . The original was all her own -- her own happy thoughts and gentle diction . But what could I do!--we were engaged , every thing in preparation , the day almost fixed -- But I am talking like a fool . Preparation!--day!--In honest words , her money was necessary to me , and in a situation like mine , any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture . And after all , what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends , in what language my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end . My business was to declare myself a scoundrel , and whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.-- ' I am ruined for ever in their opinion-- ' said I to myself--'I am shut out for ever from their society , they already think me an unprincipled fellow , this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one . ' Such were my reasonings , as , in a sort of desperate carelessness , I copied my wife 's words , and parted with the last relics of Marianne . Her three notes -- unluckily they were all in my pocketbook , or I should have denied their existence , and hoarded them for ever -- I was forced to put them up , and could not even kiss them . And the lock of hair -- that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket - book , which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear lock -- all , every memento was torn from me . "
121175	121187	121189	121189	Elinor	91	" You are very wrong , Mr. Willoughby , very blamable , "
121205	121297	121189	121189	Elinor	91	" you ought not to speak in this way , either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister . You had made your own choice . It was not forced on you . Your wife has a claim to your politeness , to your respect , at least . She must be attached to you , or she would not have married you . To treat her with unkindness , to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne -- nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience . "
121298	121308	121310	121310	he	2360	" Do not talk to me of my wife , "
121315	121407	121310	121310	he	2360	" She does not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no regard for her when we married.--Well , married we were , and came down to Combe Magna to be happy , and afterwards returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity me , Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?-- Am I -- be it only one degree -- am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before?--My intentions were not always wrong . Have I explained away any part of my guilt ? "
121408	121470	121189	121189	Elinor	91	" Yes , you have certainly removed something -- a little.-- You have proved yourself , on the whole , less faulty than I had believed you . You have proved your heart less wicked , much less wicked . But I hardly know -- the misery that you have inflicted -- I hardly know what could have made it worse . "
121471	121590	121310	121310	he	2360	" Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered , what I have been telling you?--Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours . You tell me that she has forgiven me already . Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart , and of my present feelings , will draw from her a more spontaneous , more natural , more gentle , less dignified , forgiveness . Tell her of my misery and my penitence -- tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her , and if you will , that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever . "
121591	121633	121189	121189	Elinor	91	" I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification . But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard of her illness . "
121634	121943	121310	121310	he	2360	" Last night , in Drury Lane lobby , I ran against Sir John Middleton , and when he saw who I was -- for the first time these two months -- he spoke to me.--That he had cut me ever since my marriage , I had seen without surprise or resentment . Now , however , his good - natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to -- though probably he did not think it WOULD -- vex me horridly . As bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland -- a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent -- the Palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c.--I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John . His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill - will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy . What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying -- and dying too , believing me the greatest villain upon earth , scorning , hating me in her latest moments -- for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed ? ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing-- What I felt was dreadful!--My resolution was soon made , and at eight o'clock this morning I was in my carriage . Now you know all . "
122201	122215	122178	122178	Willoughby	110	" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off . "
122216	122224	122178	122178	Willoughby	110	" Are you going back to town ? "
122225	122250	122178	122178	Willoughby	110	" No -- to Combe Magna . I have business there ; from thence to town in a day or two . Good bye . "
122270	122281	122282	122282	he	2361	" And you DO think something better of me than you did?"--said
122347	122352	122354	122354	he	2361	" As to that , "
122356	122445	122354	122354	he	2361	" I must rub through the world as well as I can . Domestic happiness is out of the question . If , however , I am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions , it may be the means -- it may put me on my guard -- at least , it may be something to live for . Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever . Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again-- "
122453	122454	122446	122446	Elinor	91	" Well,"--he
122455	122473	122446	122446	Elinor	91	replied--"once more good bye . I shall now go away and live in dread of one event . "
122474	122480	122446	122446	Elinor	91	" What do you mean ? "
122481	122487	122446	122446	Elinor	91	" Your sister 's marriage . "
122488	122507	122446	122446	Elinor	91	" You are very wrong . She can never be more lost to you than she is now . "
122508	122572	122446	122446	Elinor	91	" But she will be gained by some one else . And if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , I could least bear -- but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive . Good bye,--God bless you ! "
123325	123329	123323	123323	Willoughby	110	" poor Willoughby , "
123725	123756	123757	123757	Her	92	" At last we are alone . My Elinor , you do not yet know all my happiness . Colonel Brandon loves Marianne . He has told me so himself . "
123778	123844	123757	123757	Her	92	" You are never like me , dear Elinor , or I should wonder at your composure now . Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family , I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon 's marrying one of you as the object most desirable . And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two . "
123908	124030	123900	123900	she	347	" He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled . It came out quite unawares , quite undesignedly . I , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal his distress ; I saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy -- or rather , not thinking at all , I suppose -- giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for Marianne . He has loved her , my Elinor , ever since the first moment of seeing her . "
124069	124151	123900	123900	she	347	" His regard for her , infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned , as much more warm , as more sincere or constant -- which ever we are to call it-- has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne 's unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!--and without selfishness -- without encouraging a hope!--could he have seen her happy with another -- Such a noble mind!-- such openness , such sincerity!--no one can be deceived in HIM . "
124152	124158	124160	124160	Elinor	91	" Colonel Brandon 's character , "
124162	124172	124160	124160	Elinor	91	" as an excellent man , is well established . "
124173	124177	124178	124179	her mother	347	" I know it is"--replied
124182	124236	124178	124179	her mother	347	" or after such a warning , I should be the last to encourage such affection , or even to be pleased by it . But his coming for me as he did , with such active , such ready friendship , is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men . "
124237	124243	124245	124245	Elinor	91	" His character , however , "
124247	124366	124245	124245	Elinor	91	" does not rest on ONE act of kindness , to which his affection for Marianne , were humanity out of the case , would have prompted him . To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him?--Did you allow him to hope ? "
124367	124527	124721	124722	her mother	347	" Oh ! my love , I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself . Marianne might at that moment be dying . But he did not ask for hope or encouragement . His was an involuntary confidence , an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend -- not an application to a parent . Yet after a time I DID say , for at first I was quite overcome -- that if she lived , as I trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , I have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power . Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything;--Marianne 's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.-- His own merits must soon secure it . "
124528	124548	124245	124245	Elinor	91	" To judge from the Colonel 's spirits , however , you have not yet made him equally sanguine . "
124549	124715	124721	124722	her mother	347	" No.--He thinks Marianne 's affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time , and even supposing her heart again free , is too diffident of himself to believe , that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her . There , however , he is quite mistaken . His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed;--and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy . And his person , his manners too , are all in his favour . My partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby -- but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.-- There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby 's eyes at times , which I did not like . "
124732	124853	124854	124854	She	2409	" And his manners , the Colonel 's manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby 's ever were , but they are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching to Marianne . Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness -- often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other . I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be with Colonel Brandon . "
124877	124891	124893	124894	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" At Delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me , "
124896	124939	124893	124894	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation . "
124956	124996	124893	124894	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , I am sure it must be a good one . "
126193	126207	126209	126209	she	92	" When the weather is settled , and I have recovered my strength , "
126211	126432	126209	126209	she	92	" we will take long walks together every day . We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down , and see how the children go on ; we will walk to Sir John 's new plantations at Barton Cross , and the Abbeyland ; and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory , and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached . I know we shall be happy . I know the summer will pass happily away . I mean never to be later in rising than six , and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading . I have formed my plan , and am determined to enter on a course of serious study . Our own library is too well known to me , to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement . But there are many works well worth reading at the Park ; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon . By reading only six hours a - day , I shall gain in the course of a twelve - month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want . "
126709	126713	126705	126705	Marianne	92	" There , exactly there,"--pointing
126718	126733	126705	126705	Marianne	92	" on that projecting mound,--there I fell ; and there I first saw Willoughby . "
126747	126771	126744	126744	she	92	" I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject , Elinor?"--
126775	126795	126744	126744	she	92	said.--"Or will it be wrong?--I can talk of it now , I hope , as I ought to do . "--
126804	126809	126811	126811	Marianne	92	" As for regret , "
126813	126909	126811	126811	Marianne	92	" I have done with that , as far as HE is concerned . I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him , but what they are NOW.--At present , if I could be satisfied on one point , if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting a part , not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all , if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him , since the story of that unfortunate girl"--
126922	126938	126913	126913	Elinor	91	" If you could be assured of that , you think you should be easy . "
126939	126998	126913	126913	Elinor	91	" Yes . My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;-- for not only is it horrible to suspect a person , who has been what HE has been to ME , of such designs,--but what must it make me appear to myself?--What in a situation like mine , but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to"--
126999	127003	126913	126913	Elinor	91	" How then , "
127008	127016	126913	126913	Elinor	91	" would you account for his behaviour ? "
127017	127038	126913	126913	Elinor	91	" I would suppose him,--Oh , how gladly would I suppose him , only fickle , very , very fickle . "
127078	127088	127090	127090	Marianne	92	" I am not wishing him too much good , "
127097	127120	127090	127090	Marianne	92	" when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own . He will suffer enough in them . "
127121	127130	126913	126913	Elinor	91	" Do you compare your conduct with his ? "
127131	127151	127090	127090	Marianne	92	" No . I compare it with what it ought to have been ; I compare it with yours . "
127152	127160	126913	126913	Elinor	91	" Our situations have borne little resemblance . "
127161	127725	127090	127090	Marianne	92	" They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not , my dearest Elinor , let your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure . My illness has made me think-- It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection . Long before I was enough recovered to talk , I was perfectly able to reflect . I considered the past : I saw in my own behaviour , since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn , nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself , and want of kindness to others . I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings , and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave . My illness , I well knew , had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health , as I had felt even at the time to be wrong . Had I died,--it would have been self - destruction . I did not know my danger till the danger was removed ; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me , I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live , to have time for atonement to my God , and to you all , did not kill me at once . Had I died,-- in what peculiar misery should I have left you , my nurse , my friend , my sister!--You , who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days ; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too ! How could you have consoled her!--I can not express my own abhorrence of myself . Whenever I looked towards the past , I saw some duty neglected , or some failing indulged . Every body seemed injured by me . The kindness , the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings , I had repaid with ungrateful contempt . To the Middletons , to the Palmers , the Steeles , to every common acquaintance even , I had been insolent and unjust ; with a heart hardened against their merits , and a temper irritated by their very attention.--To John , to Fanny,--yes , even to them , little as they deserve , I had given less than their due . But you,--you above all , above my mother , had been wronged by me . I , and only I , knew your heart and its sorrows ; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was before me ; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate of you and your comfort ? Did I imitate your forbearance , or lessen your restraints , by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;-- not less when I knew you to be unhappy , than when I had believed you at ease , did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship ; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me , regretting only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me , and leaving you , for or I professed an unbounded affection , to be miserable for my sake . "
127775	127977	127768	127768	Marianne	92	" You are very good.--The future must be my proof . I have laid down my plan , and if I am capable of adhering to it -- my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved . They shall no longer worry others , nor torture myself . I shall now live solely for my family . You , my mother , and Margaret , must henceforth be all the world to me ; you will share my affections entirely between you . > From you , from my home , I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move ; and if I do mix in other society , it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled , my heart amended , and that I can practise the civilities , the lesser duties of life , with gentleness and forbearance . As for Willoughby -- to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him , would be idle . His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions . But it shall be regulated , it shall be checked by religion , by reason , by constant employment . "
127988	128002	127978	127978	She	2460	" If I could but know HIS heart , everything would become easy . "
128268	128272	128275	128275	her	2460	" Tell mama , "
128636	128644	128646	128646	she	92	" I wish to assure you both , "
128648	128663	128646	128646	she	92	" that I see every thing -- as you can desire me to do . "
128702	128729	128699	128699	Marianne	92	" It is a great relief to me -- what Elinor told me this morning -- I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear . "--For
128749	128803	128741	128741	she	92	before--"I am now perfectly satisfied , I wish for no change . I never could have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later I must have known , all this.--I should have had no confidence , no esteem . Nothing could have done it away to my feelings . "
128804	128813	128815	128816	her mother	347	" I know it -- I know it , "
128818	128880	128741	128741	she	92	" Happy with a man of libertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends , and the best of men!--No -- my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience , her sensitive conscience , would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt . "
128887	128894	128881	128881	Marianne	92	" I wish for no change . "
128895	128901	128903	128903	Elinor	91	" You consider the matter , "
128905	129198	128903	128903	Elinor	91	" exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it ; and I dare say you perceive , as well as myself , not only in this , but in many other circumstances , reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments , in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection , on his side , much less certain . Had you married , you must have been always poor . His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self - denial is a word hardly understood by him . His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before . YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you , I know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that-- and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge HIS enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ? "
129209	129212	129205	129205	she	92	" Selfish ? "
129217	129224	129205	129205	she	92	implied--"do you really think him selfish ? "
129225	129232	129234	129234	Elinor	91	" The whole of his behaviour , "
129236	129309	129234	129234	Elinor	91	" from the beginning to the end of the affair , has been grounded on selfishness . It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections ; which afterwards , when his own were engaged , made him delay the confession of it , and which finally carried him from Barton . His own enjoyment , or his own ease , was , in every particular , his ruling principle . "
129310	129323	129205	129205	she	92	" It is very true . MY happiness never was his object . "
129324	129328	129330	129330	Elinor	91	" At present , "
129332	129501	129330	129330	Elinor	91	" he regrets what he has done . And why does he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towards himself . It has not made him happy . His circumstances are now unembarrassed -- he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself . But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have been different . He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing . He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous -- always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife . "
129502	129511	129513	129513	Marianne	92	" I have not a doubt of it , "
129515	129529	129513	129513	Marianne	92	" and I have nothing to regret -- nothing but my own folly . "
129530	129541	129543	129544	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" Rather say your mother 's imprudence , my child , "
129546	129552	129543	129544	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" SHE must be answerable . "
129597	129654	129585	129585	she	91	" One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby 's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams . That crime has been the origin of every lesser one , and of all his present discontents . "
129884	129913	129876	129876	John	90	" We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward , and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject , but conclude him to be still at Oxford ; "
130001	130015	129980	129980	he	2487	" I suppose you know , ma'am , that Mr. Ferrars is married . "
130226	130238	130554	130555	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married , Thomas ? "
130239	130434	130179	130179	her	91	" I see Mr. Ferrars myself , ma'am , this morning in Exeter , and his lady too , Miss Steele as was . They was stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn , as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother , who is one of the post - boys . I happened to look up as I went by the chaise , and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele ; so I took off my hat , and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma'am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars 's , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they 'd make sure to come and see you . "
130435	130447	130554	130555	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" But did she tell you she was married , Thomas ? "
130448	130499	130179	130179	her	91	" Yes , ma'am . She smiled , and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts . She was always a very affable and free - spoken young lady , and very civil behaved . So , I made free to wish her joy . "
130500	130510	130554	130555	Mrs. Dashwood	90	" Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her ? "
130511	130539	130179	130179	her	91	" Yes , ma'am , I just see him leaning back in it , but he did not look up;--he never was a gentleman much for talking . "
130562	130572	130179	130179	her	91	" Was there no one else in the carriage ? "
130573	130582	130179	130179	her	91	" No , ma'am , only they two . "
130583	130592	130179	130179	her	91	" Do you know where they came from ? "
130593	130608	130179	130179	her	91	" They come straight from town , as Miss Lucy-- Mrs. Ferrars told me . "
130609	130617	130179	130179	her	91	" And are they going farther westward ? "
130618	130646	130179	130179	her	91	" Yes , ma'am -- but not to bide long . They will soon be back again , and then they 'd be sure and call here . "
130727	130739	130717	130717	Elinor	91	" Did you see them off , before you came away ? "
130740	130767	130721	130721	she	91	" No , ma'am -- the horses were just coming out , but I could not bide any longer ; I was afraid of being late . "
130768	130775	130717	130717	Elinor	91	" Did Mrs. Ferrars look well ? "
130776	130808	130721	130721	she	91	" Yes , ma'am , she said how she was very well ; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady -- and she seemed vastly contented . "
131563	131574	131584	131584	her	91	" When do you write to Colonel Brandon , ma'am ? "
131592	131643	131675	131678	a man on horseback	1009	" I wrote to him , my love , last week , and rather expect to see , than to hear from him again . I earnestly pressed his coming to us , and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow , or any day . "
131767	131791	131760	131760	She	91	" He comes from Mr. Pratt 's purposely to see us . I WILL be calm ; I WILL be mistress of myself . "
132224	132231	132210	132210	herself	91	" Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple ? "
132232	132236	132237	132237	he	1029	" At Longstaple ! "
132245	132254	132210	132210	herself	91	" No , my mother is in town . "
132255	132259	132261	132261	Elinor	91	" I meant , "
132271	132279	132261	132261	Elinor	91	" to inquire for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars . "
132312	132327	132296	132296	He	1029	" Perhaps you mean -- my brother -- you mean Mrs.--Mrs . ROBERT Ferrars . "
132328	132331	132334	132334	Marianne	92	" Mrs. Robert Ferrars!"--was
132419	132448	132449	132449	His	1029	" Perhaps you do not know -- you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to -- to the youngest -- to Miss Lucy Steele . "
132486	132489	132491	132491	he	1029	" Yes , "
132493	132506	132491	132491	he	1029	" they were married last week , and are now at Dawlish . "
133079	133091	133093	133093	he	1029	" It was a foolish , idle inclination on my side , "
133095	133466	133093	133093	he	1029	" the consequence of ignorance of the world-- and want of employment . Had my brother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr. Pratt , I think -- nay , I am sure , it would never have happened ; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought , at the time , a most unconquerable preference for his niece , yet had I then had any pursuit , any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months , I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment , especially by mixing more with the world , as in such case I must have done . But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen . I had therefore nothing in the world to do , but to fancy myself in love ; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable , as I had no friend , no companion in my brother , and disliked new acquaintance , it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple , where I always felt myself at home , and was always sure of a welcome ; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen : Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging . She was pretty too -- at least I thought so THEN ; and I had seen so little of other women , that I could make no comparisons , and see no defects . Considering everything , therefore , I hope , foolish as our engagement was , foolish as it has since in every way been proved , it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly . "
134125	134130	134119	134119	She	91	" THAT was exactly like Robert,"--was
134133	134136	134137	134137	he	145	observation.--"And THAT , "
134141	134179	134137	134137	he	145	" might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began . And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour . Other designs might afterward arise . "
134317	134320	134308	134308	He	145	" DEAR SIR ,
134321	134505	134308	134308	He	145	" Being very sure I have long lost your affections , I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another , and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you ; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another 's . Sincerely wish you happy in your choice , and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends , as our near relationship now makes proper . I can safely say I owe you no ill - will , and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices . Your brother has gained my affections entirely , and as we could not live without one another , we are just returned from the altar , and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks , which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see , but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines , and shall always remain ,
134506	134518	134308	134308	He	145	" Your sincere well - wisher , friend , and sister , "
134522	134558	134308	134308	He	145	" I have burnt all your letters , and will return your picture the first opportunity . Please to destroy my scrawls -- but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep . "
134568	134581	134308	134308	He	145	" I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition , "
134583	134663	134308	134308	He	145	Edward.--"For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU in former days.--In a sister it is bad enough , but in a wife!--how I have blushed over the pages of her writing!--and I believe I may say that since the first half year of our foolish -- business -- this is the only letter I ever received from her , of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style . "
134664	134672	134674	134674	Elinor	91	" However it may have come about , "
134678	134775	134308	134308	He	145	pause,--"they are certainly married . And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment . The independence she settled on Robert , through resentment against you , has put it in his power to make his own choice ; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a - year , to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do . She will hardly be less hurt , I suppose , by Robert 's marrying Lucy , than she would have been by your marrying her . "
134776	134809	134674	134674	Elinor	91	" She will be more hurt by it , for Robert always was her favourite.--She will be more hurt by it , and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner . "
135195	135202	135204	135204	he	2570	" I thought it my duty , "
135206	135368	135204	135204	he	2570	" independent of my feelings , to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not , when I was renounced by my mother , and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me . In such a situation as that , where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature , how could I suppose , when she so earnestly , so warmly insisted on sharing my fate , whatever it might be , that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement ? And even now , I can not comprehend on what motive she acted , or what fancied advantage it could be to her , to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard , and who had only two thousand pounds in the world . She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living . "
135369	135458	135490	135490	Elinor	91	" No ; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour ; that your own family might in time relent . And at any rate , she lost nothing by continuing the engagement , for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions . The connection was certainly a respectable one , and probably gained her consideration among her friends ; and , if nothing more advantageous occurred , it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single . "
135525	135533	135535	135535	she	91	" Your behaviour was certainly very wrong , "
135537	135572	135535	135535	she	91	" because -- to say nothing of my own conviction , our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT , as you were THEN situated , could never be . "
135595	135731	135732	135732	Elinor	91	" I was simple enough to think , that because my FAITH was plighted to another , there could be no danger in my being with you ; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour . I felt that I admired you , but I told myself it was only friendship ; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and Lucy , I did not know how far I was got . After that , I suppose , I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex , and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it , were no better than these:--The danger is my own ; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself . "
135786	135791	135793	135793	he	2581	Delaford--"Which , at present , "
135795	135819	135793	135793	he	2581	" after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion , he must think I have never forgiven him for offering . "
136572	136577	136578	136578	she	107	" I do think , "
136581	136791	136578	136578	she	107	" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again . And I must say that Lucy 's crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all . Poor Mr. Edward ! I can not get him out of my head , but you must send for him to Barton , and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him . "
136979	137110	136975	136975	He	87	" Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward 's name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a line has been received from him on the occasion . Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars 's heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children . "
137147	137154	137156	137156	he	2615	" A letter of proper submission ! "
137158	137219	137156	137156	he	2615	" would they have me beg my mother 's pardon for Robert 's ingratitude to HER , and breach of honour to ME?--I can make no submission -- I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy ; but that would not interest.--I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make . "
137220	137229	137231	137231	Elinor	91	" You may certainly ask to be forgiven , "
137233	137267	137231	137231	Elinor	91	" because you have offended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother 's anger . "
137274	137305	137306	137306	He	2615	" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first . "

But , I confess , it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother .
