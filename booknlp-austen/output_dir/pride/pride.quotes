86	92	94	95	his lady	214	“ My dear Mr. Bennet , ”
101	113	94	95	his lady	214	“ have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? ”
122	127	129	129	she	214	“ But it is , ”
131	148	129	129	she	214	“ for Mrs. Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . ”
155	167	169	170	his wife	215	“ Do not you want to know who has taken it ? ”
174	192	210	211	George Allen	76	“ _ You _ want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . ”
196	204	210	211	George Allen	76	“ He came down to see the place ”
221	309	210	211	George Allen	76	“ Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . ”
310	316	210	211	George Allen	76	“ What is his name ? ”
317	320	210	211	George Allen	76	“ Bingley . ”
321	328	210	211	George Allen	76	“ Is he married or single ? ”
329	363	210	211	George Allen	76	“ Oh , single , my dear , to be sure ! A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . What a fine thing for our girls ! ”
364	374	210	211	George Allen	76	“ How so ? how can it affect them ? ”
375	381	210	211	George Allen	76	“ My dear Mr. Bennet , ”
386	408	210	211	George Allen	76	“ how can you be so tiresome ? You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . ”
409	418	210	211	George Allen	76	“ Is that his design in settling here ? ”
419	460	210	211	George Allen	76	“ Design ? Nonsense , how can you talk so ! But it is very likely that he _ may _ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . ”
461	513	210	211	George Allen	76	“ I see no occasion for that . You and the girls may go -- or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better ; for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party . ”
514	565	210	211	George Allen	76	“ My dear , you flatter me . I certainly _ have _ had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now . When a woman has five grown - up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . ”
566	582	210	211	George Allen	76	“ In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . ”
583	604	210	211	George Allen	76	“ But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . ”
605	618	210	211	George Allen	76	“ It is more than I engage for , I assure you . ”
619	689	210	211	George Allen	76	“ But consider your daughters . Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account ; for in general , you know , they visit no new comers . Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _ us _ to visit him , if you do not . ”
690	750	210	211	George Allen	76	“ You are over scrupulous , surely . I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls -- though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . ”
751	804	210	211	George Allen	76	“ I desire you will do no such thing . Lizzy is not a bit better than the others : and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good - humoured as Lydia . But you are always giving _ her _ the preference . ”
805	816	818	818	he	218	“ They have none of them much to recommend them , ”
820	842	818	818	he	218	“ they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . ”
843	875	210	211	George Allen	76	“ Mr. Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? You take delight in vexing me . You have no compassion on my poor nerves . ”
876	913	818	818	he	218	“ You mistake me , my dear . I have a high respect for your nerves . They are my old friends . I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . ”
914	925	210	211	George Allen	76	“ Ah , you do not know what I suffer . ”
926	953	818	818	he	218	“ But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . ”
954	976	210	211	George Allen	76	“ It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them . ”
977	997	818	818	he	218	“ Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . ”
1117	1125	1131	1132	George Allen	76	“ I hope Mr. Bingley will like it ”
1216	1227	1211	1211	he	74	“ I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . ”
1228	1244	1246	1247	her mother	225	“ We are not in a way to know _ what _ Mr. Bingley likes , ”
1251	1259	1246	1247	her mother	225	“ since we are not to visit . ”
1260	1267	1269	1269	Elizabeth	82	“ But you forget , mamma , ”
1271	1291	1269	1269	Elizabeth	82	“ that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him . ”
1292	1329	1359	1360	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . She has two nieces of her own . She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . ”
1330	1336	1338	1339	Mr. Bennet	74	“ No more have I , ”
1341	1358	1338	1339	Mr. Bennet	74	“ and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . ”
1382	1410	1359	1360	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Do n’t keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven ’s sake ! Have a little compassion on my nerves . You tear them to pieces . ”
1411	1420	1422	1423	her father	228	“ Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , ”
1425	1431	1422	1423	her father	228	“ she times them ill . ”
1432	1442	1444	1444	Kitty	86	“ I do not cough for my own amusement , ”
1448	1459	1444	1444	Kitty	86	“ When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? ”
1460	1466	1359	1360	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ To - morrow fortnight . ”
1467	1474	1476	1477	her mother	225	“ Ay , so it is , ”
1479	1512	1476	1477	her mother	225	“ and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . ”
1513	1537	1359	1360	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _ her _ . ”
1538	1562	1476	1477	her mother	225	“ Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? ”
1563	1648	1359	1360	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ I honour your circumspection . A fortnight ’s acquaintance is certainly very little . One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . But if _ we _ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . ”
1661	1666	1656	1657	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Nonsense , nonsense ! ”
1667	1678	1680	1680	he	231	“ What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? ”
1682	1742	1680	1680	he	231	“ Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? I can not quite agree with you _ there _ . What say you , Mary ? For you are a young lady of deep reflection , I know , and read great books , and make extracts . ”
1756	1764	1765	1765	he	231	“ While Mary is adjusting her ideas , ”
1768	1776	1765	1765	he	231	“ let us return to Mr. Bingley . ”
1777	1785	1787	1788	his wife	215	“ I am sick of Mr. Bingley , ”
1790	1850	1787	1788	his wife	215	“ I am sorry to hear _ that _ ; but why did you not tell me so before ? If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . ”
1896	1969	1881	1881	she	85	“ How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet ! But I knew I should persuade you at last . I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . Well , how pleased I am ! And it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . ”
1970	1984	1986	1987	Mr. Bennet	74	“ Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , ”
2008	2018	2020	2020	she	215	“ What an excellent father you have , girls , ”
2028	2113	2020	2020	she	215	“ I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . At our time of life , it is not so pleasant , I can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes we would do anything . Lydia , my love , though you _ are _ the youngest , I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . ”
2114	2117	2119	2119	Lydia	83	“ Oh , ”
2123	2143	2119	2119	Lydia	83	“ I am not afraid ; for though I _ am _ the youngest , I ’m the tallest . ”
2176	2182	2119	2119	Lydia	83	“ He rode a black horse ”
2347	2362	2364	2365	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , ”
2370	2387	2364	2365	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . ”
2603	2608	2599	2599	his	79	“ When the Party entered ”
3158	3163	3165	3165	he	89	“ Come , Darcy , ”
3167	3194	3165	3165	he	89	“ I must have you dance . I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . You had much better dance . ”
3195	3257	3271	3271	Bingley	79	“ I certainly shall not . You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . ”
3258	3269	3271	3271	Bingley	79	“ I would not be so fastidious as you are , ”
3273	3312	3271	3271	Bingley	79	“ for a kingdom ! Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening ; and there are several of them , you see , uncommonly pretty . ”
3313	3328	3330	3331	Mr. Darcy	89	“ _ You _ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , ”
3340	3388	3271	3271	Bingley	79	“ Oh , she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say very agreeable . Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . ”
3392	3396	3419	3419	he	89	“ She is tolerable ”
3408	3414	3419	3419	he	89	“ Which do you mean ? ”
3442	3499	3433	3433	he	89	“ She is tolerable : but not handsome enough to tempt _ me _ ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . ”
3764	3772	3774	3774	she	215	“ Oh , my dear Mr. Bennet , ”
3779	3978	3774	3774	she	215	“ we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . I wish you had been there . Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . Everybody said how well she looked ; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . Only think of _ that _ , my dear : he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . So he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the _ Boulanger_---- ”
3979	3991	3993	3994	her husband	239	“ If he had had any compassion for _ me _ , ”
3997	4031	3993	3994	her husband	239	“ he would not have danced half so much ! For God ’s sake , say no more of his partners . O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! ”
4032	4038	4040	4041	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Oh , my dear , ”
4043	4087	4040	4041	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ I am quite delighted with him . He is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women . I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses . I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst ’s gown---- ”
4135	4142	4143	4143	she	85	“ But I can assure you , ”
4146	4239	4143	4143	she	85	“ that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _ his _ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . So high and so conceited , that there was no enduring him ! He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! Not handsome enough to dance with ! I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set - downs . I quite detest the man . ”
4276	4289	4291	4291	she	119	“ He is just what a young - man ought to be , ”
4293	4320	4291	4291	she	119	“ sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! ”
4321	4327	4329	4329	Elizabeth	82	“ He is also handsome , ”
4331	4351	4329	4329	Elizabeth	82	“ which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can . His character is thereby complete . ”
4352	4376	4291	4291	she	119	“ I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . I did not expect such a compliment . ”
4377	4478	4329	4329	Elizabeth	82	“ Did not you ? _ I _ did for you . But that is one great difference between us . Compliments always take _ you _ by surprise , and _ me _ never . What could be more natural than his asking you again ? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . No thanks to his gallantry for that . Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . You have liked many a stupider person . ”
4479	4483	4291	4291	she	119	“ Dear Lizzy ! ”
4484	4537	4329	4329	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh , you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . You never see a fault in anybody . All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . ”
4538	4558	4291	4291	she	119	“ I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone ; but I always speak what I think . ”
4559	4663	4329	4329	Elizabeth	82	“ I know you do : and it is _ that _ which makes the wonder . With _ your _ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! Affectation of candour is common enough ; one meets with it everywhere . But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the good of everybody ’s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad,--belongs to you alone . And so , you like this man ’s sisters , too , do you ? Their manners are not equal to his . ”
4664	4714	4291	4291	she	119	“ Certainly not , at first ; but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . Miss Bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . ”
5769	5780	5782	5783	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ _ You _ began the evening well , Charlotte , ”
5795	5806	5782	5783	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ _ You _ were Mr. Bingley ’s first choice . ”
5807	5819	5782	5783	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . ”
5820	5875	5782	5783	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Oh , you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced with her twice . To be sure that _ did _ seem as if he admired her -- indeed , I rather believe he _ did_--I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson . ”
5876	5967	5782	5783	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson : did not I mention it to you ? Mr. Robinson ’s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _ which _ he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question , ‘ Oh , the eldest Miss Bennet , beyond a doubt : there can not be two opinions on that point . ’ ”
5968	6002	5782	5783	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided , indeed -- that does seem as if -- but , however , it may all come to nothing , you know . ”
6003	6020	6022	6022	Charlotte	101	“ _ My _ overhearings were more to the purpose than _ yours _ , Eliza , ”
6024	6052	6022	6022	Charlotte	101	“ Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just _ tolerable _ . ”
6053	6116	5782	5783	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ I beg you will not put it into Lizzy ’s head to be vexed by his ill - treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . ”
6120	6126	5782	5783	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Without once opening his lips ”
6138	6153	6155	6155	Jane	119	“ Are you quite sure , ma’am ? Is not there a little mistake ? ”
6157	6167	6155	6155	Jane	119	“ I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . ”
6168	6202	5782	5783	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Ay , because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . ”
6203	6209	6211	6211	Jane	119	“ Miss Bingley told me , ”
6213	6234	6211	6211	Jane	119	“ that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . With _ them _ he is remarkably agreeable . ”
6235	6311	5782	5783	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ I do not believe a word of it , my dear . If he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to Mrs. Long . But I can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise . ”
6312	6324	6326	6327	Miss Lucas	93	“ I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long , ”
6329	6339	6326	6327	Miss Lucas	93	“ but I wish he had danced with Eliza . ”
6340	6346	6348	6349	her mother	225	“ Another time , Lizzy , ”
6351	6366	6348	6349	her mother	225	“ I would not dance with _ him _ , if I were you . ”
6367	6386	5782	5783	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ I believe , ma’am , I may safely promise you _ never _ to dance with him . ”
6387	6391	6393	6394	Miss Lucas	93	“ His pride , ”
6396	6463	6393	6394	Miss Lucas	93	“ does not offend _ me _ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . One can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , everything in his favour , should think highly of himself . If I may so express it , he has a _ right _ to be proud . ”
6464	6470	6472	6472	Elizabeth	82	“ That is very true , ”
6474	6494	6472	6472	Elizabeth	82	“ and I could easily forgive _ his _ pride , if he had not mortified _ mine _ . ”
6495	6498	6500	6500	Mary	87	“ Pride , ”
6512	6624	6500	6500	Mary	87	“ is a very common failing , I believe . By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonymously . A person may be proud without being vain . Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves ; vanity to what we would have others think of us . ”
6625	6635	6637	6639	a young Lucas	370	“ If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy , ”
6647	6674	6637	6639	a young Lucas	370	“ I should not care how proud I was . I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . ”
6675	6688	6690	6691	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , ”
6693	6712	6690	6691	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ and if I were to see you at it , I should take away your bottle directly . ”
6996	7005	7007	7007	Charlotte	101	“ It may , perhaps , be pleasant , ”
7009	7179	7007	7007	Charlotte	101	“ to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . We can all _ begin _ freely -- a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better show _ more _ affection than she feels . Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . ”
7180	7219	6986	6986	She	119	“ But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . If _ I _ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . ”
7220	7237	7007	7007	Charlotte	101	“ Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ’s disposition as you do . ”
7238	7263	6986	6986	She	119	“ But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavor to conceal it , he must find it out . ”
7264	7357	7007	7007	Charlotte	101	“ Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . ”
7358	7366	7368	7368	Elizabeth	82	“ Your plan is a good one , ”
7370	7493	7368	7368	Elizabeth	82	“ where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . But these are not Jane ’s feelings ; she is not acting by design . As yet she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness . She has known him only a fortnight . She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . ”
7494	7544	7007	7007	Charlotte	101	“ Not as you represent it . Had she merely _ dined _ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal . ”
7545	7586	7368	7368	Elizabeth	82	“ Yes : these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce , but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . ”
7587	7590	7592	7592	Charlotte	101	“ Well , ”
7594	7720	7592	7592	Charlotte	101	“ I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar beforehand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . ”
7721	7753	7787	7788	Mr. Darcy	89	“ You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . ”
8015	8022	8024	8024	she	82	“ What does Mr. Darcy mean , ”
8028	8038	8024	8024	she	82	“ by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? ”
8039	8051	7993	7993	His	89	“ That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer . ”
8052	8101	8024	8024	she	82	“ But if he does it any more , I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . ”
8105	8110	8024	8024	she	82	“ The entreaties of several ”
8166	8198	8160	8160	she	93	“ Did not you think , Mr. Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? ”
8199	8216	8160	8160	she	93	“ With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . ”
8217	8224	8160	8160	she	93	“ You are severe on us . ”
8225	8238	8240	8241	Miss Lucas	93	“ It will be _ her _ turn soon to be teased , ”
8243	8260	8160	8160	she	93	“ I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . ”
8261	8326	8335	8335	she	93	“ You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody ! If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable ; but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . ”
8338	8351	8335	8335	she	93	“ Very well ; if it must be so , it must . ”
8359	8391	8335	8335	she	93	“ There is a very fine old saying , which everybody here is of course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and I shall keep mine to swell my song . ”
8632	8668	8699	8700	Sir William	80	“ What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr. Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing , after all . I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . ”
8669	8698	8699	8700	Sir William	80	“ Certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world : every savage can dance . ”
8704	8710	8711	8711	he	80	“ Your friend performs delightfully , ”
8725	8743	8711	8711	he	80	“ and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr. Darcy . ”
8744	8757	8699	8700	Sir William	80	“ You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , sir . ”
8758	8781	8711	8711	he	80	“ Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . Do you often dance at St. James ’s ? ”
8782	8787	8699	8700	Sir William	80	“ Never , sir . ”
8788	8803	8711	8711	he	80	“ Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? ”
8804	8822	8699	8700	Sir William	80	“ It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . ”
8823	8834	8711	8711	he	80	“ You have a house in town , I conclude ? ”
8839	8877	8878	8878	He	89	“ I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself , for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . ”
8923	8974	8981	8981	he	89	“ My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr. Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You can not refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . ”
9017	9050	9015	9016	Sir William,--	80	“ Indeed , sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . ”
9091	9144	9015	9016	Sir William,--	80	“ You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . ”
9145	9152	9154	9154	Elizabeth	82	“ Mr. Darcy is all politeness , ”
9158	9191	9015	9016	Sir William,--	80	“ He is , indeed : but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we can not wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? ”
9226	9236	9015	9016	Sir William,--	80	“ I can guess the subject of your reverie . ”
9237	9243	9015	9016	Sir William,--	80	“ I should imagine not . ”
9244	9314	9015	9016	Sir William,--	80	“ You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner,--in such society ; and , indeed , I am quite of your opinion . I was never more annoyed ! The insipidity , and yet the noise -- the nothingness , and yet the self - importance , of all these people ! What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! ”
9315	9358	9015	9016	Sir William,--	80	“ Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . My mind was more agreeably engaged . I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . ”
9392	9397	9015	9016	Sir William,--	80	“ Miss Elizabeth Bennet . ”
9398	9403	9405	9406	Miss Bingley	91	“ Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! ”
9408	9433	9405	9406	Miss Bingley	91	“ I am all astonishment . How long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am I to wish you joy ? ”
9434	9480	9015	9016	Sir William,--	80	“ That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . A lady ’s imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony , in a moment . I knew you would be wishing me joy . ”
9481	9526	9405	9406	Miss Bingley	91	“ Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . ”
9564	9570	9576	9577	George Allen	76	“ A note for Miss Bennet ”
9989	10027	9985	9986	Mr. Bennet	74	“ From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country . I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . ”
10076	10084	10086	10087	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ I am astonished , my dear , ”
10089	10124	10086	10087	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . If I wished to think slightingly of anybody ’s children , it should not be of my own , however . ”
10125	10142	10047	10047	her	83	“ If my children are silly , I must hope to be always sensible of it . ”
10143	10159	10086	10087	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Yes ; but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . ”
10160	10207	10047	10047	her	83	“ This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . ”
10208	10327	10086	10087	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ My dear Mr. Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age , I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and , indeed , so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ’s in his regimentals . ”
10328	10331	10333	10333	Lydia	83	“ Mamma , ”
10335	10374	10333	10333	Lydia	83	“ my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson ’s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke ’s library . ”
10425	10461	10415	10415	she	85	“ Well , Jane , who is it from ? What is it about ? What does he say ? Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . ”
10462	10469	10471	10471	Jane	119	“ It is from Miss Bingley , ”
10482	10488	10415	10415	she	85	“ My dear friend , * /
10489	10571	10415	10415	she	85	“ If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives ; for a whole day ’s _ tête - à - tête _ between two women can never end without a quarrel . Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . Yours ever ,
10572	10576	10415	10415	she	85	“ CAROLINE BINGLEY . ”
10577	10582	10584	10584	Lydia	83	“ With the officers ! ”
10586	10600	10584	10584	Lydia	83	“ I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _ that _ . ”
10601	10605	10607	10608	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Dining out , ”
10610	10616	10607	10608	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ that is very unlucky . ”
10617	10624	10626	10626	Jane	119	“ Can I have the carriage ? ”
10628	10656	10415	10415	she	85	“ No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . ”
10657	10665	10667	10667	Elizabeth	82	“ That would be a good scheme , ”
10669	10684	10667	10667	Elizabeth	82	“ if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . ”
10685	10711	10415	10415	she	85	“ Oh , but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley ’s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . ”
10712	10722	10667	10667	Elizabeth	82	“ I had much rather go in the coach . ”
10723	10755	10415	10415	she	85	“ But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure . They are wanted in the farm , Mr. Bennet , are not they ? ”
10756	10771	10667	10667	Elizabeth	82	“ They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . ”
10772	10783	10785	10785	Elizabeth	82	“ But if you have got them to - day , ”
10787	10796	10785	10785	Elizabeth	82	“ my mother ’s purpose will be answered . ”
10884	10895	10897	10898	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! ”
10954	10960	10941	10944	a servant from Netherfield	451	“ My dearest Lizzie , * /
10961	11044	10953	10953	NIND	117	“ I find myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and , excepting a sore throat and a headache , there is not much the matter with me .
11045	11050	10941	10944	a servant from Netherfield	451	“ Yours , etc . ”
11051	11057	11059	11060	Mr. Bennet	74	“ Well , my dear , ”
11070	11109	11059	11060	Mr. Bennet	74	“ if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness -- if she should die -- it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley , and under your orders . ”
11110	11166	11167	11167	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh , I am not at all afraid of her dying . People do not die of little trifling colds . She will be taken good care of . As long as she stays there , it is all very well . I would go and see her if I could have the carriage . ”
11206	11214	11216	11217	her mother	225	“ How can you be so silly , ”
11219	11246	11201	11201	She	82	“ as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . ”
11247	11263	11216	11217	her mother	225	“ I shall be very fit to see Jane -- which is all I want . ”
11264	11274	11276	11277	her father	228	“ Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , ”
11279	11286	11276	11277	her father	228	“ to send for the horses ? ”
11287	11323	11216	11217	her mother	225	“ No , indeed . I do not wish to avoid the walk . The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . I shall be back by dinner . ”
11324	11333	11335	11335	Mary	87	“ I admire the activity of your benevolence , ”
11337	11366	11335	11335	Mary	87	“ but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . ”
11367	11378	11380	11380	Catherine	86	“ We will go as far as Meryton with you , ”
11398	11404	11406	11406	Lydia	83	“ If we make haste , ”
11413	11427	11406	11406	Lydia	83	“ perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter , before he goes . ”
12013	12017	11987	11988	a servant	480	“ The Apothecary came ”
12022	12026	11987	11988	a servant	480	“ covering a screen ”
12358	12391	12350	12351	Mrs. Hurst	90	“ She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . I shall never forget her appearance this morning . She really looked almost wild . ”
12392	12439	12350	12351	Mrs. Hurst	90	“ She did indeed , Louisa . I could hardly keep my countenance . Very nonsensical to come at all ! Why must _ she _ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? Her hair so untidy , so blowzy ! ”
12440	12481	12350	12351	Mrs. Hurst	90	“ Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain , and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office . ”
12482	12492	12494	12494	Bingley	91	“ Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , ”
12496	12530	12494	12494	Bingley	91	“ but this was all lost upon me . I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning . Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . ”
12531	12545	12547	12548	Miss Bingley	91	“ _ You _ observed it , Mr. Darcy , I am sure , ”
12550	12573	12547	12548	Miss Bingley	91	“ and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _ your sister _ make such an exhibition . ”
12574	12578	12494	12494	Bingley	91	“ Certainly not . ”
12579	12639	12547	12548	Miss Bingley	91	“ To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! what could she mean by it ? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country - town indifference to decorum . ”
12640	12653	12655	12655	Bingley	91	“ It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , ”
12657	12665	12667	12668	Miss Bingley	91	“ I am afraid , Mr. Darcy , ”
12675	12689	12667	12668	Miss Bingley	91	“ that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . ”
12690	12695	12696	12696	he	492	“ Not at all , ”
12699	12707	12696	12696	he	492	“ they were brightened by the exercise . ”
12720	12769	12667	12668	Miss Bingley	91	“ I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . ”
12770	12787	12667	12668	Miss Bingley	91	“ I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton ? ”
12788	12802	12667	12668	Miss Bingley	91	“ Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . ”
12803	12808	12810	12811	her sister	308	“ That is capital , ”
12819	12832	12834	12834	Bingley	91	“ If they had uncles enough to fill _ all _ Cheapside , ”
12836	12847	12834	12834	Bingley	91	“ it would not make them one jot less agreeable . ”
12848	12867	12869	12869	Darcy	89	“ But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , ”
13053	13061	13063	13063	he	88	“ Do you prefer reading to cards ? ”
13065	13071	13063	13063	he	88	“ that is rather singular . ”
13072	13077	13079	13080	Miss Bingley	91	“ Miss Eliza Bennet , ”
13082	13100	13079	13080	Miss Bingley	91	“ despises cards . She is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else . ”
13101	13111	13113	13113	Elizabeth	82	“ I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , ”
13115	13133	13113	13113	Elizabeth	82	“ I am _ not _ a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . ”
13134	13146	13148	13148	Bingley	91	“ In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , ”
13150	13165	13148	13148	Bingley	91	“ and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . ”
13200	13239	13242	13242	him	88	“ And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow ; and though I have not many , I have more than I ever looked into . ”
13255	13260	13262	13263	Miss Bingley	91	“ I am astonished , ”
13265	13291	13262	13263	Miss Bingley	91	“ that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr. Darcy ! ”
13292	13299	13300	13300	he	88	“ It ought to be good , ”
13303	13313	13300	13300	he	88	“ it has been the work of many generations . ”
13314	13332	13262	13263	Miss Bingley	91	“ And then you have added so much to it yourself -- you are always buying books . ”
13333	13350	13300	13300	he	88	“ I can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . ”
13351	13392	13262	13263	Miss Bingley	91	“ Neglect ! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . Charles , when you build _ your _ house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . ”
13393	13399	13300	13300	he	88	“ I wish it may . ”
13400	13435	13262	13263	Miss Bingley	91	“ But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . ”
13436	13454	13300	13300	he	88	“ With all my heart : I will buy Pemberley itself , if Darcy will sell it . ”
13455	13464	13262	13263	Miss Bingley	91	“ I am talking of possibilities , Charles . ”
13465	13487	13300	13300	he	88	“ Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation . ”
13540	13550	13552	13553	Miss Bingley	91	“ Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? ”
13555	13565	13552	13553	Miss Bingley	91	“ will she be as tall as I am ? ”
13566	13586	13552	13553	Miss Bingley	91	“ I think she will . She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ’s height , or rather taller . ”
13587	13630	13552	13553	Miss Bingley	91	“ How I long to see her again ! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . Such a countenance , such manners , and so extremely accomplished for her age ! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite . ”
13631	13638	13640	13640	Bingley	79	“ It is amazing to me , ”
13642	13659	13640	13640	Bingley	79	“ how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are . ”
13660	13675	13552	13553	Miss Bingley	91	“ All young ladies accomplished ! My dear Charles , what do you mean ? ”
13676	13736	13640	13640	Bingley	79	“ Yes , all of them , I think . They all paint tables , cover screens , and net purses . I scarcely know any one who can not do all this ; and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . ”
13737	13747	13749	13749	Darcy	122	“ Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , ”
13751	13822	13749	13749	Darcy	122	“ has too much truth . The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen ; but I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . I can not boast of knowing more than half - a - dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished . ”
13823	13831	13833	13834	Miss Bingley	91	“ Nor I , I am sure , ”
13836	13839	13841	13841	Elizabeth	82	“ Then , ”
13843	13858	13841	13841	Elizabeth	82	“ you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . ”
13859	13871	13749	13749	Darcy	122	“ Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . ”
13872	13877	13879	13881	his faithful assistant	508	“ Oh , certainly , ”
13883	13968	13879	13881	his faithful assistant	508	“ no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with . A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and , besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . ”
13969	13976	13978	13978	Darcy	122	“ All this she must possess , ”
13980	14001	13978	13978	Darcy	122	“ and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . ”
14002	14029	13879	13881	his faithful assistant	508	“ I am no longer surprised at your knowing _ only _ six accomplished women . I rather wonder now at your knowing _ any _ . ”
14030	14048	13978	13978	Darcy	122	“ Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this ? ”
14049	14082	13879	13881	his faithful assistant	508	“ _ I _ never saw such a woman . _ I _ never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . ”
14149	14153	14155	14156	Miss Bingley	91	“ Eliza Bennet , ”
14166	14215	14155	14156	Miss Bingley	91	“ is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , I daresay , it succeeds ; but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . ”
14216	14219	14221	14221	Darcy	122	“ Undoubtedly , ”
14231	14258	14221	14221	Darcy	122	“ there is meanness in _ all _ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . ”
14717	14724	14726	14726	her	85	“ Indeed I have , sir , ”
14729	14762	14726	14726	her	85	“ She is a great deal too ill to be moved . Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her . We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . ”
14763	14766	14768	14768	Bingley	91	“ Removed ! ”
14770	14792	14768	14768	Bingley	91	“ It must not be thought of . My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . ”
14793	14802	14804	14805	Miss Bingley	91	“ You may depend upon it , madam , ”
14811	14826	14804	14805	Miss Bingley	91	“ that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . ”
14835	14840	14841	14841	she	85	“ I am sure , ”
14844	14979	14841	14841	she	85	“ if it was not for such good friends , I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I ever met with . I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _ her _ . You have a sweet room here , Mr. Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . You will not think of quitting it in a hurry , I hope , though you have but a short lease . ”
14980	14990	14992	14992	he	537	“ Whatever I do is done in a hurry , ”
14994	15027	14992	14992	he	537	“ and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . ”
15028	15040	15042	15042	Elizabeth	82	“ That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , ”
15044	15054	15056	15056	he	537	“ You begin to comprehend me , do you ? ”
15062	15071	14992	14992	he	537	“ Oh yes -- I understand you perfectly . ”
15072	15098	14992	14992	he	537	“ I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through , I am afraid , is pitiful . ”
15099	15129	14992	14992	he	537	“ That is as it happens . It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . ”
15130	15133	14992	14992	he	537	“ Lizzy , ”
15138	15162	14992	14992	he	537	“ remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . ”
15163	15170	15172	15172	Bingley	79	“ I did not know before , ”
15176	15192	15172	15172	Bingley	79	“ that you were a studier of character . It must be an amusing study . ”
15193	15213	14992	14992	he	537	“ Yes ; but intricate characters are the _ most _ amusing . They have at least that advantage . ”
15214	15218	15220	15220	Darcy	122	“ The country , ”
15222	15249	15220	15220	Darcy	122	“ can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . ”
15250	15271	14992	14992	he	537	“ But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . ”
15272	15277	15279	15280	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Yes , indeed , ”
15292	15314	15279	15280	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ I assure you there is quite as much of _ that _ going on in the country as in town . ”
15351	15392	15349	15349	her	85	“ I can not see that London has any great advantage over the country , for my part , except the shops and public places . The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr. Bingley ? ”
15393	15401	15402	15402	he	79	“ When I am in the country , ”
15405	15442	15402	15402	he	79	“ I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town , it is pretty much the same . They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . ”
15443	15459	15349	15349	her	85	“ Ay , that is because you have the right disposition . But that gentleman , ”
15464	15475	15349	15349	her	85	“ seemed to think the country was nothing at all . ”
15476	15485	15487	15487	Elizabeth	82	“ Indeed , mamma , you are mistaken , ”
15494	15532	15487	15487	Elizabeth	82	“ You quite mistook Mr. Darcy . He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . ”
15533	15576	15598	15598	her	542	“ Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger . I know we dine with four - and - twenty families . ”
15642	15717	15598	15598	her	542	“ Yes , she called yesterday with her father . What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr. Bingley -- is not he ? so much the man of fashion ! so genteel and so easy ! He has always something to say to everybody . _ That _ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter . ”
15718	15725	15598	15598	her	542	“ Did Charlotte dine with you ? ”
15726	15827	15598	15598	her	542	“ No , she would go home . I fancy she was wanted about the mince - pies . For my part , Mr. Bingley , _ I _ always keep servants that can do their own work ; _ my _ daughters are brought up differently . But everybody is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls , I assure you . It is a pity they are not handsome ! Not that _ I _ think Charlotte so _ very _ plain ; but then she is our particular friend . ”
15828	15837	15839	15839	Bingley	79	“ She seems a very pleasant young woman , ”
15841	15985	15598	15598	her	542	“ Oh dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane ’s beauty . I do not like to boast of my own child ; but to be sure , Jane -- one does not often see anybody better looking . It is what everybody says . I do not trust my own partiality . When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner ’s in town so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . But , however , he did not . Perhaps he thought her too young . However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were . ”
15986	15993	15995	15995	Elizabeth	82	“ And so ended his affection , ”
15999	16030	15995	15995	Elizabeth	82	“ There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! ”
16031	16047	16049	16049	Darcy	89	“ I have been used to consider poetry as the _ food _ of love , ”
16051	16096	15995	15995	Elizabeth	82	“ Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . Everything nourishes what is strong already . But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . ”
16412	16463	16398	16398	His	79	“ I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and , when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball . But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill ? ”
16469	16511	16512	16512	she	83	“ Oh yes -- it would be much better to wait till Jane was well ; and by that time , most likely , Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . And when you have given _ your _ ball , ”
16515	16541	16512	16512	she	83	“ I shall insist on their giving one also . I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . ”
16803	16816	16817	16817	He	89	“ How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! ”
16822	16828	16965	16965	He	568	“ You write uncommonly fast . ”
16829	16839	16965	16965	He	568	“ You are mistaken . I write rather slowly . ”
16840	16870	16965	16965	He	568	“ How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year ! Letters of business , too ! How odious I should think them ! ”
16871	16889	16965	16965	He	568	“ It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . ”
16890	16902	16965	16965	He	568	“ Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . ”
16903	16916	16965	16965	He	568	“ I have already told her so once , by your desire . ”
16917	16941	16965	16965	He	568	“ I am afraid you do not like your pen . Let me mend it for you . I mend pens remarkably well . ”
16942	16953	16965	16965	He	568	“ Thank you -- but I always mend my own . ”
16954	16964	16965	16965	He	568	“ How can you contrive to write so even ? ”
16969	17016	16965	16965	He	568	“ Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley ’s . ”
17017	17043	16965	16965	He	568	“ Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . ”
17044	17075	16965	16965	He	568	“ Oh , it is of no consequence . I shall see her in January . But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr. Darcy ? ”
17076	17095	16965	16965	He	568	“ They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . ”
17096	17120	16965	16965	He	568	“ It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter with ease can not write ill . ”
17121	17134	16965	16965	He	568	“ That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , ”
17139	17166	16965	16965	He	568	“ because he does _ not _ write with ease . He studies too much for words of four syllables . Do not you , Darcy ? ”
17167	17178	16965	16965	He	568	“ My style of writing is very different from yours . ”
17179	17182	17184	17185	Miss Bingley	91	“ Oh , ”
17187	17209	17184	17185	Miss Bingley	91	“ Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable . He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . ”
17210	17240	16965	16965	He	568	“ My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them ; by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . ”
17241	17248	17250	17250	Elizabeth	82	“ Your humility , Mr. Bingley , ”
17252	17257	17250	17250	Elizabeth	82	“ must disarm reproof . ”
17258	17264	17266	17266	Darcy	89	“ Nothing is more deceitful , ”
17268	17289	17266	17266	Darcy	89	“ than the appearance of humility . It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . ”
17290	17308	16965	16965	He	568	“ And which of the two do you call _ my _ little recent piece of modesty ? ”
17309	17452	17266	17266	Darcy	89	“ The indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which , if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . The power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance . When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning , that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself ; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else ? ”
17453	17456	17458	17458	Bingley	79	“ Nay , ”
17460	17529	17266	17266	Darcy	89	“ this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies . ”
17530	17621	17266	17266	Darcy	89	“ I daresay you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , ‘ Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ’ you would probably do it -- you would probably not go -- and , at another word , might stay a month . ”
17622	17630	17632	17632	Elizabeth	82	“ You have only proved by this , ”
17634	17660	17632	17632	Elizabeth	82	“ that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . You have shown him off now much more than he did himself . ”
17661	17667	17669	17669	Bingley	79	“ I am exceedingly gratified , ”
17671	17741	17669	17669	Bingley	79	“ by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me if , under such a circumstance , I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could . ”
17742	17765	17266	17266	Darcy	89	“ Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? ”
17766	17785	17266	17266	Darcy	89	“ Upon my word , I can not exactly explain the matter -- Darcy must speak for himself . ”
17786	17866	17266	17266	Darcy	89	“ You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . ”
17867	17888	17266	17266	Darcy	89	“ To yield readily -- easily -- to the _ persuasion _ of a friend is no merit with you . ”
17889	17903	17266	17266	Darcy	89	“ To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . ”
17904	18041	17266	17266	Darcy	89	“ You appear to me , Mr. Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley . We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . But in general and ordinary cases , between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? ”
18042	18086	17266	17266	Darcy	89	“ Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? ”
18087	18092	18094	18094	Bingley	79	“ By all means , ”
18096	18201	18094	18094	Bingley	79	“ let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size , for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening , when he has nothing to do . ”
18245	18253	18255	18256	his friend	266	“ I see your design , Bingley , ”
18258	18270	18255	18256	his friend	266	“ You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . ”
18271	18316	18345	18346	Mr. Darcy	89	“ Perhaps I do . Arguments are too much like disputes . If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . ”
18317	18322	18324	18324	Elizabeth	82	“ What you ask , ”
18326	18344	18324	18324	Elizabeth	82	“ is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter . ”
18582	18604	18572	18573	Mr. Darcy	89	“ Do you not feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? ”
18625	18628	18630	18630	she	82	“ Oh , ”
18632	18726	18630	18630	she	82	“ I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . You wanted me , I know , to say ‘ Yes , ’ that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . I have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all ; and now despise me if you dare . ”
18727	18734	18760	18760	her	82	“ Indeed I do not dare . ”
18873	18877	18879	18879	she	91	“ I hope , ”
18893	18970	18879	18879	she	91	“ you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , to cure the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . ”
18974	18983	18879	18879	she	91	“ No , no ; stay where you are ”
18995	19007	18879	18879	she	91	“ Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity ? ”
19008	19083	18879	18879	she	91	“ Oh yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . Put them next to your great - uncle the judge . They are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines . As for your Elizabeth ’s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? ”
19084	19116	18879	18879	she	91	“ It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression ; but their colour and shape , and the eyelashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . ”
19133	19144	19146	19147	Miss Bingley	91	“ I did not know that you intended to walk , ”
19159	19166	19168	19169	Mrs. Hurst	90	“ You used us abominably ill , ”
19171	19183	19168	19169	Mrs. Hurst	90	“ running away without telling us that you were coming out . ”
19216	19235	19207	19208	Mr. Darcy	89	“ This walk is not wide enough for our party . We had better go into the avenue . ”
19252	19287	19288	19288	She	82	“ No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly grouped , and appear to uncommon advantage . The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth . Good - bye . ”
19338	19343	19349	19350	George Allen	76	“ Piling up the fire ”
19515	19519	19513	19513	he	89	“ very glad ; ”
19851	19910	19843	19843	she	91	“ How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! I declare , after all , there is no enjoyment like reading ! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book ! When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . ”
19959	20020	19952	19952	she	91	“ By the bye Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . ”
20021	20027	20029	20030	her brother	3075	“ If you mean Darcy , ”
20032	20077	19952	19952	she	91	“ he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it begins ; but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing , and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . ”
20078	20086	20087	20087	she	91	“ I should like balls infinitely better , ”
20090	20135	20087	20087	she	91	“ if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . ”
20136	20161	19952	19952	she	91	“ Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say ; but it would not be near so much like a ball . ”
20225	20262	20211	20211	she	91	“ Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . ”
20388	20393	20395	20395	her	82	“ Not at all , ”
20398	20428	20395	20395	her	82	“ but , depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it . ”
20457	20468	20470	20470	he	89	“ I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , ”
20481	20553	20470	20470	he	89	“ You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ’s confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking : if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . ”
20554	20559	20561	20562	Miss Bingley	91	“ Oh , shocking ! ”
20564	20582	20561	20562	Miss Bingley	91	“ I never heard anything so abominable . How shall we punish him for such a speech ? ”
20583	20595	20597	20597	Elizabeth	82	“ Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , ”
20599	20631	20597	20597	Elizabeth	82	“ We can all plague and punish one another . Tease him -- laugh at him . Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . ”
20632	20709	20561	20562	Miss Bingley	91	“ But upon my honour I do _ not _ . I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _ that _ . Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind ! No , no ; I feel he may defy us there . And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . Mr. Darcy may hug himself . ”
20710	20720	20722	20722	Elizabeth	82	“ Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at ! ”
20724	20762	20722	20722	Elizabeth	82	“ That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _ me _ to have many such acquaintance . I dearly love a laugh . ”
20763	20767	20769	20769	he	609	“ Miss Bingley , ”
20771	20811	20769	20769	he	609	“ has given me credit for more than can be . The wisest and best of men,--nay , the wisest and best of their actions,--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . ”
20812	20815	20817	20817	Elizabeth	82	“ Certainly , ”
20819	20887	20817	20817	Elizabeth	82	“ there are such people , but I hope I am not one of _ them _ . I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , _ do _ divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without . ”
20888	20919	20722	20722	Elizabeth	82	“ Perhaps that is not possible for anyone . But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . ”
20920	20927	20817	20817	Elizabeth	82	“ Such as vanity and pride . ”
20928	20957	20722	20722	Elizabeth	82	“ Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . But pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind -- pride will be always under good regulation . ”
20966	20978	20980	20981	Miss Bingley	91	“ Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over , I presume , ”
20983	20991	20980	20981	Miss Bingley	91	“ and pray what is the result ? ”
20992	21013	20817	20817	Elizabeth	82	“ I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect . He owns it himself without disguise . ”
21014	21017	21019	21019	Darcy	89	“ No , ”
21021	21126	21019	21019	Darcy	89	“ I have made no such pretension . I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . My temper I dare not vouch for . It is , I believe , too little yielding ; certainly too little for the convenience of the world . I can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them . My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . ”
21127	21137	21139	21139	Elizabeth	82	“ _ That _ is a failing , indeed ! ”
21141	21177	21139	21139	Elizabeth	82	“ Implacable resentment _ is _ a shade in a character . But you have chosen your fault well . I really can not _ laugh _ at it . You are safe from me . ”
21178	21208	21019	21019	Darcy	89	“ There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . ”
21209	21222	21139	21139	Elizabeth	82	“ And _ your _ defect is a propensity to hate everybody . ”
21223	21227	21228	21228	he	610	“ And yours , ”
21235	21242	21228	21228	he	610	“ is wilfully to misunderstand them . ”
21243	21252	21254	21255	Miss Bingley	91	“ Do let us have a little music , ”
21268	21280	21254	21255	Miss Bingley	91	“ Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst . ”
22097	22104	22106	22107	Mr. Bennet	74	“ I hope , my dear , ”
22121	22146	22106	22107	Mr. Bennet	74	“ that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . ”
22147	22201	22217	22218	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Who do you mean , my dear ? I know of nobody that is coming , I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in ; and I hope _ my _ dinners are good enough for her . I do not believe she often sees such at home . ”
22202	22216	22106	22107	Mr. Bennet	74	“ The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger . ”
22223	22309	22217	22218	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ A gentleman and a stranger ! It is Mr. Bingley , I am sure . Why , Jane -- you never dropped a word of this -- you sly thing ! Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley . But -- good Lord ! how unlucky ! there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day . Lydia , my love , ring the bell . I must speak to Hill this moment . ”
22310	22319	22321	22322	her husband	239	“ It is _ not _ Mr. Bingley , ”
22324	22341	22321	22322	her husband	239	“ it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . ”
22377	22440	22368	22368	himself	239	explained:--“About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it ; for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . It is from my cousin , Mr. Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . ”
22441	22447	22449	22450	his wife	215	“ Oh , my dear , ”
22452	22520	22449	22450	his wife	215	“ I can not bear to hear that mentioned . Pray do not talk of that odious man . I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure , if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . ”
22590	22599	22601	22602	Mr. Bennet	74	“ It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , ”
22604	22643	22601	22602	Mr. Bennet	74	“ and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . But if you will listen to his letter , you may , perhaps , be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . ”
22644	22698	22559	22559	she	85	“ No , that I am sure I shall not : and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . I hate such false friends . Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? ”
22699	22722	22601	22602	Mr. Bennet	74	“ Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . ”
22726	22740	22601	22602	Mr. Bennet	74	“ Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , _ 15th October _ . * /
22741	22744	22559	22559	she	85	“ Dear Sir ,
22745	22828	22830	22831	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness ; and , since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach : but , for some time , I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance . ”--‘There
22833	23167	22830	22831	Mrs. Bennet	85	’--“My mind , however , is now made up on the subject ; for , having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England . As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . I can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologize for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends ; but of this hereafter . If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o’clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend ,
23168	23172	23195	23195	he	74	“ WILLIAM COLLINS . ”
23173	23189	23195	23195	he	74	“ At four o’clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman , ”
23201	23247	23195	23195	he	74	“ He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and , I doubt not , will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . ”
23248	23285	23195	23195	he	74	“ There is some sense in what he says about the girls , however ; and , if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . ”
23286	23292	23294	23294	Jane	119	“ Though it is difficult , ”
23296	23323	23294	23294	Jane	119	“ to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . ”
23354	23364	23366	23366	she	82	“ He must be an oddity , I think , ”
23368	23421	23366	23366	she	82	“ I can not make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ? We can not suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? ”
23422	23467	23366	23366	she	82	“ No , my dear ; I think not . I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse . There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter which promises well . I am impatient to see him . ”
23468	23474	23476	23476	Mary	87	“ In point of composition , ”
23478	23506	23476	23476	Mary	87	“ his letter does not seem defective . The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . ”
23772	23810	23760	23767	Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments	85	“ You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough . Things are settled so oddly . ”
23811	23824	23760	23767	Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments	85	“ You allude , perhaps , to the entail of this estate . ”
23825	23890	23760	23767	Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments	85	“ Ah , sir , I do indeed . It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . Not that I mean to find fault with _ you _ , for such things , I know , are all chance in this world . There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . ”
23891	23958	23760	23767	Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments	85	“ I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . At present I will not say more , but , perhaps , when we are better acquainted---- ”
24470	24483	24485	24486	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , ”
24488	24523	24485	24486	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . Does she live near you , sir ? ”
24524	24548	24444	24444	she	85	“ The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her Ladyship ’s residence . ”
24549	24566	24485	24486	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ I think you said she was a widow , sir ? has she any family ? ”
24567	24585	24444	24444	she	85	“ She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property . ”
24586	24589	24591	24592	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Ah , ”
24598	24621	24595	24595	her	85	“ then she is better off than many girls . And what sort of young lady is she ? Is she handsome ? ”
24622	24742	24444	24444	she	85	“ She is a most charming young lady , indeed . Lady Catherine herself says that , in point of true beauty , Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of , as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them . But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . ”
24743	24761	24595	24595	her	85	“ Has she been presented ? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . ”
24762	24899	24444	24444	she	85	“ Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the British Court of its brightest ornament . Her Ladyship seemed pleased with the idea ; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess ; and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . ”
24900	24906	24908	24909	Mr. Bennet	74	“ You judge very properly , ”
24911	24951	24908	24909	Mr. Bennet	74	“ and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? ”
24952	24999	25000	25001	Mr. Bennet	74	“ They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time ; and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . ”
25099	25106	25145	25145	he	127	“ Protested that he never read novels ”
25181	25186	25187	25187	Lydia	83	“ Fordyce ’s Sermons . ”
25213	25275	25209	25209	she	83	“ Do you know , mamma , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard ? and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him . My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town . ”
25303	25358	25290	25291	Mr. Collins	127	“ I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . It amazes me , I confess ; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . But I will no longer importune my young cousin . ”
25894	25954	25888	25888	Jane	119	“ As to her _ younger _ daughters , she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not _ know _ of any prepossession;--her _ eldest _ daughter she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . ”
27154	27160	27163	27163	them	437	“ stupid , disagreeable fellows . ”
27908	27914	27920	27921	George Allen	76	“ The officers of the ----shire ”
28094	28104	28106	28106	he	133	“ I know little of the game at present , ”
28108	28124	28106	28106	he	133	“ but I shall be glad to improve myself ; for in my situation of life---- ”
28330	28335	28337	28337	Elizabeth	82	“ About a month , ”
28351	28366	28337	28337	Elizabeth	82	“ he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . ”
28367	28370	28372	28372	Wickham	133	“ Yes , ”
28374	28429	28372	28372	Wickham	133	“ his estate there is a noble one . A clear ten thousand per annum . You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself -- for I have been connected with his family , in a particular manner , from my infancy . ”
28437	28477	28337	28337	Elizabeth	82	“ You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy ? ”
28478	28488	28490	28490	Elizabeth	82	“ As much as I ever wish to be , ”
28494	28514	28490	28490	Elizabeth	82	“ I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . ”
28515	28527	28529	28529	Wickham	133	“ I have no right to give _ my _ opinion , ”
28531	28609	28529	28529	Wickham	133	“ as to his being agreeable or otherwise . I am not qualified to form one . I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . It is impossible for _ me _ to be impartial . But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish -- and , perhaps , you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . ”
28610	28663	28490	28490	Elizabeth	82	“ Upon my word I say no more _ here _ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . Everybody is disgusted with his pride . You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone . ”
28664	28673	28675	28675	Wickham	133	“ I can not pretend to be sorry , ”
28682	28740	28675	28675	Wickham	133	“ that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _ him _ I believe it does not often happen . The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chooses to be seen . ”
28741	28763	28490	28490	Elizabeth	82	“ I should take him , even on _ my _ slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man . ”
28770	28774	28776	28776	he	133	“ I wonder , ”
28785	28798	28776	28776	he	133	“ whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . ”
28799	28843	28490	28490	Elizabeth	82	“ I do not at all know ; but I _ heard _ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . ”
28844	29021	28776	28776	he	133	“ Oh no -- it is not for _ me _ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy . If _ he _ wishes to avoid seeing _ me _ he must go . We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding _ him _ but what I might proclaim to all the world -- a sense of very great ill - usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr. Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . ”
29091	29104	29105	29105	he	133	“ It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , ”
29108	29259	29105	29105	he	133	“ which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire . I know it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps ; and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . Society , I own , is necessary to me . I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . I _ must _ have employment and society . A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . The church _ ought _ to have been my profession -- I was brought up for the church ; and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . ”
29260	29263	29047	29048	Mr. Wickham	133	“ Indeed ! ”
29264	29330	29105	29105	he	133	“ Yes -- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift . He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . I can not do justice to his kindness . He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . ”
29331	29335	29337	29337	Elizabeth	82	“ Good heavens ! ”
29339	29363	29337	29337	Elizabeth	82	“ but how could _ that _ be ? How could his will be disregarded ? Why did not you seek legal redress ? ”
29364	29550	29105	29105	he	133	“ There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law . A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short , anything or nothing . Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it . I have a warm unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _ of _ him , and _ to _ him , too freely . I can recall nothing worse . But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . ”
29551	29564	29337	29337	Elizabeth	82	“ This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly disgraced . ”
29565	29603	29105	29105	he	133	“ Some time or other he _ will _ be -- but it shall not be by _ me _ . Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose _ him _ . ”
29622	29626	29628	29628	she	82	“ But what , ”
29634	29651	29628	29628	she	82	“ can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? ”
29652	29738	29337	29337	Elizabeth	82	“ A thorough , determined dislike of me -- a dislike which I can not but attribute in some measure to jealousy . Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him , I believe , very early in life . He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood -- the sort of preference which was often given me . ”
29739	29802	29628	29628	she	82	“ I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this -- though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him -- I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! ”
29815	29849	29812	29812	she	829	“ I _ do _ remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper . His disposition must be dreadful . ”
29850	29860	29862	29862	Wickham	133	“ I will not trust myself on the subject , ”
29864	29875	29862	29862	Wickham	133	“ _ I _ can hardly be just to him . ”
29889	29908	29876	29876	Elizabeth	82	“ To treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father ! ”
29914	29936	29876	29876	Elizabeth	82	“ A young man , too , like _ you _ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable . ”
29941	29970	29812	29812	she	829	with--“And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner . ”
29971	30146	30210	30210	Wickham	133	“ We were born in the same parish , within the same park ; the greatest part of our youth was passed together : inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care . _ My _ father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr. Philips , appears to do so much credit to ; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend . Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ’s active superintendence ; and when , immediately before my father ’s death , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _ him _ as of affection to myself . ”
30147	30151	30153	30153	Elizabeth	82	“ How strange ! ”
30155	30200	30153	30153	Elizabeth	82	“ How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you . If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it . ”
30201	30208	30210	30210	Wickham	133	“ It _ is _ wonderful , ”
30212	30267	30210	30210	Wickham	133	“ for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride . ”
30268	30281	30210	30210	Wickham	133	“ Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good ? ”
30282	30415	30210	30210	Wickham	133	“ Yes ; it has often led him to be liberal and generous ; to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . Family pride , and _ filial _ pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . He has also _ brotherly _ pride , which , with _ some _ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . ”
30416	30426	30210	30210	Wickham	133	“ What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? ”
30432	30541	30429	30429	his	830	“ I wish I could call her amiable . It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy ; but she is too much like her brother,--very , very proud . As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . But she is nothing to me now . She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , I understand , highly accomplished . Since her father ’s death her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . ”
30565	30619	30210	30210	Wickham	133	“ I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley . How can Mr. Bingley , who seems good - humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr. Bingley ? ”
30620	30625	30744	30746	The whist party	831	“ Not at all . ”
30626	30648	30210	30210	Wickham	133	“ He is a sweet - tempered , amiable , charming man . He can not know what Mr. Darcy is . ”
30649	30743	30744	30746	The whist party	831	“ Probably not ; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses . He does not want abilities . He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while . Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and , perhaps , agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure . ”
30848	30856	30858	30858	he	127	“ I know very well , madam , ”
30860	30927	30858	30858	he	127	“ that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . There are , undoubtedly , many who could not say the same ; but , thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . ”
30966	30972	30973	30973	she	82	“ Lady Catherine de Bourgh , ”
30976	31007	30973	30973	she	82	“ has very lately given him a living . I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . ”
31008	31036	30945	30945	he	127	“ You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy . ”
31037	31069	30973	30973	she	82	“ No , indeed , I did not . I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine ’s connections . I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . ”
31070	31100	31132	31132	her	82	“ Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . ”
31147	31151	31153	31153	she	82	“ Mr. Collins , ”
31155	31205	31153	31153	she	82	“ speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but , from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him ; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ”
31206	31218	31220	31220	Wickham	133	“ I believe her to be both in a great degree , ”
31222	31311	31220	31220	Wickham	133	“ I have not seen her for many years ; but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . ”
31538	31546	31536	31536	Illustration	92	“ delighted to see their dear friend again ”
31674	31679	31681	31681	she	119	“ They have both , ”
31683	31743	31681	31681	she	119	“ been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . ”
31744	31797	31681	31681	she	119	“ Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear _ them _ , too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . ”
31798	31895	31681	31681	she	119	“ Laugh as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy , to be treating his father ’s favourite in such a manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? Oh no . ”
31896	31957	31681	31681	she	119	“ I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley ’s being imposed on than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr. Darcy contradict it . Besides , there was truth in his looks . ”
31958	31977	31681	31681	she	119	“ It is difficult , indeed -- it is distressing . One does not know what to think . ”
31978	31989	31681	31681	she	119	“ I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think . ”
32361	32371	32373	32373	she	87	“ While I can have my mornings to myself , ”
32375	32419	32373	32373	she	87	“ it is enough . I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody . ”
32518	32531	32533	32533	he	127	“ I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , ”
32535	32636	32533	32533	he	127	“ that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially ; a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . ”
33222	33249	33253	33253	his	133	“ I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ”
33633	33644	33627	33627	Charlotte	101	“ I dare say you will find him very agreeable . ”
33645	33680	33627	33627	Charlotte	101	“ Heaven forbid ! _ That _ would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . ”
33870	33917	33862	33862	she	82	“ It is _ your _ turn to say something now , Mr. Darcy . _ I _ talked about the dance , and _ you _ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . ”
33935	33977	33862	33862	she	82	“ Very well ; that reply will do for the present . Perhaps , by - and - by , I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones ; but _ now _ we may be silent . ”
33978	33992	33862	33862	she	82	“ Do you talk by rule , then , while you are dancing ? ”
33993	34050	33862	33862	she	82	“ Sometimes . One must speak a little , you know . It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together ; and yet , for the advantage of _ some _ , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ”
34051	34073	33862	33862	she	82	“ Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? ”
34074	34077	34079	34079	Elizabeth	82	“ Both , ”
34082	34141	34079	34079	Elizabeth	82	“ for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the _ éclat _ of a proverb . ”
34142	34158	34160	34160	he	889	“ This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , ”
34162	34191	34160	34160	he	889	“ How near it may be to _ mine _ , I can not pretend to say . _ You _ think it a faithful portrait , undoubtedly . ”
34192	34202	34203	34203	He	889	“ I must not decide on my own performance . ”
34254	34273	34238	34238	She	82	“ When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . ”
34324	34358	34315	34315	Darcy	89	“ Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his _ making _ friends ; whether he may be equally capable of _ retaining _ them , is less certain . ”
34359	34371	34373	34373	Elizabeth	82	“ He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , ”
34378	34394	34373	34373	Elizabeth	82	“ and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . ”
34460	34591	34440	34440	he	80	“ I have been most highly gratified , indeed , my dear sir ; such very superior dancing is not often seen . It is evident that you belong to the first circles . Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you : and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza ( glancing at her sister and Bingley ) , shall take place . What congratulations will then flow in ! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you , sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . ”
34595	34605	34440	34440	he	80	“ Such very superior dancing is not often seen . ”
34680	34695	34672	34672	he	80	“ Sir William ’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . ”
34696	34751	34672	34672	he	80	“ I do not think we were speaking at all . Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I can not imagine . ”
34752	34759	34761	34761	he	80	“ What think you of books ? ”
34765	34785	34672	34672	he	80	“ Books -- oh no!--I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . ”
34786	34818	34672	34672	he	80	“ I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may compare our different opinions . ”
34819	34843	34672	34672	he	80	“ No -- I can not talk of books in a ball - room ; my head is always full of something else . ”
34844	34859	34861	34861	he	80	“ The _ present _ always occupies you in such scenes -- does it ? ”
34869	34874	34875	34875	she	897	“ Yes , always , ”
34903	34944	34899	34899	her	897	“ I remember hearing you once say , Mr. Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment , once created , was unappeasable . You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its _ being created _ ? ”
34945	34949	34951	34951	he	80	“ I am , ”
34958	34969	34899	34899	her	897	“ And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? ”
34970	34975	34899	34899	her	897	“ I hope not . ”
34976	34998	34899	34899	her	897	“ It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . ”
34999	35009	34899	34899	her	897	“ May I ask to what these questions tend ? ”
35010	35021	35023	35023	she	897	“ Merely to the illustration of _ your _ character , ”
35032	35041	35023	35023	she	897	“ I am trying to make it out . ”
35042	35049	34899	34899	her	897	“ And what is your success ? ”
35055	35076	35050	35050	She	897	“ I do not get on at all . I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . ”
35077	35083	35085	35085	he	80	“ I can readily believe , ”
35089	35137	35085	35085	he	80	“ that reports may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . ”
35138	35156	35050	35050	She	897	“ But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . ”
35157	35169	35170	35170	he	80	“ I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , ”
35255	35512	35237	35238	Miss Bingley	91	“ So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ? Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr. Darcy ’s steward . Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for , as to Mr. Darcy ’s using him ill , it is perfectly false : for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner . I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame ; that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned ; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ’s guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ”
35513	35530	35532	35532	Elizabeth	82	“ His guilt and his descent appear , by your account , to be the same , ”
35536	35574	35532	35532	Elizabeth	82	“ for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy ’s steward , and of _ that _ , I can assure you , he informed me himself . ”
35575	35581	35583	35584	Miss Bingley	91	“ I beg your pardon , ”
35592	35602	35583	35584	Miss Bingley	91	“ Excuse my interference ; it was kindly meant . ”
35603	35607	35609	35609	Elizabeth	82	“ Insolent girl ! ”
35613	35649	35609	35609	Elizabeth	82	“ You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy . ”
35744	35750	35752	35752	she	82	“ I want to know , ”
35765	35800	35752	35752	she	82	“ what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham . But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person , in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ”
35801	35804	35806	35806	Jane	119	“ No , ”
35808	35935	35806	35806	Jane	119	“ I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour , of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account , as well as his sister ’s , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy ’s regard . ”
35936	35946	35752	35752	she	82	“ Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself . ”
35947	35961	35806	35806	Jane	119	“ No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . ”
35962	35989	35752	35752	she	82	“ This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy . I am perfectly satisfied . But what does he say of the living ? ”
35990	36025	35806	35806	Jane	119	“ He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _ conditionally _ only . ”
36026	36038	36040	36040	Elizabeth	82	“ I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley ’s sincerity , ”
36043	36109	36040	36040	Elizabeth	82	“ but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . Mr. Bingley ’s defence of his friend was a very able one , I dare say ; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . ”
36224	36230	36232	36232	he	127	“ I have found out , ”
36234	36371	36232	36232	he	127	“ by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness . I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh , and of her mother , Lady Catherine . How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! Who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . ”

36385	36432	36232	36232	he	127	“ Indeed I am . I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . I believe him to be Lady Catherine ’s _ nephew _ . It will be in my power to assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight . ”
36532	36712	36718	36718	he	908	“ My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy ; for , give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . You must , therefore , allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which lead me to perform what I look on as a point of duty . Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself ; ”
36785	36788	36781	36781	his	3559	“ apology , ”
36789	36792	36781	36781	his	3559	“ Hunsford , ”
36794	36800	36781	36781	his	3559	“ Lady Catherine de Bourgh . ”
36896	36906	36908	36908	he	127	“ I have no reason , I assure you , ”
36910	36986	36908	36908	he	127	“ to be dissatisfied with my reception . Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . It was really a very handsome thought . Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . ”
37465	37509	37456	37457	Her mother	225	“ What is Mr. Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _ he _ may not like to hear . ”
37510	37545	37590	37591	Mr. Darcy	89	“ For heaven ’s sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . ”
37961	37987	37944	37944	He	228	“ That will do extremely well , child . You have delighted us long enough . Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . ”
38033	38037	38039	38040	Mr. Collins	127	“ If I , ”
38042	38269	38039	38040	Mr. Collins	127	“ were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible . And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . I can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family . ”
38921	38929	38908	38908	Lydia	83	“ Lord , how tired I am ! ”
39155	39164	39182	39182	his	127	“ to assure you in the most animated language ”
39276	39311	39269	39269	he	127	“ May I hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? ”
39328	39363	39370	39370	she	82	“ Oh dear ! Yes , certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy -- I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you upstairs . ”
39379	39420	39376	39376	Elizabeth	82	“ Dear ma’am , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr. Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear . I am going away myself . ”
39421	39439	39457	39457	she	82	“ No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you will stay where you are . ”
39460	39475	39457	39457	she	82	“ Lizzy , I _ insist _ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins . ”
39552	39716	39549	39550	Mr. Collins	127	“ Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _ not _ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother ’s permission for this address . You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . ”
39763	40336	39761	39761	he	127	“ My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and , thirdly , which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss De Bourgh ’s footstool,--that she said , ‘ Mr. Collins , you must marry . A clergyman like you must marry . Choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for _ my _ sake , and for your _ own _ ; let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . This is my advice . Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ’ Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , I think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father ( who , however , may live many years longer ) , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents . , which will not be yours till after your mother ’s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent : and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . ”
40346	40354	40355	40355	she	984	“ You are too hasty , sir , ”
40358	40413	40355	40355	she	984	“ You forget that I have made no answer . Let me do it without further loss of time . Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . ”
40414	40422	40424	40425	Mr. Collins	127	“ I am not now to learn , ”
40435	40508	40424	40425	Mr. Collins	127	“ that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . I am , therefore , by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . ”
40509	40516	40518	40518	Elizabeth	82	“ Upon my word , sir , ”
40520	40637	40518	40518	Elizabeth	82	“ your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make _ me _ happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _ you _ so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . ”
40638	40649	40651	40652	Mr. Collins	127	“ Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , ”
40655	40703	40651	40652	Mr. Collins	127	gravely--“but I can not imagine that her Ladyship would at all disapprove of you . And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . ”
40704	40815	40819	40819	she	985	“ Indeed , Mr. Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say . I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach . This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . ”
40837	40930	40832	40833	Mr. Collins	127	“ When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and , perhaps , you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . ”
40931	40937	40939	40939	Elizabeth	82	“ Really , Mr. Collins , ”
40945	40988	40939	40939	Elizabeth	82	“ you puzzle me exceedingly . If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . ”
40989	41180	40832	40833	Mr. Collins	127	“ You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course . My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into further consideration that , in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . Your portion is unhappily so small , that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . As I must , therefore , conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . ”
41181	41284	40939	40939	Elizabeth	82	“ I do assure you , sir , that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man . I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . My feelings in every respect forbid it . Can I speak plainer ? Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . ”
41285	41291	41293	41293	he	987	“ You are uniformly charming ! ”
41302	41330	41293	41293	he	987	“ and I am persuaded that , when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . ”
41594	41603	41604	41604	she	85	“ But depend upon it , Mr. Collins , ”
41607	41653	41604	41604	she	85	“ that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . I will speak to her about it myself directly . She is a very headstrong , foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will _ make _ her know it . ”
41654	41663	41665	41666	Mr. Collins	127	“ Pardon me for interrupting you , madam , ”
41668	41750	41665	41666	Mr. Collins	127	“ but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . If , therefore , she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because , if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ”
41751	41759	41761	41762	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Sir , you quite misunderstand me , ”
41766	41814	41761	41762	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . In everything else she is as good - natured a girl as ever lived . I will go directly to Mr. Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . ”
41839	41895	41896	41897	Mr. Bennet	74	“ Oh , Mr. Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins , for she vows she will not have him ; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _ her _ . ”
41930	41940	41942	41942	he	74	“ I have not the pleasure of understanding you , ”
41951	41958	41942	41942	he	74	“ Of what are you talking ? ”
41959	41988	42040	42041	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy . Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins , and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . ”
41989	42006	41942	41942	he	74	“ And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems a hopeless business . ”
42007	42025	42040	42041	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Speak to Lizzy about it yourself . Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . ”
42026	42039	41942	41942	he	74	“ Let her be called down . She shall hear my opinion . ”
42055	42061	42066	42066	she	82	“ Come here , child , ”
42069	42098	42066	42066	she	82	“ I have sent for you on an affair of importance . I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage . Is it true ? ”
42105	42118	42040	42041	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Very well -- and this offer of marriage you have refused ? ”
42119	42125	42040	42041	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ I have , sir . ”
42126	42153	42040	42041	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Very well . We now come to the point . Your mother insists upon your accepting it . Is it not so , Mrs. Bennet ? ”
42154	42165	42040	42041	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Yes , or I will never see her again . ”
42166	42220	42040	42041	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do _ not _ marry Mr. Collins , and I will never see you again if you _ do _ . ”
42257	42284	42236	42237	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ What do you mean , Mr. Bennet , by talking in this way ? You promised me to _ insist _ upon her marrying him . ”
42285	42289	42291	42292	her husband	239	“ My dear , ”
42294	42345	42291	42292	her husband	239	“ I have two small favours to request . First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and , secondly , of my room . I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . ”
42542	42582	42528	42528	Lydia	83	“ I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . ”
42586	42592	42584	42584	Illustration	92	“ they entered the breakfast room ”
42665	42674	42675	42675	she	85	“ Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , ”
42683	42709	42675	42675	she	85	“ for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me ; I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . ”
42723	42730	42732	42733	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Ay , there she comes , ”
42735	42940	42732	42733	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way . But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead . _ I _ shall not be able to keep you -- and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day . I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children . Not that I have much pleasure , indeed , in talking to anybody . People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . Those who do not complain are never pitied . ”
43006	43038	43001	43001	she	1009	“ Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together . ”
43120	43126	43113	43114	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Oh , Mr. Collins ! ”
43127	43132	43134	43134	he	127	“ My dear madam , ”
43136	43153	43154	43154	he	127	“ let us be for ever silent on this point . Far be it from me , ”
43166	43403	43154	43154	he	127	“ to resent the behaviour of your daughter . Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all : the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been , in early preferment ; and , I trust , I am resigned . Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed , that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ’s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter ’s lips instead of your own ; but we are all liable to error . I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family ; and if my _ manner _ has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologize . ”
43683	43687	43689	43689	he	265	“ I found , ”
43691	43743	43689	43689	he	265	“ as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . ”
43834	43839	43845	43846	George Allen	76	“ Walked back with them ”
44005	44056	43996	43996	Jane	119	“ This is from Caroline Bingley : what it contains has surprised me a good deal . The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . You shall hear what she says . ”
44106	44175	44182	44182	Elizabeth	82	words:--“‘I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope , at some future period , to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known , and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . I depend on you for that . ’ ”
44255	44260	44262	44262	she	82	“ It is unlucky , ”
44269	44344	44262	44262	she	82	“ that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . But may we not hope that the period of future happiness , to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them . ”
44345	44367	44238	44238	she	82	“ Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . I will read it to you .
44368	44536	44262	44262	she	82	“ ‘ When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days ; but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter : I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the crowd , but of that I despair . I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you . ’
44537	44544	44546	44546	Jane	119	“ It is evident by this , ”
44548	44558	44546	44546	Jane	119	“ that he comes back no more this winter . ”
44559	44575	44262	44262	she	82	“ It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _ should _ . ”
44576	44855	44857	44857	Jane	119	“ Why will you think so ? It must be his own doing ; he is his own master . But you do not know _ all _ . I _ will _ read you the passage which particularly hurts me . I will have no reserves from _ you _ . ‘ Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister ; and to confess the truth , _ we _ are scarcely less eager to meet her again . I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . My brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister ’s partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ’s heart . With all these circumstances to favour an attachment , and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? ’ What think you of _ this _ sentence , my dear Lizzy ? ”
44864	44935	44857	44857	Jane	119	“ Is it not clear enough ? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ’s indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard . Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? ”
44936	44953	44262	44262	she	82	“ Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? ”
44954	44958	44857	44857	Jane	119	“ Most willingly . ”
44959	45014	44262	44262	she	82	“ You shall have it in a few words . Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . ”
45020	45241	44857	44857	Jane	119	“ Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection ; Miss Bingley , I am sure , can not : she is not such a simpleton . Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . But the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _ one _ inter - marriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that , because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday ; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ”
45242	45251	45253	45253	Jane	119	“ If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , ”
45255	45300	45253	45253	Jane	119	“ your representation of all this might make me quite easy . But I know the foundation is unjust . Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . ”
45301	45350	44857	44857	Jane	119	“ That is right . You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine : believe her to be deceived , by all means . You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . ”
45351	45384	45253	45253	Jane	119	“ But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? ”
45385	45392	45394	45394	Elizabeth	82	“ You must decide for yourself , ”
45396	45438	45394	45394	Elizabeth	82	“ and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you , by all means , to refuse him . ”
45439	45446	45448	45448	Jane	119	“ How can you talk so ? ”
45453	45475	45448	45448	Jane	119	“ you must know , that , though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . ”
45476	45500	45394	45394	Elizabeth	82	“ I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I can not consider your situation with much compassion . ”
45501	45527	45448	45448	Jane	119	“ But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . A thousand things may arise in six months . ”
45825	45833	45835	45835	she	82	“ It keeps him in good humour , ”
45837	45850	45835	45835	she	82	“ and I am more obliged to you than I can express . ”
46332	46338	46314	46315	Lady Lucas	81	“ So much love and eloquence ”
46832	46837	46838	46838	he	127	“ My dear madam , ”
46841	46877	46838	46838	he	127	“ this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . ”
46901	46933	46878	46878	They	233	“ But is there not danger of Lady Catherine ’s disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness . ”
46934	46939	46941	46942	Mr. Collins	127	“ My dear sir , ”
46944	46974	46941	46942	Mr. Collins	127	“ I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her Ladyship ’s concurrence . ”
46975	47033	46878	46878	They	233	“ You can not be too much on your guard . Risk anything rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that _ we _ shall take no offence . ”
47034	47124	47148	47149	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and , depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . ”
47345	47357	47339	47339	she	101	“ Engaged to Mr. Collins ! my dear Charlotte , impossible ! ”
47404	47446	47395	47395	she	101	“ Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman ’s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? ”
47494	47502	47504	47504	Charlotte	101	“ I see what you are feeling , ”
47506	47609	47504	47504	Charlotte	101	“ you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you . But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . I am not romantic , you know . I never was . I ask only a comfortable home ; and , considering Mr. Collins ’s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . ”
47613	47616	47610	47610	Elizabeth	82	“ undoubtedly ; ”
47796	47804	47810	47811	George Allen	76	“ Protested he must be entirely mistaken . ”
47926	47953	47916	47916	Lydia	83	“ Good Lord ! Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? ”
49288	49298	49286	49286	Illustration	92	“ _ Whenever she spoke in a low voice _ ”
49436	49442	49444	49444	she	119	“ Indeed , Mr. Bennet , ”
49446	49490	49444	49444	she	119	“ it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that _ I _ should be forced to make way for _ her _ , and live to see her take my place in it ! ”
49491	49524	49544	49544	she	119	“ My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . Let us hope for better things . Let us flatter ourselves that _ I _ may be the survivor . ”
49550	49579	49544	49544	she	119	“ I can not bear to think that they should have all this estate . If it was not for the entail , I should not mind it . ”
49580	49587	49544	49544	she	119	“ What should not you mind ? ”
49588	49597	49544	49544	she	119	“ I should not mind anything at all . ”
49598	49614	49544	49544	she	119	“ Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . ”
49615	49675	49544	49544	she	119	“ I never can be thankful , Mr. Bennet , for anything about the entail . How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ’s own daughters I can not understand ; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins , too ! Why should _ he _ have it more than anybody else ? ”
49676	49685	49687	49688	Mr. Bennet	74	“ I leave it to yourself to determine , ”
50191	50248	50186	50186	she	115	“ O that my dear mother had more command over herself ! she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . But I will not repine . It can not last long . He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . ”
50262	50267	50269	50269	Jane	119	“ You doubt me , ”
50274	50341	50269	50269	Jane	119	“ indeed , you have no reason . He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all . I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . Thank God I have not _ that _ pain . A little time , therefore -- I shall certainly try to get the better---- ”
50350	50384	50346	50346	she	119	“ I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself . ”
50385	50390	50392	50392	Elizabeth	82	“ My dear Jane , ”
50394	50436	50392	50392	Elizabeth	82	“ you are too good . Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to you . I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . ”
50457	50460	50462	50462	Elizabeth	82	“ Nay , ”
50464	50634	50462	50462	Elizabeth	82	“ this is not fair . _ You _ wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody . _ I _ only want to think _ you _ perfect , and you set yourself against it . Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good - will . You need not . There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well . The more I see of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . I have met with two instances lately : one I will not mention , the other is Charlotte ’s marriage . It is unaccountable ! in every view it is unaccountable ! ”
50635	50728	50437	50438	Miss Bennet	82	“ My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . They will ruin your happiness . You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . Consider Mr. Collins ’s respectability , and Charlotte ’s prudent , steady character . Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for everybody ’s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . ”
50729	50892	50462	50462	Elizabeth	82	“ To oblige you , I would try to believe almost anything , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart . My dear Jane , Mr. Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man : you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him can not have a proper way of thinking . You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger security for happiness . ”
50893	50906	50908	50908	Jane	119	“ I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , ”
50910	51031	50908	50908	Jane	119	“ and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . But enough of this . You alluded to something else . You mentioned _ two _ instances . I can not misunderstand you , but I entreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _ that person _ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect . It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us . Women fancy admiration means more than it does . ”
51032	51041	50462	50462	Elizabeth	82	“ And men take care that they should . ”
51042	51074	50908	50908	Jane	119	“ If it is designedly done , they can not be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . ”
51075	51091	51093	51093	Elizabeth	82	“ I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley ’s conduct to design , ”
51095	51141	51093	51093	Elizabeth	82	“ but , without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error and there may be misery . Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ’s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . ”
51142	51153	50908	50908	Jane	119	“ And do you impute it to either of those ? ”
51154	51187	51093	51093	Elizabeth	82	“ Yes ; to the last . But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . Stop me , whilst you can . ”
51188	51201	50908	50908	Jane	119	“ You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him ? ”
51202	51211	51093	51093	Elizabeth	82	“ Yes , in conjunction with his friend . ”
51212	51248	50908	50908	Jane	119	“ I can not believe it . Why should they try to influence him ? They can only wish his happiness ; and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it . ”
51249	51297	51093	51093	Elizabeth	82	“ Your first position is false . They may wish many things besides his happiness : they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . ”
51298	51311	51313	51313	Jane	119	“ Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy , ”
51315	51495	51313	51313	Jane	119	“ but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ’s . What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . By supposing such an affection , you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy . Do not distress me by the idea . I am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . ”
51650	51655	51657	51657	he	74	“ So , Lizzy , ”
51662	51771	51657	51657	he	74	“ your sister is crossed in love , I find . I congratulate her . Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . When is your turn to come ? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane . Now is your time . Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . Let Wickham be your man . He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . ”
51772	51797	51880	51881	general unreserve	1154	“ Thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . We must not all expect Jane ’s good fortune . ”
51798	51801	51803	51804	Mr. Bennet	74	“ True , ”
51806	51838	51803	51804	Mr. Bennet	74	“ but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . ”
52351	52358	52359	52359	she	85	“ I do not blame Jane , ”
52362	52547	52359	52359	she	85	“ for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could . But , Lizzy ! Oh , sister ! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins ’s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . The Lucases are very artful people , indeed , sister . They are all for what they can get . I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves . ”
52607	52620	52622	52622	she	82	“ It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , ”
52624	52685	52622	52622	she	82	“ I am sorry it went off . But these things happen so often ! A young man , such as you describe Mr. Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and , when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . ”
52689	52696	52600	52600	she	123	“ Offended two or three young ladies ”
52708	52716	52718	52718	Elizabeth	82	“ An excellent consolation in its way , ”
52720	52776	52718	52718	Elizabeth	82	“ but it will not do for _ us _ . We do not suffer by accident . It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . ”
52777	52842	52600	52600	she	123	“ But that expression of ‘ violently in love ’ is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . It is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour ’s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . Pray , how _ violent was _ Mr. Bingley ’s love ? ”
52843	52925	52718	52718	Elizabeth	82	“ I never saw a more promising inclination ; he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance ; and I spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer . Could there be finer symptoms ? Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? ”
52926	53026	52600	52600	she	123	“ Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . Poor Jane ! I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . It had better have happened to _ you _ , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? Change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything . ”
53045	53049	53051	53052	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ I hope , ”
53054	53117	53051	53052	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . ”
53118	53223	53051	53052	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ And _ that _ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? Mr. Darcy may , perhaps , have _ heard _ of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and , depend upon it , Mr. Bingley never stirs without him . ”
53224	53259	53051	53052	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ So much the better . I hope they will not meet at all . But does not Jane correspond with his sister ? _ She _ will not be able to help calling . ”
53260	53268	53051	53052	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ She will drop the acquaintance entirely . ”
53821	53829	53864	53864	she	123	“ Will you come and see me ? ”
53868	54029	53864	53864	she	123	“ You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him , in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . I have nothing to say against _ him _ : he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . But as it is -- you must not let your fancy run away with you . You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . Your father would depend on _ your _ resolution and good conduct , I am sure . You must not disappoint your father . ”
54030	54041	53834	53835	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . ”
54042	54056	53864	53864	she	123	“ Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . ”
54057	54098	53834	53835	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . I will take care of myself , and of Mr. Wickham too . He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . ”
54099	54108	53864	53864	she	123	“ Elizabeth , you are not serious now . ”
54109	54368	53834	53835	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ I beg your pardon . I will try again . At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw -- and if he becomes really attached to me -- I believe it will be better that he should not . I see the imprudence of it . Oh , _ that _ abominable Mr. Darcy ! My father ’s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to forfeit it . My father , however , is partial to Mr. Wickham . In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see , every day , that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld , by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow - creatures , if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wiser to resist ? All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . In short , I will do my best . ”
54369	54400	53834	53835	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often . At least you should not _ remind _ your mother of inviting him . ”
54401	54409	54411	54411	Elizabeth	82	“ As I did the other day , ”
54418	54507	54411	54411	Elizabeth	82	“ very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _ that _ . But do not imagine that he is always here so often . It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . You know my mother ’s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now I hope you are satisfied . ”
54620	54629	54592	54592	she	85	“ _ wished _ they might be happy . ”
54691	54704	54689	54689	Charlotte	101	“ I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . ”
54705	54713	54689	54689	Charlotte	101	“ _ That _ you certainly shall . ”
54714	54730	54689	54689	Charlotte	101	“ And I have another favour to ask . Will you come and see me ? ”
54731	54743	54689	54689	Charlotte	101	“ We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . ”
54744	54766	54689	54689	Charlotte	101	“ I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . ”
54781	54794	54796	54796	Charlotte	101	“ My father and Maria are to come to me in March , ”
54798	54827	54796	54796	Charlotte	101	“ and I hope you will consent to be of the party . Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . ”
55177	55181	55182	55182	she	119	“ My aunt , ”
55185	55210	55182	55182	she	119	“ is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street . ”
55227	55236	55238	55238	her	119	“ I did not think Caroline in spirits , ”
55241	55348	55238	55238	her	119	“ but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . I inquired after their brother , of course . He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him . I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner : I wish I could see her . My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out . I dare say I shall soon see them here . ”
55482	56048	55469	55469	she	119	“ My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ’s regard for me . But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but , if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the meantime . When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was , in every respect , so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . I pity , though I can not help blaming , her . She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable . I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . I can not understand it . If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . Let me hear from you very soon . Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . We had better not mention it . I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . I am sure you will be very comfortable there .
56049	56054	56079	56080	the sister	1232	“ Yours , etc . ”
56393	56594	56390	56390	she	123	on:--“I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . But my feelings are not only cordial towards _ him _ , they are even impartial towards Miss King . I can not find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . There can be no love in all this . My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance . Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do . They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain . ”
56598	56602	56390	56390	she	123	“ On the Stairs ”
57424	57431	57432	57432	she	123	“ But , my dear Elizabeth , ”
57435	57454	57432	57432	she	123	“ what sort of girl is Miss King ? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . ”
57455	57530	57432	57432	she	123	“ Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . ”
57531	57553	57432	57432	she	123	“ If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . ”
57554	57574	57432	57432	she	123	“ She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . I know no harm of her . ”
57575	57596	57432	57432	she	123	“ But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather ’s death made her mistress of this fortune ? ”
57597	57648	57432	57432	she	123	“ No -- why should he ? If it were not allowable for him to gain _ my _ affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? ”
57649	57666	57432	57432	she	123	“ But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event . ”
57667	57703	57432	57432	she	123	“ A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe . If _ she _ does not object to it , why should _ we _ ? ”
57704	57731	57432	57432	she	123	“ _ Her _ not objecting does not justify _ him _ . It only shows her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling . ”
57732	57735	57737	57737	Elizabeth	82	“ Well , ”
57739	57761	57737	57737	Elizabeth	82	“ have it as you choose . _ He _ shall be mercenary , and _ she _ shall be foolish . ”
57762	57800	57432	57432	she	123	“ No , Lizzy , that is what I do _ not _ choose . I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . ”
57801	57887	57737	57737	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh , if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . I am sick of them all . Thank heaven ! I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him . Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . ”
57888	57901	57432	57432	she	123	“ Take care , Lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . ”
57940	57953	57955	57956	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , ”
57958	57966	57955	57956	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ but perhaps , to the Lakes . ”
57989	57996	57997	57997	she	82	“ My dear , dear aunt , ”
58001	58140	57997	57997	she	82	“ what delight ! what felicity ! You give me fresh life and vigour . Adieu to disappointment and spleen . What are men to rocks and mountains ? Oh , what hours of transport we shall spend ! And when we _ do _ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of anything . We _ will _ know where we have gone -- we _ will _ recollect what we have seen . Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . Let _ our _ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . ”
58144	58148	57997	57997	she	82	“ At the door ”
59040	59185	59034	59035	Mr. Collins	127	“ Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . Her Ladyship ’s carriage is regularly ordered for us . I _ should _ say , one of her Ladyship ’s carriages , for she has several . ”
59186	59199	59201	59201	Charlotte	101	“ Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman , indeed , ”
59203	59210	59201	59201	Charlotte	101	“ and a most attentive neighbour . ”
59211	59241	59034	59035	Mr. Collins	127	“ Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . She is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference . ”
59437	59443	59419	59419	Maria	95	“ In Conversation with the ladies ”
59453	59499	59419	59419	Maria	95	“ Oh , my dear Eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! I will not tell you what it is . Make haste , and come down this moment . ”
59548	59554	59556	59556	Elizabeth	82	“ And is this all ? ”
59558	59583	59556	59556	Elizabeth	82	“ I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! ”
59584	59590	59592	59592	Maria	95	“ La ! my dear , ”
59600	59650	59592	59592	Maria	95	“ it is not Lady Catherine . The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson , who lives with them . The other is Miss De Bourgh . Only look at her . She is quite a little creature . Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! ”
59651	59674	59556	59556	Elizabeth	82	“ She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind . Why does she not come in ? ”
59675	59698	59592	59592	Maria	95	“ Oh , Charlotte says she hardly ever does . It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . ”
59699	59705	59707	59707	Elizabeth	82	“ I like her appearance , ”
59714	59740	59707	59707	Elizabeth	82	“ She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . She will make him a very proper wife . ”
59967	59971	59973	59973	he	80	“ I confess , ”
59975	60060	59973	59973	he	80	“ that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation , moreover , including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ? ”
60061	60072	60074	60075	Sir William	80	“ I am the less surprised at what has happened , ”
60077	60115	60074	60075	Sir William	80	“ from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . About the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . ”
60182	60265	60178	60178	he	127	“ Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter . I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest -- there is no occasion for anything more . Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . ”
61493	61511	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ Your father ’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins , I think ? For your sake , ”
61516	61559	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh ’s family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? ”
61560	61564	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ A little . ”
61565	61606	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ Oh then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to ---- you shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? ”
61607	61613	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ One of them does . ”
61614	61651	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as yours . Do you draw ? ”
61652	61659	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ No , not at all . ”
61660	61667	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ What , none of you ? ”
61668	61672	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ Not one . ”
61673	61703	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ That is very strange . But I suppose you had no opportunity . Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . ”
61704	61718	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ My mother would have no objection , but my father hates London . ”
61719	61726	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ Has your governess left you ? ”
61727	61734	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ We never had any governess . ”
61735	61774	61489	61490	Lady Catherine	86	“ No governess ! How was that possible ? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . ”
61792	61813	61782	61782	she	82	“ Then who taught you ? who attended to you ? Without a governess , you must have been neglected . ”
61814	61863	61782	61782	she	82	“ Compared with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means . We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . Those who chose to be idle certainly might . ”
61864	62050	61782	61782	she	82	“ Ay , no doubt : but that is what a governess will prevent ; and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way . I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe ’s calling yesterday to thank me ? She finds Miss Pope a treasure . ‘ Lady Catherine , ’ said she , ‘ you have given me a treasure . ’ Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? ”
62051	62058	61782	61782	she	82	“ Yes , ma’am , all . ”
62059	62097	61782	61782	she	82	“ All ! What , all five out at once ? Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? ”
62098	62207	61782	61782	she	82	“ Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . Perhaps _ she _ is full young to be much in company . But really , ma’am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first . And to be kept back on _ such _ a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . ”
62208	62213	62215	62216	her Ladyship	3398	“ Upon my word , ”
62218	62238	62215	62216	her Ladyship	3398	“ you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? ”
62239	62247	62249	62249	Elizabeth	82	“ With three younger sisters grown up , ”
62253	62264	62249	62249	Elizabeth	82	“ your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . ”
62298	62317	62265	62266	Lady Catherine	86	“ You can not be more than twenty , I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age . ”
62318	62328	62347	62348	Lady Catherine	86	“ I am not one - and - twenty . ”
63257	63264	63231	63231	she	82	“ he never failed to inform them ”
63652	63658	63664	63665	George Allen	76	“ The gentlemen accompanied him . ”
63795	63822	63763	63763	Charlotte	101	“ I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . ”
64028	64049	64011	64011	She	82	“ My eldest sister has been in town these three months . Have you never happened to see her there ? ”
64122	64125	64081	64081	she	82	“ At Church ”
64505	64537	64498	64498	she	3398	“ What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? What is it you are talking of ? What are you telling Miss Bennet ? Let me hear what it is . ”
64538	64547	64549	64549	he	162	“ We were talking of music , madam , ”
64560	64665	64498	64498	she	3398	“ Of music ! Then pray speak aloud . It is of all subjects my delight . I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient . And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? ”
64678	64692	64694	64695	Lady Catherine	86	“ I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , ”
64697	64722	64694	64695	Lady Catherine	86	“ and pray tell her from me , that she can not expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal . ”
64723	64730	64731	64731	he	89	“ I assure you , madam , ”
64734	64748	64731	64731	he	89	“ that she does not need such advice . She practises very constantly . ”
64749	64879	64880	64881	Mr. Darcy	89	“ So much the better . It can not be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice . I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson ’s room . She would be in nobody ’s way , you know , in that part of the house . ”
65009	65076	64986	64986	Elizabeth	82	“ You mean to frighten me , Mr. Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me . But I will not be alarmed , though your sister _ does _ play so well . There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . ”
65077	65087	65088	65088	he	89	“ I shall not say that you are mistaken , ”
65091	65140	65088	65088	he	89	“ because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which , in fact , are not your own . ”
65156	65275	65141	65141	Elizabeth	82	“ Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . Indeed , Mr. Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear . ”
65276	65284	65286	65286	he	1481	“ I am not afraid of you , ”
65290	65303	65305	65306	Colonel Fitzwilliam	162	“ Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , ”
65308	65320	65305	65306	Colonel Fitzwilliam	162	“ I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . ”
65321	65427	65141	65141	Elizabeth	82	“ You shall hear , then -- but prepare for something very dreadful . The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ? He danced only four dances ! I am sorry to pain you , but so it was . He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . Mr. Darcy , you can not deny the fact . ”
65428	65449	65305	65306	Colonel Fitzwilliam	162	“ I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . ”
65450	65482	65141	65141	Elizabeth	82	“ True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball - room . Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? My fingers wait your orders . ”
65483	65486	65488	65488	Darcy	89	“ Perhaps , ”
65490	65514	65488	65488	Darcy	89	“ I should have judged better had I sought an introduction , but I am ill - qualified to recommend myself to strangers . ”
65515	65526	65528	65528	Elizabeth	82	“ Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? ”
65535	65566	65532	65533	Colonel Fitzwilliam	162	“ Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill - qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? ”
65567	65574	65576	65576	Fitzwilliam	162	“ I can answer your question , ”
65578	65595	65576	65576	Fitzwilliam	162	“ without applying to him . It is because he will not give himself the trouble . ”
65596	65608	65610	65610	Darcy	89	“ I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , ”
65612	65646	65610	65610	Darcy	89	“ of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . I can not catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . ”
65647	65651	65653	65653	Elizabeth	82	“ My fingers , ”
65655	65738	65653	65653	Elizabeth	82	“ do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women ’s do . They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because I would not take the trouble of practising . It is not that I do not believe _ my _ fingers as capable as any other woman ’s of superior execution . ”
65744	65780	65739	65739	Darcy	89	“ You are perfectly right . You have employed your time much better . No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting . We neither of us perform to strangers . ”
65822	65881	65806	65807	Lady Catherine	86	“ Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master . She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne ’s . Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . ”
66218	66281	66216	66216	she	82	“ How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr. Darcy ! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London ? ”
66282	66290	66291	66291	She	82	“ Perfectly so , I thank you . ”
66310	66330	66291	66291	She	82	“ I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? ”
66331	66378	66216	66216	she	82	“ I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . ”
66379	66456	66291	66291	She	82	“ If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . But , perhaps , Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ”
66457	66464	66466	66466	Darcy	89	“ I should not be surprised , ”
66468	66484	66466	66466	Darcy	89	“ if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ”
66531	66559	66522	66522	He	89	“ This seems a very comfortable house . Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford . ”
66560	66583	66522	66522	He	89	“ I believe she did -- and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . ”
66584	66597	66522	66522	He	89	“ Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . ”
66598	66686	66522	66522	He	89	“ Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . My friend has an excellent understanding -- though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . She seems perfectly happy , however ; and , in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . ”
66687	66710	66522	66522	He	89	“ It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . ”
66711	66726	66522	66522	He	89	“ An easy distance do you call it ? It is nearly fifty miles . ”
66727	66756	66522	66522	He	89	“ And what is fifty miles of good road ? Little more than half a day ’s journey . Yes , I call it a very easy distance . ”
66757	66776	66778	66778	Elizabeth	82	“ I should never have considered the distance as one of the _ advantages _ of the match , ”
66780	66796	66778	66778	Elizabeth	82	“ I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled _ near _ her family . ”
66797	66824	66826	66826	he	1496	“ It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . ”
66860	66968	66841	66841	he	1496	“ I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . Where there is fortune to make the expense of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . But that is not the case _ here _ . Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _ near _ her family under less than _ half _ the present distance . ”
66982	67009	66972	66972	his	89	“ _ You _ can not have a right to such very strong local attachment . _ You _ can not have been always at Longbourn . ”
67047	67054	67022	67022	he	89	“ Are you pleased with Kent ? ”
67140	67145	67151	67152	George Allen	76	“ Accompanied by their aunt ”
67157	67166	67168	67168	Charlotte	101	“ What can be the meaning of this ? ”
67177	67203	67168	67168	Charlotte	101	“ My dear Eliza , he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . ”
68179	68192	68177	68177	she	82	“ I did not know before that you ever walked this way . ”
68193	68204	68205	68205	he	162	“ I have been making the tour of the park , ”
68208	68234	68205	68205	he	162	“ as I generally do every year , and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage . Are you going much farther ? ”
68235	68246	68177	68177	she	82	“ No , I should have turned in a moment . ”
68261	68270	68272	68272	she	82	“ Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? ”
68274	68302	68177	68177	she	82	“ Yes -- if Darcy does not put it off again . But I am at his disposal . He arranges the business just as he pleases . ”
68303	68348	68177	68177	she	82	“ And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy . ”
68349	68360	68362	68363	Colonel Fitzwilliam	162	“ He likes to have his own way very well , ”
68365	68419	68362	68363	Colonel Fitzwilliam	162	“ But so we all do . It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . I speak feelingly . A younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . ”
68420	68477	68177	68177	she	82	“ In my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either . Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for ? ”
68478	68525	68362	68363	Colonel Fitzwilliam	162	“ These are home questions -- and perhaps I can not say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature . But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . Younger sons can not marry where they like . ”
68526	68543	68177	68177	she	82	“ Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . ”
68544	68575	68362	68363	Colonel Fitzwilliam	162	“ Our habits of expense make us too dependent , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . ”
68576	68580	68582	68582	Elizabeth	82	“ Is this , ”
68584	68589	68591	68591	she	82	“ meant for me ? ”
68608	68643	68600	68600	herself	82	“ And pray , what is the usual price of an earl ’s younger son ? Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . ”
68677	68746	68673	68673	she	82	“ I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . But , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present ; and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . ”
68747	68750	68752	68753	Colonel Fitzwilliam	162	“ No , ”
68755	68779	68752	68753	Colonel Fitzwilliam	162	“ that is an advantage which he must divide with me . I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . ”
68780	68836	68838	68838	she	1528	“ Are you , indeed ? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make ? Does your charge give you much trouble ? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage ; and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . ”
68887	68949	68884	68884	She	1528	“ You need not be frightened . I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley . I think I have heard you say that you know them . ”
68950	68975	68884	68884	She	1528	“ I know them a little . Their brother is a pleasant , gentlemanlike man -- he is a great friend of Darcy ’s . ”
68976	68980	68982	68982	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh yes , ”
68983	69003	68884	68884	She	1528	drily--“Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . ”
69004	69081	68884	68884	She	1528	“ Care of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy _ does _ take care of him in those points where he most wants care . From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . It was all conjecture . ”
69082	69089	68884	68884	She	1528	“ What is it you mean ? ”
69090	69126	68884	68884	She	1528	“ It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ’s family it would be an unpleasant thing . ”
69127	69137	68884	68884	She	1528	“ You may depend upon my not mentioning it . ”
69138	69229	68884	68884	She	1528	“ And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . What he told me was merely this : that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars ; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . ”
69230	69242	68884	68884	She	1528	“ Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? ”
69243	69257	68884	68884	She	1528	“ I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . ”
69258	69269	68884	68884	She	1528	“ And what arts did he use to separate them ? ”
69270	69282	69284	69284	Fitzwilliam	89	“ He did not talk to me of his own arts , ”
69288	69300	69284	69284	Fitzwilliam	89	“ He only told me what I have now told you . ”
69331	69343	69345	69345	she	82	“ I am thinking of what you have been telling me , ”
69347	69366	69345	69345	she	82	“ Your cousin ’s conduct does not suit my feelings . Why was he to be the judge ? ”
69367	69378	69322	69322	Fitzwilliam	89	“ You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? ”
69379	69427	69428	69428	she	82	“ I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ’s inclination ; or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . But , ”
69434	69466	69428	69428	she	82	“ as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . ”
69467	69475	69477	69477	Fitzwilliam	89	“ That is not an unnatural surmise , ”
69479	69494	69477	69477	Fitzwilliam	89	“ but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ’s triumph very sadly . ”
69724	69735	69737	69738	Colonel Fitzwilliam	162	“ There were some very strong objections against the lady , ”
69768	69773	69774	69774	she	82	“ To Jane herself , ”
69777	69840	69774	69774	she	82	“ there could be no possibility of objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is ! Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . Neither could anything be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ”
70486	70520	70474	70474	he	89	“ In vain have I struggled . It will not do . My feelings will not be repressed . You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . ”
70825	70957	70823	70823	she	82	“ In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could _ feel _ gratitude , I would now thank you . But I cannot -- I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone . It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . The feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . ”
71053	71102	71051	71051	he	89	“ And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _ endeavour _ at civility , I am thus rejected . But it is of small importance . ”
71103	71110	71112	71112	she	82	“ I might as well inquire , ”
71114	71231	71112	71112	she	82	“ why , with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I _ was _ uncivil ? But I have other provocations . You know I have . Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? ”
71260	71350	71351	71351	She	82	“ I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _ there _ . You dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . ”
71390	71400	71401	71401	she	82	“ Can you deny that you have done it ? ”
71411	71453	71407	71407	he	89	“ I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . Towards _ him _ I have been kinder than towards myself . ”
71479	71488	71489	71489	she	82	“ But it is not merely this affair , ”
71492	71565	71489	71489	she	82	“ on which my dislike is founded . Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham . On this subject , what can you have to say ? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others ? ”
71566	71578	71580	71580	Darcy	89	“ You take an eager interest in that gentleman ’s concerns , ”
71594	71611	71489	71489	she	82	“ Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him ? ”
71612	71616	71618	71618	Darcy	89	“ His misfortunes ! ”
71620	71629	71618	71618	Darcy	89	contemptuously,--“yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . ”
71630	71636	71638	71638	Elizabeth	82	“ And of your infliction , ”
71643	71717	71638	71638	Elizabeth	82	“ You have reduced him to his present state of poverty -- comparative poverty . You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him . You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert . You have done all this ! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . ”
71718	71722	71724	71724	Darcy	89	“ And this , ”
71736	71778	71780	71780	he	89	“ is your opinion of me ! This is the estimation in which you hold me ! I thank you for explaining it so fully . My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! But , perhaps , ”
71792	71922	71780	71780	he	89	“ these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I , with greater policy , concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by everything . But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . They were natural and just . Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? ”
71945	71993	71943	71943	she	82	“ You are mistaken , Mr. Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ”
72009	72034	72007	72007	she	82	“ You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ”
72058	72156	72055	72055	She	82	“ From the very beginning , from the first moment , I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . ”
72157	72209	72214	72214	he	1559	“ You have said quite enough , madam . I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . ”
72806	72835	72793	72793	she	82	“ I have been walking in the grove some time , in the hope of meeting you . Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? ”
72937	73074	72915	72915	she	82	“ Be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you . I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice .
73075	75892	72915	72915	she	82	“ Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham . Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours , I can only say that I am sorry . The necessity must be obeyed , and further apology would be absurd . I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country . But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . I had often seen him in love before . At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas ’s accidental information , that Bingley ’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided . From that moment I observed my friend ’s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard ; and I remained convinced , from the evening ’s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment . If _ you _ have not been mistaken here , _ I _ must have been in an error . Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain ; but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears . I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . But there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . These causes must be stated , though briefly . The situation of your mother ’s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend you . But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say , farther , that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . The part which I acted is now to be explained . His sisters ’ uneasiness had been equally excited with my own : our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went -- and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice . I described and enforced them earnestly . But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance , which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ’s indifference . He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal , regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point . To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . I can not blame myself for having done thus much . There is but one part of my conduct , in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ’s being in town . I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley ; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence is , perhaps , probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . It is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . If I have wounded your sister ’s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr. Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . Of what he has _ particularly _ accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ; and on George Wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ’s education . My father was not only fond of this young man ’s society , whose manners were always engaging , he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . The vicious propensities , the want of principle , which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr. Darcy could not have . Here again I shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell . But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character . It adds even another motive . My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant . There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . His own father did not long survive mine ; and within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . I rather wished than believed him to be sincere ; but , at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman . The business was therefore soon settled . He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . All connection between us seemed now dissolved . I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . In town , I believe , he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence ; and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father ’s intentions . You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it . His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself . After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropped . How he lived , I know not . But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ’s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr. Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement . She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement ; and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . Regard for my sister ’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure ; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge . Mr. Wickham ’s chief object was unquestionably my sister ’s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement . His revenge would have been complete indeed . This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham . I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood , he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at , ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either . Detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . For the truth of everything here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who , from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ’s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . If your abhorrence of _ me _ should make _ my _ assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . I will only add , God bless you .
75893	75897	72915	72915	she	82	“ FITZWILLIAM DARCY . ”
76232	76248	76222	76222	She	82	“ This must be false ! This can not be ! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and
77542	77549	77550	77550	she	82	“ How despicably have I acted ! ”
77553	77683	77550	77550	she	82	“ I , who have prided myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust . How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind . But vanity , not love , has been my folly . Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away where either were concerned . Till this moment , I never knew myself . ”
78358	78371	78377	78377	she	82	“ What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? ”
78393	78403	78405	78406	Lady Catherine	86	“ I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , ”
78408	78494	78405	78406	Lady Catherine	86	“ I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! But so they always are . The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely -- more , I think , than last year . His attachment to Rosings certainly increases . ”
78557	78595	78555	78555	she	86	“ But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . ”
78596	78609	78611	78611	Elizabeth	82	“ I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation , ”
78613	78633	78611	78611	Elizabeth	82	“ but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . ”
78634	78688	78555	78555	she	86	“ Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . I expected you to stay two months . I told Mrs. Collins so before you came . There can be no occasion for your going so soon . Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . ”
78689	78705	78611	78611	Elizabeth	82	“ But my father can not . He wrote last week to hurry my return . ”
78706	78828	78555	78555	she	86	“ Oh , your father , of course , may spare you , if your mother can . Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father . And if you will stay another _ month _ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche - box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and , indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . ”
78829	78848	78611	78611	Elizabeth	82	“ You are all kindness , madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . ”
78854	79032	78849	78850	Lady Catherine	86	“ Mrs. Collins , you must send a servant with them . You know I always speak my mind , and I can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . It is highly improper . You must contrive to send somebody . I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men - servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr. Darcy of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs. Collins . I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _ you _ to let them go alone . ”
79033	79044	78849	78850	Lady Catherine	86	“ My uncle is to send a servant for us . ”
79045	79102	78849	78850	Lady Catherine	86	“ Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man - servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . Where shall you change horses ? Oh , Bromley , of course . If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to . ”
79846	79854	79856	79856	he	127	“ I know not , Miss Elizabeth , ”
79858	79985	79856	79856	he	127	“ whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us ; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly . ”
80043	80202	80031	80032	Mr. Collins	127	“ It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome . Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine ’s family is , indeed , the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . You see on what a footing we are . You see how continually we are engaged there . In truth , I must acknowledge , that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . ”
80237	80385	80214	80214	he	1641	“ You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . I flatter myself , at least , that you will be able to do so . Lady Catherine ’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent . Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . We seem to have been designed for each other . ”
80650	80653	80654	80654	he	127	“ But , ”
80657	80687	80654	80654	he	127	“ you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . ”
80708	80712	80714	80714	Maria	95	“ Good gracious ! ”
80723	80744	80714	80714	Maria	95	“ it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! ”
80745	80751	80753	80754	her companion	1659	“ A great many indeed , ”
80760	80783	80714	80714	Maria	95	“ We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! ”
80788	80798	80784	80784	Elizabeth	82	“ And how much I shall have to conceal ! ”
81148	81161	81128	81128	they	1671	“ Is not this nice ? is not this an agreeable surprise ? ”
81162	81171	81173	81173	Lydia	83	“ And we mean to treat you all , ”
81175	81196	81173	81173	Lydia	83	“ but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . ”
81200	81254	81264	81264	she	83	purchases,--“Look here , I have bought this bonnet . I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . ”
81271	81338	81264	81264	she	83	“ Oh , but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the ----shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . ”
81339	81345	81347	81347	Elizabeth	82	“ Are they , indeed ? ”
81354	81421	81264	81264	she	83	“ They are going to be encamped near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all . Mamma would like to go , too , of all things ! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! ”
81422	81425	81427	81427	Elizabeth	82	“ Yes , ”
81429	81482	81427	81427	Elizabeth	82	“ _ that _ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . Good Heaven ! Brighton and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton ! ”
81483	81493	81495	81495	Lydia	83	“ Now I have got some news for you , ”
81504	81528	81495	81495	Lydia	83	“ What do you think ? It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . ”
81553	81677	81548	81548	Lydia	83	“ Ay , that is just like your formality and discretion . You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say . But he is an ugly fellow ! I am glad he is gone . I never saw such a long chin in my life . Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? There is no danger of Wickham ’s marrying Mary King -- there ’s for you ! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ; gone to stay . Wickham is safe . ”
81678	81685	81687	81687	Elizabeth	82	“ And Mary King is safe ! ”
81689	81699	81687	81687	Elizabeth	82	“ safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . ”
81700	81715	81548	81548	Lydia	83	“ She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . ”
81716	81729	81731	81731	Jane	119	“ But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , ”
81733	81771	81548	81548	Lydia	83	“ I am sure there is not on _ his _ . I will answer for it , he never cared three straws about her . Who _ could _ about such a nasty little freckled thing ? ”
81866	81874	81876	81876	Lydia	83	“ How nicely we are crammed in ! ”
81878	82307	81876	81876	Lydia	83	“ I am glad I brought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another band - box ! Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home . And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away . Have you seen any pleasant men ? Have you had any flirting ? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . She is almost three - and - twenty ! Lord ! how ashamed I should be of not being married before three - and - twenty ! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands you ca n’t think . She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins ; but _ I _ do not think there would have been any fun in it . Lord ! how I should like to be married before any of you ! and then I would _ chaperon _ you about to all the balls . Dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster ’s ! Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by - the - bye , Mrs. Forster and me are _ such _ friends ! ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come : but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman ’s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun ! Not a soul knew of it , but Colonel and Mrs. Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you can not imagine how well he looked ! When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . Lord ! how I laughed ! and so did Mrs. Forster . I thought I should have died . And _ that _ made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . ”
82393	82404	82405	82405	Their	1684	“ I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . ”
82528	82533	82535	82535	she	83	“ Oh , Mary , ”
82537	82694	82535	82535	she	83	“ I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . And then when we came away it was such fun ! I thought we never should have got into the coach . I was ready to die of laughter . And then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that anybody might have heard us ten miles off ! ”
82703	82751	82698	82698	Mary	87	“ Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures . They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . But I confess they would have no charms for _ me _ . I should infinitely prefer a book . ”
83125	83135	83137	83137	she	82	“ His being so sure of succeeding was wrong , ”
83139	83158	83137	83137	she	82	“ and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . ”
83159	83162	83164	83164	Elizabeth	82	“ Indeed , ”
83166	83202	83164	83164	Elizabeth	82	“ I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? ”
83203	83211	83137	83137	she	82	“ Blame you ! Oh , no . ”
83212	83225	83164	83164	Elizabeth	82	“ But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham ? ”
83226	83243	83137	83137	she	82	“ No -- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . ”
83244	83265	83164	83164	Elizabeth	82	“ But you _ will _ know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . ”
83368	83374	83376	83376	Elizabeth	82	“ This will not do , ”
83378	83461	83376	83376	Elizabeth	82	“ you never will be able to make both of them good for anything . Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy ’s , but you shall do as you choose . ”
83478	83490	83492	83492	she	119	“ I do not know when I have been more shocked , ”
83494	83562	83492	83492	she	119	“ Wickham so very bad ! It is almost past belief . And poor Mr. Darcy ! dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . Such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! It is really too distressing , I am sure you must feel it so . ”
83563	83629	83348	83348	she	119	“ Oh no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . Your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . ”
83630	83654	83492	83492	she	119	“ Poor Wickham ! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his manner . ”
83655	83687	83348	83348	she	119	“ There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men . One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . ”
83688	83709	83492	83492	she	119	“ I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _ appearance _ of it as you used to do . ”
83710	83785	83348	83348	she	119	“ And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . It is such a spur to one ’s genius , such an opening for wit , to have a dislike of that kind . One may be continually abusive without saying anything just ; but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . ”
83786	83810	83492	83492	she	119	“ Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . ”
83811	83881	83348	83348	she	119	“ Indeed , I could not . I was uncomfortable enough , I was very uncomfortable -- I may say unhappy . And with no one to speak to of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me , and say that I had not been so very weak , and vain , and nonsensical , as I knew I had ! Oh , how I wanted you ! ”
83882	83912	83492	83492	she	119	“ How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy , for now they _ do _ appear wholly undeserved . ”
83913	83971	83348	83348	she	119	“ Certainly . But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . There is one point on which I want your advice . I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham ’s character . ”
83982	84001	83972	83973	Miss Bennet	82	“ Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . What is your own opinion ? ”
84002	84161	83492	83492	she	119	“ That it ought not to be attempted . Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public . On the contrary , every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . I am not equal to it . Wickham will soon be gone ; and , therefore , it will not signify to anybody here what he really is . Some time hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . At present I will say nothing about it . ”
84162	84209	83972	83973	Miss Bennet	82	“ You are quite right . To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . He is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character . We must not make him desperate . ”
84339	84343	84345	84345	she	82	“ And then , ”
84347	84393	84345	84345	she	82	“ if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . The liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! ”
84522	84527	84529	84530	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Well , Lizzy , ”
84535	84651	84529	84530	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ what is your opinion _ now _ of this sad business of Jane ’s ? For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . I told my sister Philips so the other day . But I can not find out that Jane saw anything of him in London . Well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have inquired of everybody , too , who is likely to know . ”
84652	84667	84768	84769	her mother	225	“ I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . ”
84668	84744	84529	84530	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Oh , well ! it is just as he chooses . Nobody wants him to come ; though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and , if I was her , I would not have put up with it . Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . ”
84761	84766	84768	84769	her mother	225	“ Well , Lizzy , ”
84774	84845	84768	84769	her mother	225	“ and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? Well , well , I only hope it will last . And what sort of table do they keep ? Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say . If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . There is nothing extravagant in _ their _ housekeeping , I dare say . ”
84846	84853	84768	84769	her mother	225	“ No , nothing at all . ”
84854	84936	84768	84769	her mother	225	“ A great deal of good management , depend upon it . Yes , yes . _ They _ will take care not to outrun their income . _ They _ will never be distressed for money . Well , much good may it do them ! And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . ”
84937	84950	84768	84769	her mother	225	“ It was a subject which they could not mention before me . ”
84951	85014	84768	84769	her mother	225	“ No ; it would have been strange if they had . But I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves . Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . _ I _ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . ”
85121	85138	85140	85140	they	1720	“ Good Heaven ! What is to become of us ? What are we to do ? ”
85149	85159	85140	85140	they	1720	“ How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? ”
85187	85192	85194	85194	she	1726	“ I am sure , ”
85196	85220	85194	85194	she	1726	“ I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller ’s regiment went away . I thought I should have broke my heart . ”
85221	85232	85234	85234	Lydia	83	“ I am sure I shall break _ mine _ , ”
85236	85245	85247	85248	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ If one could but go to Brighton ! ”
85250	85266	85194	85194	she	1726	“ Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton ! But papa is so disagreeable . ”
85267	85280	85194	85194	she	1726	“ A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever . ”
85281	85300	85302	85302	Kitty	86	“ And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _ me _ a great deal of good , ”
85538	85557	85559	85559	she	86	“ I can not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _ me _ as well as Lydia , ”
85561	85596	85559	85559	she	86	“ though I am _ not _ her particular friend . I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . ”
85749	85791	85741	85741	He	228	“ Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . ”
85792	85798	85800	85800	Elizabeth	82	“ If you were aware , ”
85802	85847	85800	85800	Elizabeth	82	“ of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ’s unguarded and imprudent manner , nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . ”
85848	85852	85854	85855	Mr. Bennet	74	“ Already arisen ! ”
85857	85921	85854	85855	Mr. Bennet	74	“ What ! has she frightened away some of your lovers ? Poor little Lizzy ! But do not be cast down . Such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret . Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ’s folly . ”
85922	86178	86179	86180	Mr. Bennet	74	“ Indeed , you are mistaken . I have no such injuries to resent . It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining . Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ’s character . Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly . If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . Her character will be fixed ; and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . She will follow wherever Lydia leads . Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrolled ! Oh , my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? ”
86202	86376	86179	86180	Mr. Bennet	74	“ Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or I may say , three -- very silly sisters . We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . Let her go , then . Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody . At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . The officers will find women better worth their notice . Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . ”
87033	87045	87028	87028	he	133	“ How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? ”
87046	87051	87028	87028	he	133	“ Nearly three weeks . ”
87052	87059	87028	87028	he	133	“ And you saw him frequently ? ”
87060	87067	87028	87028	he	133	“ Yes , almost every day . ”
87068	87079	87028	87028	he	133	“ His manners are very different from his cousin ’s . ”
87080	87095	87028	87028	he	133	“ Yes , very different ; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance . ”
87096	87099	87101	87101	Wickham	133	“ Indeed ! ”
87112	87118	87123	87123	he	133	“ And pray may I ask-- ”
87131	87159	87160	87160	he	133	“ Is it in address that he improves ? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style ? for I dare not hope , ”
87171	87179	87160	87160	he	133	“ that he is improved in essentials . ”
87180	87185	87187	87187	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh , no ! ”
87189	87205	87187	87187	Elizabeth	82	“ In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . ”
87249	87290	87247	87247	she	82	“ When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement ; but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . ”
87332	87494	87319	87319	he	133	“ You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right . His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by . I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . His fear of her has always operated , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . ”
88372	88378	88380	88380	she	82	“ But it is fortunate , ”
88382	88463	88380	88380	she	82	“ that I have something to wish for . Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister ’s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized . A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . ”
89056	89060	89062	89062	she	82	“ But surely , ”
89064	89087	89062	89062	she	82	“ I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars , without his perceiving me . ”
89443	89463	89465	89466	her aunt	1187	“ My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? ”
89468	89494	89465	89466	her aunt	1187	“ A place , too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . ”
89555	89566	89568	89568	she	123	“ If it were merely a fine house richly furnished , ”
89570	89596	89568	89568	she	123	“ I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . They have some of the finest woods in the country . ”
90373	90379	90381	90381	she	82	“ And of this place , ”
90383	90434	90436	90436	herself	82	“ I might have been mistress ! With these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted ! Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But , no , ”
90438	90465	90436	90436	herself	82	“ that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; I should not have been allowed to invite them . ”
90532	90548	90522	90523	Mrs. Reynolds	178	“ But we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . ”
90652	90661	90662	90662	she	800	“ He is now gone into the army , ”
90665	90677	90662	90662	she	800	“ but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . ”
90695	90699	90701	90702	Mrs. Reynolds	178	“ And that , ”
90711	90737	90701	90702	Mrs. Reynolds	178	“ is my master -- and very like him . It was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago . ”
90738	90750	90752	90753	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ I have heard much of your master ’s fine person , ”
90760	90782	90752	90753	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ it is a handsome face . But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . ”
90801	90810	90783	90784	Mrs. Reynolds	178	“ Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy ? ”
90817	90821	90811	90811	Elizabeth	82	“ A little . ”
90822	90836	90783	90784	Mrs. Reynolds	178	“ And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma’am ? ”
90837	90843	90811	90811	Elizabeth	82	“ Yes , very handsome . ”
90844	90903	90783	90784	Mrs. Reynolds	178	“ I am sure _ I _ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . This room was my late master ’s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . He was very fond of them . ”
90937	90948	90950	90951	Mr. Gardiner	149	“ And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? ”
90953	91008	91009	91010	Mr. Gardiner	149	“ Oh , yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! She plays and sings all day long . In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master : she comes here to - morrow with him . ”
91050	91064	91009	91010	Mr. Gardiner	149	“ Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? ”
91065	91099	91009	91010	Mr. Gardiner	149	“ Not so much as I could wish , sir : but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . ”
91100	91103	91105	91105	Elizabeth	82	“ Except , ”
91107	91114	91105	91105	Elizabeth	82	“ when she goes to Ramsgate . ”
91115	91129	91009	91010	Mr. Gardiner	149	“ If your master would marry , you might see more of him . ”
91130	91158	91105	91105	Elizabeth	82	“ Yes , sir ; but I do not know when _ that _ will be . I do not know who is good enough for him . ”
91171	91190	91165	91165	Elizabeth	82	“ It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . ”
91191	91209	91211	91212	the other	3332	“ I say no more than the truth , and what everybody will say that knows him , ”
91233	91260	91229	91230	the housekeeper	800	“ I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . ”
91311	91334	91307	91308	her uncle	557	“ There are very few people of whom so much can be said . You are lucky in having such a master . ”
91335	91404	91405	91405	Elizabeth	82	“ Yes , sir , I know I am . If I were to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . But I have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous - hearted boy in the world . ”
91411	91418	91420	91420	she	82	“ Can this be Mr. Darcy ? ”
91422	91430	91432	91433	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ His father was an excellent man , ”
91435	91461	91405	91405	Elizabeth	82	“ Yes , ma’am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor . ”
91557	91569	91571	91571	she	82	“ He is the best landlord , and the best master , ”
91573	91650	91571	91571	she	82	“ that ever lived . Not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves . There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw anything of it . To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . ”
91651	91662	91664	91664	Elizabeth	82	“ In what an amiable light does this place him ! ”
91666	91673	91675	91676	her aunt	1187	“ This fine account of him , ”
91681	91694	91675	91676	her aunt	1187	“ is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . ”
91695	91702	91675	91676	her aunt	1187	“ Perhaps we might be deceived . ”
91703	91716	91675	91676	her aunt	1187	“ That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . ”
91778	91786	91788	91788	Elizabeth	82	“ He is certainly a good brother , ”
91814	91824	91825	91825	she	178	“ And this is always the way with him , ”
91828	91856	91825	91825	she	178	“ Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . There is nothing he would not do for her . ”
93709	93712	93688	93688	she	82	“ delightful , ”
93714	93717	93688	93688	she	82	“ charming , ”
93825	93832	93834	93834	she	82	“ What will be his surprise , ”
93836	93853	93834	93834	she	82	“ when he knows who they are ! He takes them now for people of fashion . ”
94132	94193	94129	94129	she	82	“ Why is he so altered ? From what can it proceed ? It can not be for _ me _ , it can not be for _ my _ sake that his manners are thus softened . My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . It is impossible that he should still love me . ”
94333	94337	94338	94338	she	567	unexpected--“for your housekeeper , ”
94341	94377	94338	94338	she	567	“ informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and , indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . ”
94414	94424	94425	94425	he	239	“ They will join me early to - morrow , ”
94428	94447	94425	94425	he	239	“ and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr . Bingley and his sisters . ”
94496	94507	94508	94508	he	239	“ There is also one other person in the party , ”
94514	94550	94508	94508	he	239	“ who more particularly wishes to be known to you . Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? ”
94895	94908	94910	94911	her uncle	557	“ He is perfectly well - behaved , polite , and unassuming , ”
94913	94929	94931	94932	her aunt	1187	“ There _ is _ something a little stately in him , to be sure , ”
94934	94974	94931	94932	her aunt	1187	“ but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _ I _ have seen nothing of it . ”
94975	95016	94931	94932	her aunt	1187	“ I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . ”
95017	95024	95026	95027	her aunt	1187	“ To be sure , Lizzy , ”
95029	95067	95026	95027	her aunt	1187	“ he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham ’s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? ”
95105	95118	95120	95121	her uncle	557	“ But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , ”
95123	95159	95120	95121	her uncle	557	“ Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ”
95174	95183	95185	95186	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ From what we have seen of him , ”
95188	95317	95185	95186	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham . He has not an ill - natured look . On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . But , to be sure , the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character ! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and _ that _ , in the eye of a servant , comprehends every virtue . ”
96670	96686	96694	96694	he	79	“ was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; ”
96697	96723	96694	96694	he	79	“ It is above eight months . We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . ”
99195	99222	99170	99171	Miss Bingley	91	“ Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton ? They must be a great loss to _ your _ family . ”
99728	99741	99742	99742	she	91	“ How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr. Darcy , ”
99745	99785	99742	99742	she	91	“ I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter . She is grown so brown and coarse ! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . ”
99823	99829	99830	99830	she	91	“ For my own part , ”
99833	99952	99830	99830	she	91	“ I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . Her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive anything extraordinary in them . They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . ”
100018	100100	100016	100016	she	91	“ I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ‘ _ She _ a beauty ! I should as soon call her mother a wit . ’ But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . ”
100101	100104	100106	100106	Darcy	89	“ Yes , ”
100115	100148	100106	100106	Darcy	89	“ but _ that _ was only when I first knew her ; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . ”
100474	100801	100813	100813	she	2192	“ Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well . What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! Imagine our surprise . To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . I am very , very sorry . So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . Our poor mother is sadly grieved . My father bears it better . How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . The express was sent off directly . My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . I must conclude , for I can not be long from my poor mother . I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . ”
100854	101634	100804	100804	herself	2192	“ By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I can not answer for being coherent . Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it can not be delayed . Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . Though Lydia ’s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F. , who , instantly taking the alarm , set off from B. , intending to trace their route . He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place , they removed into a hackney - coach , and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . I know not what to think . After making every possible inquiry on that side of London , Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success,--no such people had been seen to pass through . With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F. ; but no one can throw any blame on them . Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . My father and mother believe the worst , but I can not think so ill of him . Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _ he _ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia ’s connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to everything ? Impossible ! I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage : he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted . My poor mother is really ill , and keeps her room . Could she exert herself , it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence , one can not wonder . I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now , as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . Adieu ! I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not ; but circumstances are such , that I can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible . I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to - morrow evening . In such an exigence my uncle ’s advice and assistance would be everything in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness . ”
101635	101645	101647	101647	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? ”
101731	101766	101714	101714	she	82	“ I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that can not be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . ”
101767	101776	101778	101778	he	2193	“ Good God ! what is the matter ? ”
101790	101827	101778	101778	he	2193	“ I will not detain you a minute ; but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner . You are not well enough ; you can not go yourself . ”
101930	101965	101911	101911	Darcy	89	“ Let me call your maid . Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . ”
101966	101973	101974	101974	she	82	“ No , I thank you , ”
101982	102012	101974	101974	she	82	“ There is nothing the matter with me . I am quite well , I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . ”
102062	102150	102058	102058	she	82	“ I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . It can not be concealed from anyone . My youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped ; has thrown herself into the power of -- of Mr. Wickham . They are gone off together from Brighton . _ You _ know him too well to doubt the rest . She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever . ”
102157	102162	102163	102163	she	82	“ When I consider , ”
102173	102236	102163	102163	she	82	“ that _ I _ might have prevented it ! _ I _ who knew what he was . Had I but explained some part of it only -- some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! Had his character been known , this could not have happened . But it is all , all too late now . ”
102237	102244	102246	102246	Darcy	89	“ I am grieved , indeed , ”
102248	102261	102246	102246	Darcy	89	“ grieved -- shocked . But is it certain , absolutely certain ? ”
102262	102294	102163	102163	she	82	“ Oh , yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond : they are certainly not gone to Scotland . ”
102295	102311	102246	102246	Darcy	89	“ And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? ”
102312	102393	102163	102163	she	82	“ My father has gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ’s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . How is such a man to be worked on ? How are they even to be discovered ? I have not the smallest hope . It is every way horrible ! ”
102402	102448	102449	102449	Darcy	89	“ When _ my _ eyes were opened to his real character , oh ! had I known what I ought , what I dared to do ! But I knew not -- I was afraid of doing too much . Wretched , wretched mistake ! ”
102678	102776	102658	102659	her companion	1659	“ I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern . Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress ! But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister ’s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day . ”
102777	102822	102823	102823	He	2205	“ Oh , yes ! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy . Say that urgent business calls us home immediately . Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it can not be long . ”
103600	103610	103612	103613	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ But what is to be done about Pemberley ? ”
103615	103631	103612	103613	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so ? ”
103632	103656	103612	103613	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . _ That _ is all settled . ”
103657	103663	103665	103666	the other	3332	“ What is all settled ? ”
103677	103702	103669	103669	she	3332	“ And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ? Oh , that I knew how it was ! ”
103867	103878	103880	103881	her uncle	557	“ I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , ”
103890	104005	103880	103881	her uncle	557	“ and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his Colonel ’s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? His temptation is not adequate to the risk . ”
104006	104013	104015	104015	Elizabeth	82	“ Do you really think so ? ”
104023	104028	104030	104031	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ Upon my word , ”
104033	104098	104030	104031	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ I begin to be of your uncle ’s opinion . It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . I can not think so very ill of Wickham . Can you , yourself , Lizzie , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? ”
104099	104151	103880	103881	her uncle	557	“ Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . If , indeed , it should be so ! But I dare not hope it . Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? ”
104152	104158	104160	104161	Mr. Gardiner	149	“ In the first place , ”
104163	104177	104160	104161	Mr. Gardiner	149	“ there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . ”
104178	104213	103880	103881	her uncle	557	“ Oh , but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption ! And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road . ”
104214	104280	104160	104161	Mr. Gardiner	149	“ Well , then,--supposing them to be in London -- they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose . It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . ”
104281	104510	103880	103881	her uncle	557	“ But why all this secrecy ? Why any fear of detection ? Why must their marriage be private ? Oh , no , no -- this is not likely . His most particular friend , you see by Jane ’s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . He can not afford it . And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ’s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _ he _ would do as little and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ”
104511	104542	104160	104161	Mr. Gardiner	149	“ But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? ”
104543	104556	104558	104558	Elizabeth	82	“ It does seem , and it is most shocking , indeed , ”
104566	104753	104558	104558	Elizabeth	82	“ that a sister ’s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . But , really , I know not what to say . Perhaps I am not doing her justice . But she is very young : she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . She has been doing everything in her power , by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . ”
104754	104761	104763	104764	her aunt	1187	“ But you see that Jane , ”
104766	104784	104763	104764	her aunt	1187	“ does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . ”
104785	104873	104558	104558	Elizabeth	82	“ Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . ”
104874	104883	104885	104886	Mrs. Gardiner	123	“ And do you really know all this ? ”
104901	104907	104909	104909	Elizabeth	82	“ I do , indeed , ”
104913	105036	104909	104909	Elizabeth	82	“ I told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless . From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . Yet he knew to the contrary himself . He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . ”
105037	105061	104558	104558	Elizabeth	82	“ But does Lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? ”
105062	105245	104909	104909	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh , yes!--that , that is the worst of all . Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . And when I returned home the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight ’s time . As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone , that the good opinion , which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . That _ she _ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . That such a consequence as _ this _ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . ”
105246	105272	104558	104558	Elizabeth	82	“ When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other ? ”
105273	105407	104909	104909	Elizabeth	82	“ Not the slightest . I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away . When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months : but he never distinguished _ her _ by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . ”
105667	105671	105673	105673	Jane	119	“ Not yet , ”
105675	105692	105673	105673	Jane	119	“ But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope everything will be well . ”
105693	105700	105639	105639	she	82	“ Is my father in town ? ”
105701	105715	105673	105673	Jane	119	“ Yes , he went on Tuesday , as I wrote you word . ”
105716	105725	105639	105639	she	82	“ And have you heard from him often ? ”
105726	105786	105673	105673	Jane	119	“ We have heard only once . He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . ”
105787	105801	105639	105639	she	82	“ And my mother -- how is she ? How are you all ? ”
105802	105854	105673	105673	Jane	119	“ My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . She is upstairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . She does not yet leave her dressing - room . Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! are quite well . ”
105855	105863	105865	105865	Elizabeth	82	“ But you -- how are you ? ”
105867	105880	105865	105865	Elizabeth	82	“ You look pale . How much you must have gone through ! ”
106119	106126	106128	106128	she	85	“ If I had been able , ”
106130	106317	106128	106128	she	85	“ to carry my point in going to Brighton with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened : but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am . Poor , dear child ! And now here ’s Mr. Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . ”
106369	106378	106380	106380	he	74	“ Do not give way to useless alarm , ”
106382	106498	106380	106380	he	74	“ though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . In a few days more , we may gain some news of them ; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . ”
106499	106506	106508	106509	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Oh , my dear brother , ”
106511	106710	106508	106509	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ that is exactly what I could most wish for . And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _ make _ them marry . And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married . And , above all things , keep Mr. Bennet from fighting . Tell him what a dreadful state I am in -- that I am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at my heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . Oh , brother , how kind you are ! I know you will contrive it all . ”
106991	107031	107041	107041	she	2287	“ This is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of . But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . ”
107044	107113	107041	107041	she	2287	“ Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable , that one false step involves her in endless ruin , that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . ”
107232	107280	107224	107225	the former	367	“ But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard . Give me further particulars . What did Colonel Forster say ? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ? They must have seen them together for ever . ”
107281	107367	107224	107225	the former	367	“ Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia ’s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . I am so grieved for him . His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . He _ was _ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . ”
107368	107396	107224	107225	the former	367	“ And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? Did he know of their intending to go off ? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? ”
107397	107454	107224	107225	the former	367	“ Yes ; but when questioned by _ him _ , Denny denied knowing anything of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying , and from _ that _ I am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before . ”
107455	107480	107224	107225	the former	367	“ And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? ”
107481	107598	107224	107225	the former	367	“ How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ? I felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister ’s happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . My father and mother knew nothing of that ; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia ’s last letter she had prepared her for such a step . She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other many weeks . ”
107599	107608	107224	107225	the former	367	“ But not before they went to Brighton ? ”
107609	107616	107224	107225	the former	367	“ No , I believe not . ”
107617	107637	107224	107225	the former	367	“ And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? Does he know his real character ? ”
107638	107693	107224	107225	the former	367	“ I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant ; and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt : but I hope this may be false . ”
107694	107720	107224	107225	the former	367	“ Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! ”
107721	107729	107731	107732	her sister	308	“ Perhaps it would have been better , ”
107734	107756	107224	107225	the former	367	“ But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . ”
107757	107765	107224	107225	the former	367	“ We acted with the best intentions . ”
107766	107781	107224	107225	the former	367	“ Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia ’s note to his wife ? ”
107782	107793	107224	107225	the former	367	“ He brought it with him for us to see . ”
107817	107823	107224	107225	the former	367	“ My dear Harriet , * /
107824	108077	107224	107225	the former	367	“ You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I can not help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . I am going to Gretna Green , and if you can not guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham . What a good joke it will be ! I can hardly write for laughing . Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to - night . Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure . I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up . Good - bye . Give my love to Colonel Forster . I hope you will drink to our good journey .
108078	108082	107224	107225	the former	367	“ Your affectionate friend ,
108083	108087	107224	107225	the former	367	“ LYDIA BENNET . ”
108088	108096	108098	108098	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh , thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! ”
108105	108170	108098	108098	Elizabeth	82	“ What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment ! But at least it shows that _ she _ was serious in the object of her journey . Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _ scheme _ of infamy . My poor father ! how he must have felt it ! ”
108171	108205	107224	107225	the former	367	“ I never saw anyone so shocked . He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! ”
108206	108211	108213	108213	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh , Jane , ”
108215	108237	108213	108213	Elizabeth	82	“ was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? ”
108238	108310	107224	107225	the former	367	“ I do not know : I hope there was . But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult . My mother was in hysterics ; and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done . But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties . ”
108311	108348	107224	107225	the former	367	“ Your attendance upon her has been too much for you . You do not look well . Oh that I had been with you ! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . ”
108349	108482	107224	107225	the former	367	“ Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . She was of great use and comfort to us all , and Lady Lucas has been very kind : she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . ”
108483	108492	108494	108494	Elizabeth	82	“ She had better have stayed at home , ”
108496	108545	108494	108494	Elizabeth	82	“ perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one ’s neighbours . Assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable . Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . ”
108573	108580	108582	108582	Jane	119	“ He meant , I believe , ”
108584	108757	108582	108582	Jane	119	“ to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if anything could be made out from them . His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ’s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked , he meant to make inquiries at Clapham . If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make inquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . I do not know of any other designs that he had formed ; but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . ”
109379	109513	109348	109348	He	149	“ I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ’s intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . If there were anyone that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . At present we have nothing to guide us . Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head . But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person . ”
109763	109769	109737	109737	Elizabeth	82	“ My dear Sir , * /
109770	110171	109737	109737	Elizabeth	82	“ I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . Be assured , my dear sir , that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be , of all others , most afflicting to a parent ’s mind . The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others : for who , as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ? And this consideration leads me , moreover , to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last November ; for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . Let me advise you , then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .
110172	110179	109737	109737	Elizabeth	82	“ I am , dear sir , ”
110406	110410	110411	110411	she	119	“ A gamester ! ”
110414	110428	110411	110411	she	119	“ This is wholly unexpected ; I had not an idea of it . ”
110536	110549	110550	110550	she	85	“ What ! is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ? ”
110553	110583	110550	110550	she	85	“ Sure he will not leave London before he has found them . Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? ”
110906	110932	110903	110903	he	74	“ Say nothing of that . Who should suffer but myself ? It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . ”
110933	110943	110945	110945	Elizabeth	82	“ You must not be too severe upon yourself , ”
110947	111005	110894	110894	her	82	“ You may well warn me against such an evil . Human nature is so prone to fall into it ! No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . It will pass away soon enough . ”
111006	111016	111079	111079	he	228	“ Do you suppose them to be in London ? ”
111017	111029	110894	110894	her	82	“ Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? ”
111030	111041	111043	111043	Kitty	86	“ And Lydia used to want to go to London , ”
111045	111052	111054	111055	her father	228	“ She is happy , then , ”
111059	111071	111054	111055	her father	228	“ and her residence there will probably be of some duration . ”
111082	111115	111079	111079	he	228	“ Lizzy , I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shows some greatness of mind . ”
111132	111138	111140	111140	he	228	“ This is a parade , ”
111142	111196	111140	111140	he	228	“ which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my nightcap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away . ”
111197	111208	111210	111210	Kitty	86	“ I am not going to run away , papa , ”
111214	111232	111210	111210	Kitty	86	“ If _ I _ should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . ”
111233	111340	111140	111140	he	228	“ _ You _ go to Brighton ! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne , for fifty pounds ! No , Kitty , I have at least learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . And you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . ”
111357	111362	111364	111364	he	2357	“ Well , well , ”
111366	111398	111364	111364	he	2357	“ do not make yourself unhappy . If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . ”
111468	111505	111462	111462	she	800	“ I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . ”
111506	111521	111462	111462	she	800	“ What do you mean , Hill ? We have heard nothing from town . ”
111522	111526	111528	111529	Mrs. Hill	126	“ Dear madam , ”
111535	111566	111528	111529	Mrs. Hill	126	“ do n’t you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner ? He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . ”
111628	111647	111623	111624	the butler	2368	“ If you are looking for my master , ma’am , he is walking towards the little copse . ”
111727	111745	111711	111712	her sister	308	“ Oh , papa , what news ? what news ? have you heard from my uncle ? ”
111746	111759	111812	111812	his	231	“ Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . ”
111760	111774	111711	111712	her sister	308	“ Well , and what news does it bring -- good or bad ? ”
111775	111785	111787	111787	he	231	“ What is there of good to be expected ? ”
111796	111806	111787	111787	he	231	“ but perhaps you would like to read it . ”
111820	111825	111827	111828	their father	231	“ Read it aloud , ”
111830	111841	111827	111828	their father	231	“ for I hardly know myself what it is about . ”
111845	111857	111827	111828	their father	231	“ Gracechurch Street , _ Monday , August 2 _ . * /
111858	111862	111827	111828	their father	231	“ My dear Brother ,
111863	111938	111827	111828	their father	231	“ At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . The particulars I reserve till we meet . It is enough to know they are discovered : I have seen them both---- ”
111939	111948	111950	111950	Jane	119	“ Then it is as I always hoped , ”
111952	111957	111950	111950	Jane	119	“ they are married ! ”
111962	112326	111958	111958	Elizabeth	82	“ I have seen them both . They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . These are conditions which , considering everything , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr. Wickham ’s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care . Send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly . We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . She comes to us to - day . I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on . Yours , etc .
112327	112332	112415	112415	she	82	“ EDW . GARDINER . ”
112333	112338	112340	112340	Elizabeth	82	“ Is it possible ? ”
112347	112358	112343	112343	she	82	“ Can it be possible that he will marry her ? ”
112359	112374	112376	112377	her sister	308	“ Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him , ”
112379	112388	112376	112377	her sister	308	“ My dear father , I congratulate you . ”
112389	112397	112399	112399	Elizabeth	82	“ And have you answered the letter ? ”
112401	112411	112415	112415	she	82	“ No ; but it must be done soon . ”
112428	112435	112436	112436	she	82	“ Oh ! my dear father , ”
112439	112457	112436	112436	she	82	“ come back and write immediately . Consider how important every moment is in such a case . ”
112458	112465	112467	112467	Jane	119	“ Let me write for you , ”
112469	112477	112467	112467	Jane	119	“ if you dislike the trouble yourself . ”
112478	112485	112486	112486	he	2378	“ I dislike it very much , ”
112489	112496	112486	112486	he	2378	“ but it must be done . ”
112513	112520	112522	112522	Elizabeth	82	“ And -- may I ask ? ”
112524	112537	112522	112522	Elizabeth	82	“ but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . ”
112538	112552	112467	112467	Jane	119	“ Complied with ! I am only ashamed of his asking so little . ”
112553	112570	112522	112522	Elizabeth	82	“ And they _ must _ marry ! Yet he is _ such _ a man . ”
112571	112627	112467	112467	Jane	119	“ Yes , yes , they must marry . There is nothing else to be done . But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . ”
112628	112634	112636	112636	Jane	119	“ Money ! my uncle ! ”
112638	112646	112636	112636	Jane	119	“ what do you mean , sir ? ”
112647	112681	112467	112467	Jane	119	“ I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . ”
112682	112688	112690	112690	Elizabeth	82	“ That is very true , ”
112692	112746	112690	112690	Elizabeth	82	“ though it had not occurred to me before . His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! Oh , it must be my uncle ’s doings ! Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . A small sum could not do all this . ”
112747	112750	112752	112753	her father	228	“ No , ”
112755	112792	112752	112753	her father	228	“ Wickham ’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds : I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . ”
112793	112811	112752	112753	her father	228	“ Ten thousand pounds ! Heaven forbid ! How is half such a sum to be repaid ? ”
112855	112864	112866	112866	Elizabeth	82	“ And they are really to be married ! ”
112876	112923	112866	112866	Elizabeth	82	“ How strange this is ! and for _ this _ we are to be thankful . That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! Oh , Lydia ! ”
112924	112931	112933	112933	Jane	119	“ I comfort myself with thinking , ”
112935	113004	112933	112933	Jane	119	“ that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced . He has children of his own , and may have more . How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? ”
113005	113020	113022	113022	Elizabeth	82	“ If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ’s debts have been , ”
113024	113140	113022	113022	Elizabeth	82	“ and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own . The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge . By this time she is actually with them ! If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! ”
113141	113155	113157	113157	Jane	119	“ We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , ”
113159	113229	113157	113157	Jane	119	“ I hope and trust they will yet be happy . His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . ”
113230	113237	113239	113239	Elizabeth	82	“ Their conduct has been such , ”
113241	113264	113239	113239	Elizabeth	82	“ as neither you , nor I , nor anybody , can ever forget . It is useless to talk of it . ”
113323	113329	113310	113310	He	231	“ Just as you please . ”
113330	113343	113310	113310	He	231	“ May we take my uncle ’s letter to read to her ? ”
113344	113354	113310	113310	He	231	“ Take whatever you like , and get away . ”
113493	113500	113501	113501	she	119	“ My dear , dear Lydia ! ”
113504	113646	113501	113501	she	119	“ this is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be -- I knew he would manage everything . How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too ! But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . Stay , stay , I will go myself . Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill . I will put on my things in a moment . My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! ”
113679	113688	113689	113689	she	2394	“ For we must attribute this happy conclusion , ”
113692	113716	113689	113689	she	2394	“ in a great measure to his kindness . We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money . ”
113717	113720	113722	113723	her mother	225	“ Well , ”
113725	113869	113722	113723	her mother	225	“ it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents . Well ! I am so happy . In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . Mrs. Wickham ! How well it sounds ! And she was only sixteen last June . My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I ca n’t write ; so I will dictate , and you write for me . We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . ”
113957	113964	113966	113966	she	119	“ I will go to Meryton , ”
113968	114080	113966	113966	she	119	“ as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long . Kitty , run down and order the carriage . An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . Girls , can I do anything for you in Meryton ? Oh ! here comes Hill . My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding . ”
115092	115098	115100	115100	she	85	“ Haye Park might do , ”
115102	115155	115100	115100	she	85	“ if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off . I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful . ”
115181	115239	115176	115176	he	239	“ Mrs. Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . Into _ one _ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance . I will not encourage the imprudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . ”
116016	116028	116029	116029	he	149	“ It was greatly my wish that he should do so , ”
116032	116329	116029	116029	he	149	“ as soon as his marriage was fixed on . And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ’s . It is Mr. Wickham ’s intention to go into the Regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . He has the promise of an ensigncy in General---- ’s regiment , now quartered in the north . It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . He promises fairly ; and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself . And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information ? He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south . She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--Yours , etc .
116330	116334	116361	116362	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ E. GARDINER . ”
116443	116452	116454	116454	she	83	“ She is so fond of Mrs. Forster , ”
116456	116496	116454	116454	she	83	“ it will be quite shocking to send her away ! And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . The officers may not be so pleasant in General---- ’s regiment . ”
117266	117275	117276	117276	she	83	“ Only think of its being three months , ”
117279	117344	117276	117276	she	83	“ since I went away : it seems but a fortnight , I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . Good gracious ! when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . ”
117381	117468	117363	117363	she	83	“ Oh , mamma , do the people hereabouts know I am married to - day ? I was afraid they might not ; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like anything . ”
117536	117560	117530	117530	her	83	“ Ah , Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . ”
117613	117616	117611	117611	herself	83	“ Mrs. Wickham ”
117647	117652	117654	117654	she	83	“ Well , mamma , ”
117667	117734	117654	117654	she	83	“ and what do you think of my husband ? Is not he a charming man ? I am sure my sisters must all envy me . I only hope they may have half my good luck . They must all go to Brighton . That is the place to get husbands . What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go ! ”
117735	117772	117852	117853	her mother	225	“ Very true ; and if I had my will we should . But , my dear Lydia , I do n’t at all like your going such a way off . Must it be so ? ”
117773	117841	117654	117654	she	83	“ Oh , Lord ! yes ; there is nothing in that . I shall like it of all things . You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . ”
117842	117850	117852	117853	her mother	225	“ I should like it beyond anything ! ”
117855	117891	117654	117654	she	83	“ And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . ”
117892	117903	117905	117905	Elizabeth	82	“ I thank you for my share of the favour , ”
117907	117920	117905	117905	Elizabeth	82	“ but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . ”
118218	118265	118214	118214	she	82	“ Lizzy , I never gave _ you _ an account of my wedding , I believe . You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? ”
118266	118271	118273	118273	Elizabeth	82	“ No , really , ”
118275	118289	118273	118273	Elizabeth	82	“ I think there can not be too little said on the subject . ”
118290	118364	118214	118214	she	82	“ La ! You are so strange ! But I must tell you how it went off . We were married , you know , at St. Clement ’s , because Wickham ’s lodgings were in that parish . And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o’clock . My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .
118365	118471	118273	118273	Elizabeth	82	“ Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss ! I was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .
118472	118570	118214	118214	she	82	“ Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual : I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . If you ’ll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . Not one party , or scheme , or anything ! To be sure , London was rather thin , but , however , the Little Theatre was open .
118571	118711	118273	118273	Elizabeth	82	“ Well , and so , just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone . And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day . But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes ’ time , and then we all set out . However , I recollected afterwards , that if he _ had _ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr. Darcy might have done as well . ”
118712	118716	118718	118718	Elizabeth	82	“ Mr. Darcy ! ”
118724	118779	118273	118273	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh , yes ! he was to come there with Wickham , you know . But , gracious me ! I quite forgot ! I ought not to have said a word about it . I promised them so faithfully ! What will Wickham say ? It was to be such a secret ! ”
118780	118789	118791	118791	Jane	119	“ If it was to be a secret , ”
118793	118811	118791	118791	Jane	119	“ say not another word on the subject . You may depend upon my seeking no further . ”
118812	118817	118819	118819	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh , certainly , ”
118826	118834	118819	118819	Elizabeth	82	“ we will ask you no questions . ”
118835	118839	118841	118841	Lydia	83	“ Thank you , ”
118843	118864	118841	118841	Lydia	83	“ for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be so angry . ”
119033	119039	119040	119040	she	82	“ You may readily comprehend , ”
119043	119123	119040	119040	she	82	“ what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and , comparatively speaking , a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . Pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . ”
119124	119134	119135	119135	she	82	“ Not that I _ shall _ , though , ”
119146	119178	119141	119141	she	82	“ and , my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . ”
119304	119314	121444	121445	Mr. Darcy	89	“ Gracechurch Street , _ Sept. 6 _ . * /
119315	119319	121444	121445	Mr. Darcy	89	“ My dear Niece ,
119320	121391	121444	121445	Mr. Darcy	89	“ I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a _ little _ writing will not comprise what I have to tell you . I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from _ you _ . Do n’t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _ your _ side . If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . Your uncle is as much surprised as I am ; and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done . But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . Mr. Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _ yours _ seems to have been . He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both -- Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham ’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him . He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world . His character was to speak for itself . He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself . If he _ had another _ motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . He had been some days in town before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs. Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . She then took a large house in Edward Street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . This Mrs. Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . Wickham , indeed , had gone to her on their first arrival in London ; and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction . They were in ---- Street . He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia . His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance as far as it would go . But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . She cared for none of her friends ; she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving Wickham . She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt had never been _ his _ design . He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of Lydia ’s flight on her own folly alone . He meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once . Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . Wickham , of course , wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . Everything being settled between _ them _ , Mr. Darcy ’s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch Street the evening before I came home . But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen ; and Mr. Darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former . He did not leave his name , and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . On Saturday he came again . Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . They met again on Sunday , and then _ I _ saw him too . It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . But our visitor was very obstinate . I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all . He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but _ this _ is the true one . Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . But , Lizzy , this must go no further than yourself , or Jane at most . You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _ her _ , and his commission purchased . The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . It was owing to him , to his reserve and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ’s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . Perhaps there was some truth in _ this _ ; though I doubt whether _ his _ reserve , or _ anybody ’s _ reserve can be answerable for the event . But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _ another interest _ in the affair . When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . I believe I have now told you everything . It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . Lydia came to us , and Wickham had constant admission to the house . _ He _ was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _ her _ behaviour while she stayed with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ’s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain . I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . I was sometimes quite provoked ; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return , and , as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him ? His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _ that _ , if he marry _ prudently _ , his wife may teach him . I thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . But slyness seems the fashion . Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . A low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing . But I must write no more . The children have been wanting me this half hour .
121392	121397	121444	121445	Mr. Darcy	89	“ Yours , very sincerely ,
121398	121402	121444	121445	Mr. Darcy	89	“ M. GARDINER . ”
121969	121983	121985	121985	he	133	“ I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? ”
121992	121997	121998	121998	she	82	“ You certainly do , ”
122004	122017	121998	121998	she	82	“ but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . ”
122018	122044	121988	121988	he	133	“ I should be sorry , indeed , if it were . _ We _ were always good friends , and now we are better . ”
122045	122054	121998	121998	she	82	“ True . Are the others coming out ? ”
122055	122096	121988	121988	he	133	“ I do not know . Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . And so , my dear sister , I find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . ”
122103	122168	121988	121988	he	133	“ I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . But of course she did not mention my name to you . ”
122169	122175	121988	121988	he	133	“ Yes , she did . ”
122176	122183	121988	121988	he	133	“ And what did she say ? ”
122184	122221	121988	121988	he	133	“ That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had -- not turned out well . At such a distance as _ that _ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . ”
122222	122225	122226	122226	he	2560	“ Certainly , ”
122245	122273	121988	121988	he	133	“ I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . We passed each other several times . I wonder what he can be doing there . ”
122274	122285	122287	122287	Elizabeth	82	“ Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , ”
122289	122305	122287	122287	Elizabeth	82	“ It must be something particular to take him there at this time of year . ”
122306	122330	121988	121988	he	133	“ Undoubtedly . Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . ”
122331	122341	122287	122287	Elizabeth	82	“ Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . ”
122342	122349	121988	121988	he	133	“ And do you like her ? ”
122350	122354	122287	122287	Elizabeth	82	“ Very much . ”
122355	122401	121988	121988	he	133	“ I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . When I last saw her , she was not very promising . I am very glad you liked her . I hope she will turn out well . ”
122402	122418	122287	122287	Elizabeth	82	“ I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . ”
122419	122429	121988	121988	he	133	“ Did you go by the village of Kympton ? ”
122430	122439	122287	122287	Elizabeth	82	“ I do not recollect that we did . ”
122440	122475	121988	121988	he	133	“ I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had . A most delightful place ! Excellent parsonage - house ! It would have suited me in every respect . ”
122476	122485	122287	122287	Elizabeth	82	“ How should you have liked making sermons ? ”
122486	122572	121988	121988	he	133	“ Exceedingly well . I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . One ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! But it was not to be . Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance when you were in Kent ? ”
122573	122607	122287	122287	Elizabeth	82	“ I _ have _ heard from authority , which I thought _ as good _ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . ”
122608	122634	121988	121988	he	133	“ You have ! Yes , there was something in _ that _ ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . ”
122635	122687	122287	122287	Elizabeth	82	“ I _ did _ hear , too , that there was a time when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . ”
122688	122718	121988	121988	he	133	“ You did ! and it was not wholly without foundation . You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . ”
122766	122803	122754	122754	she	2563	“ Come , Mr. Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . Do not let us quarrel about the past . In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . ”
122931	122938	122939	122939	she	85	“ Oh , my dear Lydia , ”
122942	122949	122939	122939	she	85	“ when shall we meet again ? ”
122950	122969	123027	123027	his	133	“ Oh , Lord ! I do n’t know . Not these two or three years , perhaps . ”
122970	122980	122939	122939	she	85	“ Write to me very often , my dear . ”
122981	123017	123027	123027	his	133	“ As often as I can . But you know married women have never much time for writing . My sisters may write to _ me _ . They will have nothing else to do . ”
123043	123051	123053	123054	Mr. Bennet	74	“ He is as fine a fellow , ”
123066	123110	123053	123054	Mr. Bennet	74	“ as ever I saw . He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . I am prodigiously proud of him . I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son - in - law . ”
123125	123130	123132	123132	she	215	“ I often think , ”
123134	123155	123132	123132	she	215	“ that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ’s friends . One seems so forlorn without them . ”
123156	123172	123174	123174	Elizabeth	82	“ This is the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , ”
123176	123190	123174	123174	Elizabeth	82	“ It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . ”
123191	123236	123132	123132	she	215	“ It is no such thing . Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband ’s regiment happens to be so far off . If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . ”
123332	123347	123316	123316	She	85	“ Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , ”
123359	123459	123316	123316	She	85	“ Well , so much the better . Not that I care about it , though . He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . And who knows what _ may _ happen ? But that is nothing to us . You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . And so , it is quite certain he is coming ? ”
123460	123467	123469	123470	the other	3332	“ You may depend on it , ”
123472	123562	123469	123470	the other	3332	“ for Mrs. Nichols was in Meryton last night : I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certainly true . He comes down on Thursday , at the latest , very likely on Wednesday . She was going to the butcher ’s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed . ”
123604	123721	123602	123602	she	83	“ I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed ; but do n’t imagine it was from any silly cause . I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I _ should _ be looked at . I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . Not that I am afraid of _ myself _ , but I dread other people ’s remarks . ”
123796	123802	123803	123803	she	82	“ Yet it is hard , ”
123807	123840	123803	123803	she	82	“ that this poor man can not come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! I _ will _ leave him to himself . ”
123914	123926	123928	123929	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes , my dear , ”
123931	123941	123928	123929	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ you will wait on him , of course . ”
123942	123993	123994	123994	His	2586	“ No , no . You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool ’s errand again . ”
124019	124029	124031	124031	he	2586	“ ’ Tis an _ etiquette _ I despise , ”
124033	124074	124031	124031	he	2586	“ If he wants our society , let him seek it . He knows where we live . I will not spend _ my _ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again . ”
124075	124144	124150	124150	she	2589	“ Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . But , however , that sha n’t prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon . That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . ”
124197	124209	124211	124211	Jane	119	“ I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , ”
124216	124280	124211	124211	Jane	119	“ It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference ; but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much I suffer from what she says . Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over ! ”
124281	124292	124294	124294	Elizabeth	82	“ I wish I could say anything to comfort you , ”
124296	124332	124294	124294	Elizabeth	82	“ but it is wholly out of my power . You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . ”
124473	124483	124485	124485	Kitty	86	“ There is a gentleman with him , mamma , ”
124487	124493	124485	124485	Kitty	86	“ who can it be ? ”
124494	124514	124458	124458	she	82	“ Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . ”
124515	124518	124520	124520	Kitty	86	“ La ! ”
124522	124549	124520	124520	Kitty	86	“ it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . Mr. what ’s his name -- that tall , proud man . ”
124550	124595	124596	124596	Jane	119	“ Good gracious ! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does , I vow . Well , any friend of Mr. Bingley ’s will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . ”
124904	124913	124915	124915	she	119	“ Let me first see how he behaves , ”
124917	124927	124915	124915	she	119	“ it will then be early enough for expectation . ”
125370	125379	125381	125381	she	82	“ Could I expect it to be otherwise ? ”
125383	125390	125381	125381	she	82	“ Yet why did he come ? ”
125425	125440	125442	125443	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ It is a long time , Mr. Bingley , since you went away , ”
125451	125637	125445	125445	He	89	“ I began to be afraid you would never come back again . People _ did _ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away . Miss Lucas is married and settled : and one of my own daughters . I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . It was in the ‘ Times ’ and the ‘ Courier , ’ I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . It was only said , ‘ Lately , George Wickham , Esq . , to Miss Lydia Bennet , ’ without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything . It was my brother Gardiner ’s drawing up , too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . Did you see it ? ”
125669	125687	125689	125690	her mother	225	“ It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , ”
125692	125789	125689	125690	her mother	225	“ but at the same time , Mr. Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken away from me . They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long . His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire , and of his being gone into the Regulars . Thank heaven ! he has _ some _ friends , though , perhaps , not so many as he deserves . ”
125861	125874	125876	125877	her mother	225	“ When you have killed all your own birds , Mr. Bingley , ”
125879	125923	125876	125877	her mother	225	“ I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet ’s manor . I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the coveys for you . ”
125993	126001	126003	126003	she	82	“ The first wish of my heart , ”
126007	126046	126003	126003	she	82	“ is never more to be in company with either of them . Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! Let me never see either one or the other again ! ”
126219	126232	126233	126233	she	85	“ You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr. Bingley , ”
126236	126289	126233	126233	she	85	“ for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned . I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . ”
126430	126446	126448	126448	she	82	“ Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , ”
126450	126457	126448	126448	she	82	“ did he come at all ? ”
126470	126530	126531	126531	Her	82	“ He could be still amiable , still pleasing to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? If he fears me , why come hither ? If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? Teasing , teasing man ! I will think no more about him . ”
126565	126568	126570	126570	she	308	“ Now , ”
126572	126631	126570	126570	she	308	“ that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . I am glad he dines here on Tuesday . It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . ”
126632	126640	126642	126642	Elizabeth	82	“ Yes , very indifferent , indeed , ”
126646	126654	126642	126642	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh , Jane ! take care . ”
126655	126674	126570	126570	she	308	“ My dear Lizzy , you can not think me so weak as to be in danger now . ”
126675	126696	126642	126642	Elizabeth	82	“ I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . ”
127238	127251	127253	127253	she	82	“ If he does not come to me , _ then _ , ”
127255	127264	127253	127253	she	82	“ I shall give him up for ever . ”
127355	127378	127338	127341	one of the girls	2662	“ The men sha n’t come and part us , I am determined . We want none of them ; do we ? ”
127425	127482	127419	127419	herself	82	“ A man who has once been refused ! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? Is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings . ”
127508	127516	127502	127502	she	82	“ Is your sister at Pemberley still ? ”
127517	127527	127502	127502	she	82	“ Yes ; she will remain there till Christmas . ”
127528	127540	127502	127502	she	82	“ And quite alone ? Have all her friends left her ? ”
127541	127560	127502	127502	she	82	“ Mrs. Annesley is with her . The others have been gone on to Scarborough these three weeks . ”
127770	127775	127777	127777	she	82	“ Well , girls , ”
127788	127978	127777	127777	she	82	“ what say you to the day ? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . The venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch . The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases ’ last week ; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least . And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . Mrs. Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . And what do you think she said besides ? ‘ Ah ! Mrs. Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last ! ’ She did , indeed . I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . ”
128053	128062	128064	128065	Miss Bennet	83	“ It has been a very agreeable day , ”
128069	128092	128064	128065	Miss Bennet	83	“ The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . I hope we may often meet again . ”
128096	128190	128093	128093	Elizabeth	82	“ Lizzy , you must not do so . You must not suspect me . It mortifies me . I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it . I am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . ”
128191	128197	128199	128200	her sister	308	“ You are very cruel , ”
128202	128219	128199	128200	her sister	308	“ you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . ”
128220	128254	128093	128093	Elizabeth	82	“ How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! And how impossible in others ! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? ”
128255	128304	128199	128200	her sister	308	“ That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _ me _ your confidante . ”
128382	128388	128390	128390	she	85	“ Next time you call , ”
128392	128401	128390	128390	she	85	“ I hope we shall be more lucky . ”
128435	128443	128458	128458	her	85	“ Can you come to - morrow ? ”
128509	128566	128486	128487	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . He is come -- Mr. Bingley is come . He is , indeed . Make haste , make haste . Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . Never mind Miss Lizzy ’s hair . ”
128567	128578	128580	128580	Jane	119	“ We will be down as soon as we can , ”
128582	128604	128580	128580	Jane	119	“ but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went upstairs half an hour ago . ”
128605	128635	128638	128638	her	119	“ Oh ! hang Kitty ! what has she to do with it ? Come , be quick , be quick ! where is your sash , my dear ? ”
128745	128768	128740	128740	she	86	“ What is the matter , mamma ? What do you keep winking at me for ? What am I to do ? ”
128769	128783	128784	128784	She	82	“ Nothing , child , nothing . I did not wink at you . ”
128810	128824	128801	128801	she	82	“ Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , ”
128875	128888	128866	128867	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . ”
128895	128908	128910	128911	her mother	225	“ We may as well leave them by themselves , you know , ”
128921	128936	128910	128911	her mother	225	“ Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room . ”
129501	129507	129508	129508	she	82	“ ’ Tis too much ! ”
129511	129532	129508	129508	she	82	“ by far too much . I do not deserve it . Oh , why is not everybody as happy ? ”
129593	129602	129603	129603	she	82	“ I must go instantly to my mother , ”
129606	129668	129603	129603	she	82	“ I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude , or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself . He is gone to my father already . Oh , Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall I bear so much happiness ? ”
129730	129734	129736	129736	she	82	“ And this , ”
129738	129769	129736	129736	she	82	“ is the end of all his friend ’s anxious circumspection ! of all his sister ’s falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , and most reasonable end ! ”
129793	129799	129801	129801	he	79	“ Where is your sister ? ”
129810	129828	129829	129829	He	79	“ With my mother upstairs . She will be down in a moment , I dare say . ”
130100	130115	130093	130093	he	74	“ Jane , I congratulate you . You will be a very happy woman . ”
130132	130139	130140	130140	he	74	“ You are a good girl , ”
130143	130216	130140	130140	he	74	“ and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . Your tempers are by no means unlike . You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . ”
130217	130237	130250	130251	his wife	215	“ I hope not so . Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _ me _ . ”
130238	130248	130250	130251	his wife	215	“ Exceed their income ! My dear Mr. Bennet , ”
130253	130276	130250	130251	his wife	215	“ what are you talking of ? Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . ”
130282	130385	130250	130251	his wife	215	“ Oh , my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! I am sure I sha n’t get a wink of sleep all night . I knew how it would be . I always said it must be so , at last . I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . Oh , he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! ”
130598	130606	130608	130608	she	119	“ He has made me so happy , ”
130613	130637	130608	130608	she	119	“ by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! I had not believed it possible . ”
130638	130644	130646	130646	Elizabeth	82	“ I suspected as much , ”
130648	130657	130608	130608	she	119	“ But how did he account for it ? ”
130658	130747	130608	130608	she	119	“ It must have been his sisters ’ doing . They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I can not wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again : though we can never be what we once were to each other . ”
130748	130756	130758	130758	Elizabeth	82	“ That is the most unforgiving speech , ”
130760	130791	130758	130758	Elizabeth	82	“ that I ever heard you utter . Good girl ! It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley ’s pretended regard . ”
130792	130832	130608	130608	she	119	“ Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ? ”
130833	130854	130758	130758	Elizabeth	82	“ He made a little mistake , to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . ”
130922	130934	130936	130936	Jane	119	“ I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! ”
130938	130977	130936	130936	Jane	119	“ Oh , Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ? If I could but see you as happy ! If there were but such another man for you ! ”
130978	131044	131060	131061	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you . Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . No , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time . ”
131460	131480	131452	131452	she	85	“ I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . That lady , I suppose , is your mother ? ”
131489	131504	131452	131452	she	85	“ And _ that _ , I suppose , is one of your sisters ? ”
131505	131510	131512	131513	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Yes , madam , ”
131523	131569	131512	131513	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ She is my youngest girl but one . My youngest of all is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the ground , walking with a young man , who , I believe , will soon become a part of the family . ”
131570	131579	131581	131582	Lady Catherine	86	“ You have a very small park here , ”
131589	131621	131645	131646	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my Lady , I dare say ; but , I assure you , it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ’s . ”
131622	131644	131645	131646	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ This must be a most inconvenient sitting - room for the evening in summer : the windows are full west . ”
131660	131679	131645	131646	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well ? ”
131680	131694	131645	131646	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Yes , very well . I saw them the night before last . ”
131770	131812	131769	131769	Elizabeth,--	156	“ Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . ”
131813	131819	131821	131822	her mother	225	“ Go , my dear , ”
131824	131844	131821	131822	her mother	225	“ and show her Ladyship about the different walks . I think she will be pleased with the hermitage . ”
131961	131972	131974	131974	she	82	“ How could I ever think her like her nephew ? ”
131998	132033	131991	131992	Lady Catherine	86	“ You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . ”
132040	132066	131991	131992	Lady Catherine	86	“ Indeed , you are mistaken , madam ; I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . ”
132067	132071	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ Miss Bennet , ”
132081	132254	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ you ought to know that I am not to be trifled with . But however insincere _ you _ may choose to be , you shall not find _ me _ so . My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness ; and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago . I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that _ you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew -- my own nephew , Mr. Darcy . Though I _ know _ it must be a scandalous falsehood , though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . ”
132255	132265	132267	132267	Elizabeth	82	“ If you believed it impossible to be true , ”
132275	132295	132267	132267	Elizabeth	82	“ I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . What could your Ladyship propose by it ? ”
132296	132309	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . ”
132310	132323	132325	132325	Elizabeth	82	“ Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , ”
132328	132348	132325	132325	Elizabeth	82	“ will be rather a confirmation of it -- if , indeed , such a report is in existence . ”
132349	132383	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ If ! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? ”
132384	132392	132325	132325	Elizabeth	82	“ I never heard that it was . ”
132393	132410	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ And can you likewise declare , that there is no _ foundation _ for it ? ”
132411	132440	132325	132325	Elizabeth	82	“ I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship . _ You _ may ask questions which _ I _ shall not choose to answer . ”
132441	132472	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ This is not to be borne . Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? ”
132473	132483	132325	132325	Elizabeth	82	“ Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible . ”
132484	132542	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason . But _ your _ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . You may have drawn him in . ”
132543	132558	132325	132325	Elizabeth	82	“ If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . ”
132559	132603	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? I have not been accustomed to such language as this . I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . ”
132604	132629	132325	132325	Elizabeth	82	“ But you are not entitled to know _ mine _ ; nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit . ”
132630	132676	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ Let me be rightly understood . This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place . No , never . Mr. Darcy is engaged to _ my daughter _ . Now , what have you to say ? ”
132677	132700	132325	132325	Elizabeth	82	“ Only this,--that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . ”
132711	132855	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . It was the favourite wish of _ his _ mother , as well as of hers . While in their cradles we planned the union ; and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends -- to his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh ? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? ”
132856	132964	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ Yes ; and I had heard it before . But what is that to me ? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh . You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage . Its completion depended on others . If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? ”
132965	133045	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ Because honour , decorum , prudence -- nay , interest -- forbid it . Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him . Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . ”
133046	133052	133054	133054	Elizabeth	82	“ These are heavy misfortunes , ”
133056	133090	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . ”
133091	133182	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ Obstinate , headstrong girl ! I am ashamed of you ! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? Is nothing due to me on that score ? Let us sit down . You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be dissuaded from it . I have not been used to submit to any person ’s whims . I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . ”
133183	133209	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ _ That _ will make your Ladyship ’s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _ me _ . ”
133210	133353	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ I will not be interrupted ! Hear me in silence . My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . They are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ’s , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled , families . Their fortune on both sides is splendid . They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune ! Is this to be endured ? But it must not , shall not be ! If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . ”
133354	133388	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ’s daughter ; so far we are equal . ”
133389	133423	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ True . You _ are _ a gentleman ’s daughter . But what was your mother ? Who are your uncles and aunts ? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . ”
133424	133431	133433	133433	Elizabeth	82	“ Whatever my connections may be , ”
133435	133454	133433	133433	Elizabeth	82	“ if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _ you _ . ”
133455	133469	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ Tell me , once for all , are you engaged to him ? ”
133500	133505	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ I am not . ”
133511	133525	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement ? ”
133526	133536	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ I will make no promise of the kind . ”
133537	133586	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ Miss Bennet , I am shocked and astonished . I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede . I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require . ”
133587	133766	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ And I certainly _ never _ shall give it . I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable . Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise make _ their _ marriage at all more probable ? Supposing him to be attached to me , would _ my _ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged . You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these . How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _ his _ affairs , I can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no further on the subject . ”
133767	133895	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ Not so hasty , if you please . I have by no means done . To all the objections I have already urged I have still another to add . I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ’s infamous elopement . I know it all ; that the young man ’s marrying her was a patched - up business , at the expense of your father and uncle . And is _ such _ a girl to be my nephew ’s sister ? Is _ her _ husband , who is the son of his late father ’s steward , to be his brother ? Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking ? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ? ”
133896	133908	133909	133909	she	2785	“ You can _ now _ have nothing further to say , ”
133913	133933	133909	133909	she	2785	“ You have insulted me , in every possible method . I must beg to return to the house . ”
133957	133997	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! Unfeeling , selfish girl ! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? ”
133998	134014	133941	133942	Lady Catherine	86	“ Lady Catherine , I have nothing further to say . You know my sentiments . ”
134015	134024	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ You are then resolved to have him ? ”
134025	134072	133941	133942	Lady Catherine	86	“ I have said no such thing . I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to _ you _ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . ”
134073	134124	132073	132074	her Ladyship	3398	“ It is well . You refuse , then , to oblige me . You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . ”
134125	134135	134137	134137	Elizabeth	82	“ Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , ”
134139	134221	134137	134137	Elizabeth	82	“ has any possible claim on me , in the present instance . No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy . And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _ were _ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ’s concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . ”
134222	134285	134309	134309	she	86	“ And this is your real opinion ! This is your final resolve ! Very well . I shall now know how to act . Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . I came to try you . I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . ”
134311	134342	134309	134309	she	86	“ I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . I send no compliments to your mother . You deserve no such attention . I am most seriously displeased . ”
134406	134413	134415	134416	her daughter	446	“ She did not choose it , ”
134418	134423	134415	134416	her daughter	446	“ she would go . ”
134424	134498	134415	134416	her daughter	446	“ She is a very fine - looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . She is on her road somewhere , I dare say ; and so , passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? ”
135010	135032	135033	135033	she	82	“ If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , ”
135036	135088	135033	135033	she	82	“ I shall know how to understand it . I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . ”
135171	135174	135176	135176	he	228	“ Lizzy , ”
135178	135192	135176	135176	he	228	“ I was going to look for you : come into my room . ”
135266	135321	135263	135263	He	228	“ I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . I did not know before that I had _ two _ daughters on the brink of matrimony . Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . ”
135380	135422	135377	135378	her father	228	“ You look conscious . Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even _ your _ sagacity to discover the name of your admirer . This letter is from Mr. Collins . ”
135423	135438	135349	135349	she	82	“ From Mr. Collins ! and what can _ he _ have to say ? ”
135439	135834	135377	135378	her father	228	“ Something very much to the purpose , of course . He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good - natured , gossiping Lucases . I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point . What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another , of which we have been advertised by the same authority . Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her eldest sister has resigned it ; and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . ’ Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? ‘ This young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with everything the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . Yet , in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman ’s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ’ Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? But now it comes out . ‘ My motive for cautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt , Lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ’ _ Mr. Darcy _ , you see , is the man ! Now , Lizzy , I think I _ have _ surprised you . Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? Mr. Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _ you _ in his life ! It is admirable ! ”
135869	135875	135349	135349	she	82	“ Are you not diverted ? ”
135876	135885	135349	135349	she	82	“ Oh , yes . Pray read on . ”
135886	136230	135349	135349	she	82	“ ‘ After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that , on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . ’ Mr. Collins , moreover , adds , ‘ I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ’s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known . I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . You ought certainly to forgive them as a Christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . ’ _ That _ is his notion of Christian forgiveness ! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ’s situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch . But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . You are not going to be _ missish _ , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? ”
136231	136234	136236	136236	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh , ”
136238	136250	136236	136236	Elizabeth	82	“ I am exceedingly diverted . But it is so strange ! ”
136251	136372	135349	135349	she	82	“ Yes , _ that _ is what makes it amusing . Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference and _ your _ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd ! Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr. Collins ’s correspondence for any consideration . Nay , when I read a letter of his , I can not help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law . And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? Did she call to refuse her consent ? ”
136738	136827	136735	136735	she	86	“ Mr. Darcy , I am a very selfish creature , and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours . I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . Were it known to the rest of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . ”
136828	136836	136838	136838	Darcy	89	“ I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , ”
136848	136882	136838	136838	Darcy	89	“ that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted . ”
136883	136964	136735	136735	she	86	“ You must not blame my aunt . Lydia ’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ”
136965	136974	136975	136975	he	89	“ If you _ will _ thank me , ”
136978	137038	136975	136975	he	89	“ let it be for yourself alone . That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . But your _ family _ owe me nothing . Much as I respect them , I believe I thought only of _ you _ . ”
137058	137108	137054	137055	her companion	1659	“ You are too generous to trifle with me . If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once . _ My _ affections and wishes are unchanged ; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . ”
137422	137429	137431	137431	he	1659	“ It taught me to hope , ”
137433	137478	137431	137431	he	1659	“ as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly . ”
137487	137529	137479	137479	Elizabeth	82	“ Yes , you know enough of my _ frankness _ to believe me capable of _ that _ . After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . ”
137530	137583	137431	137431	he	1659	“ What did you say of me that I did not deserve ? For though your accusations were ill - founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof . It was unpardonable . I can not think of it without abhorrence . ”
137584	137600	137602	137602	Elizabeth	82	“ We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , ”
137604	137632	137602	137602	Elizabeth	82	“ The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then we have both , I hope , improved in civility . ”
137633	137743	137431	137431	he	1659	“ I can not be so easily reconciled to myself . The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me . Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : ‘ Had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ’ Those were your words . You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . ”
137744	137776	137602	137602	Elizabeth	82	“ I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . ”
137777	137832	137431	137431	he	1659	“ I can easily believe it . You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me . ”
137833	137866	137602	137602	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh , do not repeat what I then said . These recollections will not do at all . I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . ”
137872	137876	137867	137867	Darcy	89	“ Did it , ”
137878	137904	137905	137905	She	2838	he,--“did it _ soon _ make you think better of me ? Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? ”
137926	137930	137932	137932	he	89	“ I knew , ”
137934	137993	137932	137932	he	89	“ that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . I hope you have destroyed the letter . There was one part , especially the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . ”
137994	138044	137867	137867	Darcy	89	“ The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . ”
138045	138052	138054	138054	Darcy	89	“ When I wrote that letter , ”
138056	138081	138054	138054	Darcy	89	“ I believed myself perfectly calm and cool ; but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . ”
138082	138168	137867	137867	Darcy	89	“ The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . The adieu is charity itself . But think no more of the letter . The feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten . You must learn some of my philosophy . Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . ”
138169	138481	138054	138054	Darcy	89	“ I can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . _ Your _ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of ignorance . But with _ me _ , it is not so . Painful recollections will intrude , which can not , which ought not to be repelled . I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . As a child I was taught what was _ right _ , but I was not taught to correct my temper . I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . Unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only _ child _ ) , I was spoiled by my parents , who , though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _ wish _ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . Such I was , from eight to eight - and - twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth ! What do I not owe you ! You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . By you , I was properly humbled . I came to you without a doubt of my reception . You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . ”
138482	138492	138762	138762	He	89	“ Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? ”
138493	138517	138054	138054	Darcy	89	“ Indeed I had . What will you think of my vanity ? I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . ”
138518	138563	138762	138762	He	89	“ My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , I assure you . I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . How you must have hated me after _ that _ evening ! ”
138564	138588	138054	138054	Darcy	89	“ Hate you ! I was angry , perhaps , at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . ”
138589	138613	138762	138762	He	89	“ I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley . You blamed me for coming ? ”
138614	138625	138054	138054	Darcy	89	“ No , indeed , I felt nothing but surprise . ”
138626	138671	138762	138762	He	89	“ Your surprise could not be greater than _ mine _ in being noticed by you . My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive _ more _ than my due . ”
138672	138679	138681	138681	Darcy	89	“ My object _ then _ , ”
138683	138761	138681	138681	Darcy	89	“ was to show you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . How soon any other wishes introduced themselves , I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . ”
138897	138908	138922	138922	Darcy	147	“ What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane ? ”
138940	138949	138951	138951	Elizabeth	82	“ I must ask whether you were surprised ? ”
138953	138971	138951	138951	Elizabeth	82	“ Not at all . When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . ”
138972	138989	138992	138992	he	89	“ That is to say , you had given your permission . I guessed as much . ”
139009	139019	139021	139021	he	89	“ On the evening before my going to London , ”
139023	139125	139021	139021	he	89	“ I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent . His surprise was great . He had never had the slightest suspicion . I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . ”
139140	139149	139151	139151	she	82	“ Did you speak from your own observation , ”
139153	139172	139151	139151	she	82	“ when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? ”
139173	139204	139132	139132	his	2845	“ From the former . I had narrowly observed her , during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . ”
139205	139221	139151	139151	she	82	“ And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . ”
139222	139343	139132	139132	his	2845	“ It did . Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made everything easy . I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . He was angry . But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ’s sentiments . He has heartily forgiven me now . ”
139432	139445	139429	139430	CHAPTER LIX	127	“ My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? ”
139666	139700	139660	139660	she	82	“ You are joking , Lizzy . This can not be ! Engaged to Mr. Darcy ! No , no , you shall not deceive me : I know it to be impossible . ”
139701	139758	139660	139660	she	82	“ This is a wretched beginning , indeed ! My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . I speak nothing but the truth . He still loves me , and we are engaged . ”
139765	139783	139759	139759	Jane	119	“ Oh , Lizzy ! it can not be . I know how much you dislike him . ”
139784	139839	139660	139660	she	82	“ You know nothing of the matter . _ That _ is all to be forgot . Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now ; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable . This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . ”
139860	139877	139879	139879	Jane	119	“ Good heaven ! can it be really so ? Yet now I must believe you , ”
139881	139917	139879	139879	Jane	119	“ My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ”
139918	139961	139847	139847	Elizabeth	82	“ There can be no doubt of that . It is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . But are you pleased , Jane ? Shall you like to have such a brother ? ”
139962	140025	139879	139879	Jane	119	“ Very , very much . Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . And do you really love him quite well enough ? Oh , Lizzy ! do anything rather than marry without affection . Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? ”
140026	140051	139847	139847	Elizabeth	82	“ Oh , yes ! You will only think I feel _ more _ than I ought to do when I tell you all . ”
140052	140058	139879	139879	Jane	119	“ What do you mean ? ”
140059	140083	139847	139847	Elizabeth	82	“ Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley . I am afraid you will be angry . ”
140084	140127	139879	139879	Jane	119	“ My dearest sister , now be , _ be _ serious . I want to talk very seriously . Let me know everything that I am to know without delay . Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? ”
140128	140162	139847	139847	Elizabeth	82	“ It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began ; but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . ”
140204	140211	140213	140213	she	2860	“ Now I am quite happy , ”
140215	140317	140213	140213	she	2860	“ for you will be as happy as myself . I always had a value for him . Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley ’s friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . But , Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! I owe all that I know of it to another , not to you . ”
140382	140386	140388	140389	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ Good gracious ! ”
140401	140484	140392	140392	she	85	“ if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? I had no notion but he would go a - shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . What shall we do with him ? Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ’s way . ”
140548	140570	140542	140542	he	79	“ Mrs. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? ”
140571	140583	140585	140586	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , ”
140588	140613	140585	140586	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ to walk to Oakham Mount this morning . It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . ”
140614	140624	140626	140627	Mr. Bingley	79	“ It may do very well for the others , ”
140629	140648	140626	140627	Mr. Bingley	79	“ but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . Wo n’t it , Kitty ? ”
140691	140756	140685	140686	Mrs. Bennet	85	“ I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but I hope you will not mind it . It is all for Jane ’s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then ; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . ”
141029	141042	141043	141043	She	225	“ Go to your father ; he wants you in the library . ”
141061	141064	141066	141066	he	228	“ Lizzy , ”
141068	141093	141066	141066	he	228	“ what are you doing ? Are you out of your senses to be accepting this man ? Have not you always hated him ? ”
141153	141195	141138	141138	she	225	“ Or , in other words , you are determined to have him . He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . But will they make you happy ? ”
141196	141203	141205	141205	Elizabeth	82	“ Have you any other objection , ”
141207	141215	141205	141205	Elizabeth	82	“ than your belief of my indifference ? ”
141216	141246	141138	141138	she	225	“ None at all . We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . ”
141247	141256	141257	141257	she	82	“ I do , I do like him , ”
141266	141306	141257	141257	she	82	“ I love him . Indeed he has no improper pride . He is perfectly amiable . You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . ”
141307	141310	141312	141313	her father	228	“ Lizzy , ”
141315	141463	141312	141313	her father	228	“ I have given him my consent . He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask . I now give it to _ you _ , if you are resolved on having him . But let me advise you to think better of it . I know your disposition , Lizzy . I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband , unless you looked up to him as a superior . Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . My child , let me not have the grief of seeing _ you _ unable to respect your partner in life . You know not what you are about . ”
141560	141566	141568	141568	he	89	“ Well , my dear , ”
141575	141609	141568	141568	he	89	“ I have no more to say . If this be the case , he deserves you . I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to anyone less worthy . ”
141635	141749	141631	141631	her	82	“ This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! And so , Darcy did everything ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ’s debts , and got him his commission ! So much the better . It will save me a world of trouble and economy . Had it been your uncle ’s doing , I must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way . I shall offer to pay him to - morrow , he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . ”
141790	141812	141785	141785	she	82	“ If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . ”
142009	142160	141982	141982	She	82	“ Good gracious ! Lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! Mr. Darcy ! Who would have thought it ? And is it really true ? Oh , my sweetest Lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! What pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! Jane ’s is nothing to it -- nothing at all . I am so pleased -- so happy . Such a charming man ! so handsome ! so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before . I hope he will overlook it . Dear , dear Lizzy . A house in town ! Everything that is charming ! Three daughters married ! Ten thousand a year ! Oh , Lord ! what will become of me ? I shall go distracted . ”
142209	142214	142215	142215	she	225	“ My dearest child , ”
142218	142286	142215	142215	she	225	“ I can think of nothing else . Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! ’ Tis as good as a lord ! And a special licence -- you must and shall be married by a special licence . But , my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . ”
142426	142439	142441	142441	he	265	“ I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , ”
142443	142469	142441	142441	he	265	“ Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like _ your _ husband quite as well as Jane ’s . ”
142498	142504	142506	142506	she	82	“ How could you begin ? ”
142508	142536	142506	142506	she	82	“ I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? ”
142537	142584	142482	142482	she	82	“ I can not fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . It is too long ago . I was in the middle before I knew that I _ had _ begun . ”
142585	142643	142506	142506	she	82	“ My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to _ you _ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . Now , be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? ”
142644	142654	142482	142482	she	82	“ For the liveliness of your mind I did . ”
142655	142829	142506	142506	she	82	“ You may as well call it impertinence at once . It was very little less . The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for _ your _ approbation alone . I roused and interested you , because I was so unlike _ them _ . Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it : but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . There -- I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . To be sure you know no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of _ that _ when they fall in love . ”
142830	142849	142482	142482	she	82	“ Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? ”
142850	142975	142506	142506	she	82	“ Dearest Jane ! who could have done less for her ? But make a virtue of it by all means . My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly , by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last ? What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? ”
142976	142990	142482	142482	she	82	“ Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . ”
142991	142997	142506	142506	she	82	“ But I was embarrassed . ”
142998	143003	142482	142482	she	82	“ And so was I. ”
143004	143018	142506	142506	she	82	“ You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . ”
143019	143028	142482	142482	she	82	“ A man who had felt less might . ”
143029	143147	142506	142506	she	82	“ How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! But I wonder how long you _ would _ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . I wonder when you _ would _ have spoken if I had not asked you ! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . _ Too much _ , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? This will never do . ”
143148	143229	142482	142482	she	82	“ You need not distress yourself . The moral will be perfectly fair . Lady Catherine ’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . I was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours . My aunt ’s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know everything . ”
143230	143287	142506	142506	she	82	“ Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequences ? ”
143288	143358	142482	142482	she	82	“ My real purpose was to see _ you _ , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me . My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . ”
143359	143376	142506	142506	she	82	“ Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her ? ”
143377	143413	142482	142482	she	82	“ I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . But it ought to be done ; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly . ”
143414	143462	142506	142506	she	82	“ And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . ”
143531	143757	143760	143761	Mr. Darcy	89	“ I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write . You supposed more than really existed . But _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err . You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . I thank you again and again , for not going to the Lakes . How could I be so silly as to wish it ! Your idea of the ponies is delightful . We will go round the park every day . I am the happiest creature in the world . Perhaps other people have said so before , but no one with such justice . I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me . You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . Yours , ”
143795	143800	143760	143761	Mr. Darcy	89	“ Dear Sir , * /
143801	143849	143780	143781	Mr. Bennet	74	“ I must trouble you once more for congratulations . Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy . Console Lady Catherine as well as you can . But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . He has more to give .
143850	143854	143857	143858	Miss Bingley	91	“ Yours sincerely , ”
144936	144942	144902	144902	Lydia	83	“ My dear Lizzy , * /
144943	145060	145077	145077	she	82	“ I wish you joy . If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . It is a great comfort to have you so rich ; and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much ; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . Any place would do of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it , if you had rather not .
145061	145064	144902	144902	Lydia	83	“ Yours , ”
