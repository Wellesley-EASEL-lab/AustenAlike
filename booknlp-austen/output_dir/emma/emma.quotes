1279	1302	1273	1273	he	434	" Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again . What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her ! "
1303	1370	1273	1273	he	434	" I can not agree with you , papa ; you know I can not . Mr. Weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ? "
1371	1404	1273	1273	he	434	" A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own ? This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours , my dear . "
1405	1443	1273	1273	he	434	" How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us!--We shall be always meeting ! _ We _ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon . "
1444	1470	1273	1273	he	434	" My dear , how am I to get so far ? Randalls is such a distance . I could not walk half so far . "
1471	1493	1273	1273	he	434	" No , papa , nobody thought of your walking . We must go in the carriage , to be sure . "
1494	1527	1273	1273	he	434	" The carriage ! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ? "
1528	1631	1273	1273	he	434	" They are to be put into Mr. Weston 's stable , papa . You know we have settled all that already . We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night . And as for James , you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter 's being housemaid there . I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else . That was your doing , papa . You got Hannah that good place . Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her -- James is so obliged to you ! "
1632	1807	1273	1273	he	434	" I am very glad I did think of her . It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her . Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it . I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see . Whenever James goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us . He will be able to tell her how we all are . "

2030	2064	2025	2026	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" It is very kind of you , Mr. Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us . I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk . "
2065	2092	2025	2026	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Not at all , sir . It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire . "
2093	2113	2025	2026	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" But you must have found it very damp and dirty . I wish you may not catch cold . "
2114	2130	2025	2026	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Dirty , sir ! Look at my shoes . Not a speck on them . "
2131	2173	2025	2026	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Well ! that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here . It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast . I wanted them to put off the wedding . "
2174	2231	2025	2026	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" By the bye -- I have not wished you joy . Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well . How did you all behave ? Who cried most ? "
2232	2245	2025	2026	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Ah ! poor Miss Taylor ! ' Tis a sad business . "
2246	2306	2025	2026	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I can not possibly say ` poor Miss Taylor . ' I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two . "
2307	2324	2326	2326	Emma	128	" Especially when _ one _ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature ! "
2329	2355	2326	2326	Emma	128	" That is what you have in your head , I know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by . "
2356	2369	2371	2372	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed , "
2378	2390	2371	2372	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome . "
2391	2461	2462	2463	Mr. Knightley	97	" My dearest papa ! You do not think I could mean _ you _ , or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean _ you _ . What a horrible idea ! Oh no ! I meant only myself . Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know-- in a joke -- it is all a joke . We always say what we like to one another . "
2538	2546	2548	2549	Mr. Knightley	97	" Emma knows I never flatter her , "
2551	2590	2548	2549	Mr. Knightley	97	" but I meant no reflection on any body . Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one . The chances are that she must be a gainer . "
2591	2594	2596	2596	Emma	128	" Well , "
2602	2676	2548	2549	Mr. Knightley	97	pass--"you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly . Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen . Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day . "
2677	2686	2688	2689	her father	434	" Dear Emma bears every thing so well , "
2691	2724	2688	2689	her father	434	" But , Mr. Knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am sure she _ will _ miss her more than she thinks for . "
2737	2750	2752	2753	Mr. Knightley	97	" It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion , "
2755	2858	2752	2753	Mr. Knightley	97	" We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor 's advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor 's time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore can not allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married . "
2859	2871	2873	2873	Emma	128	" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me , "
2875	2934	2873	2873	Emma	128	" and a very considerable one -- that I made the match myself . I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing . "
2948	2982	2938	2938	his	97	" Ah ! my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass . Pray do not make any more matches . "
2983	3153	2943	2944	Her father	434	" I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people . It is the greatest amusement in the world ! And after such success , you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again . Oh dear , no ! Mr. Weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful-- Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it . Oh no ! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again . Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him . All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I believed none of it .
3154	3248	2938	2938	his	97	" Ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell 's , I made up my mind on the subject . I planned the match from that hour ; and when such success has blessed me in this instance , dear papa , you can not think that I shall leave off match - making . "
3249	3262	3264	3265	Mr. Knightley	97	" I do not understand what you mean by ` success , ' "
3267	3408	3264	3265	Mr. Knightley	97	" Success supposes endeavour . Your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage . A worthy employment for a young lady 's mind ! But if , which I rather imagine , your making the match , as you call it , means only your planning it , your saying to yourself one idle day , ` I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her , ' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards , why do you talk of success ? Where is your merit ? What are you proud of ? You made a lucky guess ; and _ that _ is all that can be said . "
3409	3555	2938	2938	his	97	" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?-- I pity you.--I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck . There is always some talent in it . And as to my poor word ` success , ' which you quarrel with , I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it . You have drawn two pretty pictures ; but I think there may be a third -- a something between the do - nothing and the do - all . If I had not promoted Mr. Weston 's visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all . I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that . "
3556	3606	3264	3265	Mr. Knightley	97	" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns . You are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference . "
3607	3622	3624	3625	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others , "
3632	3660	3624	3625	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" But , my dear , pray do not make any more matches ; they are silly things , and break up one 's family circle grievously . "
3661	3787	3264	3265	Mr. Knightley	97	" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr. Elton . Poor Mr. Elton ! You like Mr. Elton , papa,--I must look about for a wife for him . There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him -- and he has been here a whole year , and has fitted up his house so comfortably , that it would be a shame to have him single any longer -- and I thought when he was joining their hands to - day , he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him ! I think very well of Mr. Elton , and this is the only way I have of doing him a service . "
3788	3864	3624	3625	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him . But if you want to shew him any attention , my dear , ask him to come and dine with us some day . That will be a much better thing . I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him . "
3865	3879	3881	3882	Mr. Knightley	97	" With a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time , "
3886	3952	3881	3882	Mr. Knightley	97	" and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing . Invite him to dinner , Emma , and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken , but leave him to chuse his own wife . Depend upon it , a man of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself . "
5211	5268	5206	5207	Mrs. Weston	169	" I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston ? I understand it was a very handsome letter , indeed . Mr. Woodhouse told me of it . Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life . "
5645	5660	5634	5635	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Ah , poor Miss Taylor ! She would be very glad to stay . "
7869	8027	7857	7858	the ladies	641	" Mrs. Bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs . An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome . Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body . I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you . Miss Bates , let Emma help you to a _ little _ bit of tart -- a _ very _ little bit . Ours are all apple - tarts . You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here . I do not advise the custard . Mrs. Goddard , what say you to _ half _ a glass of wine ? A _ small _ half - glass , put into a tumbler of water ? I do not think it could disagree with you . "
8740	8875	8736	8737	Mrs. Martin	119	" _ two _ parlours , two very good parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard 's drawing - room ; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five - and - twenty years with her ; and of their having eight cows , two of them Alderneys , and one a little Welch cow , a very pretty little Welch cow indeed ; and of Mrs. Martin 's saying as she was so fond of it , it should be called _ her _ cow ; and of their having a very handsome summer - house in their garden , where some day next year they were all to drink tea:--a very handsome summer - house , large enough to hold a dozen people . "
9291	9298	9300	9300	Emma	128	" Well done , Mrs. Martin ! "
9302	9310	9300	9300	Emma	128	" You know what you are about . "
9311	9375	9283	9283	She	119	" And when she had come away , Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen . Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday , and asked all the three teachers , Miss Nash , and Miss Prince , and Miss Richardson , to sup with her . "
9376	9402	9300	9300	Emma	128	" Mr. Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ? He does not read ? "
9403	9544	9283	9283	She	119	" Oh yes!--that is , no -- I do not know -- but I believe he has read a good deal -- but not what you would think any thing of . He reads the Agricultural Reports , and some other books that lay in one of the window seats -- but he reads all _ them _ to himself . But sometimes of an evening , before we went to cards , he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts , very entertaining . And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield . He never read the Romance of the Forest , nor The Children of the Abbey . He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them , but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can . "
9549	9559	9300	9300	Emma	128	" What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin ? "
9560	9638	9300	9300	Emma	128	" Oh ! not handsome -- not at all handsome . I thought him very plain at first , but I do not think him so plain now . One does not , you know , after a time . But did you never see him ? He is in Highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston . He has passed you very often . "
9639	9766	9300	9300	Emma	128	" That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name . A young farmer , whether on horseback or on foot , is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity . The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do . A degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other . But a farmer can need none of my help , and is , therefore , in one sense , as much above my notice as in every other he is below it . "
9767	9799	9300	9300	Emma	128	" To be sure . Oh yes ! It is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed -- I mean by sight . "
9800	9842	9300	9300	Emma	128	" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man . I know , indeed , that he is so , and , as such , wish him well . What do you imagine his age to be ? "
9843	9877	9300	9300	Emma	128	" He was four - and - twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day 's difference -- which is very odd . "
9878	9965	9300	9300	Emma	128	" Only four - and - twenty . That is too young to settle . His mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry . They seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it . Six years hence , if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own , with a little money , it might be very desirable . "
9966	9982	9300	9300	Emma	128	" Six years hence ! Dear Miss Woodhouse , he would be thirty years old ! "
9983	10098	9300	9300	Emma	128	" Well , and that is as early as most men can afford to marry , who are not born to an independence . Mr. Martin , I imagine , has his fortune entirely to make -- cannot be at all beforehand with the world . Whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , I dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet . "
10099	10140	9300	9300	Emma	128	" To be sure , so it is . But they live very comfortably . They have no indoors man , else they do not want for any thing ; and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year . "
10141	10265	9300	9300	Emma	128	" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry;--I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice . The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates . There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman 's daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you . "
10266	10307	9300	9300	Emma	128	" Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are . But while I visit at Hartfield , and you are so kind to me , Miss Woodhouse , I am not afraid of what any body can do . "
10308	10425	9300	9300	Emma	128	" You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse . I want to see you permanently well connected , and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries , I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters , to be acquainted with the wife , who will probably be some mere farmer 's daughter , without education . "
10426	10547	9300	9300	Emma	128	" To be sure . Yes . Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up . However , I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's -- and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife . I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins , especially Elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me . But if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly I had better not visit her , if I can help it . "
10812	10936	10785	10785	Harriet	115	" Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd ! It was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by Randalls . He did not think we ever walked this road . He thought we walked towards Randalls most days . He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet . He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow . So very odd we should happen to meet ! Well , Miss Woodhouse , is he like what you expected ? What do you think of him ? Do you think him so very plain ? "
10937	11006	10804	10805	Miss Woodhouse	98	" He is very plain , undoubtedly -- remarkably plain:--but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility . I had no right to expect much , and I did not expect much ; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish , so totally without air . I had imagined him , I confess , a degree or two nearer gentility . "
11007	11012	11014	11014	Harriet	115	" To be sure , "
11021	11031	11014	11014	Harriet	115	" he is not so genteel as real gentlemen . "
11032	11180	10804	10805	Miss Woodhouse	98	" I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin . At Hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men . I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before . Do not you begin to feel that now ? Were not you struck ? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here . "
11181	11223	11014	11014	Harriet	115	" Certainly , he is not like Mr. Knightley . He has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley . I see the difference plain enough . But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man ! "
11224	11324	10804	10805	Miss Woodhouse	98	" Mr. Knightley 's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with _ him _ . You might not see one in a hundred with _ gentleman _ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley . But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to . What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton ? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _ them _ . Compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent . You must see the difference . "
11325	11351	11014	11014	Harriet	115	" Oh yes!--there is a great difference . But Mr. Weston is almost an old man . Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty . "
11352	11429	10804	10805	Miss Woodhouse	98	" Which makes his good manners the more valuable . The older a person grows , Harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes . What is passable in youth is detestable in later age . Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at Mr. Weston 's time of life ? "
11430	11438	11440	11440	Harriet	115	" There is no saying , indeed , "
11444	11477	10804	10805	Miss Woodhouse	98	" But there may be pretty good guessing . He will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss . "
11478	11490	10804	10805	Miss Woodhouse	98	" Will he , indeed ? That will be very bad . "
11491	11588	10804	10805	Miss Woodhouse	98	" How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended . He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else -- which is just as it should be , for a thriving man . What has he to do with books ? And I have no doubt that he _ will _ thrive , and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _ us _ . "
11589	11597	10804	10805	Miss Woodhouse	98	" I wonder he did not remember the book"--was
11637	11888	11632	11632	Her	115	" In one respect , perhaps , Mr. Elton 's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley 's or Mr. Weston 's . They have more gentleness . They might be more safely held up as a pattern . There is an openness , a quickness , almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston , which every body likes in _ him _ , because there is so much good - humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied . Neither would Mr. Knightley 's downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _ him _ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable . On the contrary , I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model . Mr. Elton is good - humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle . He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late . I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , Harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be . If he means any thing , it must be to please you . Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day ? "
12296	12310	12312	12313	Mr. Knightley	97	" I do not know what your opinion may be , Mrs. Weston , "
12315	12334	12312	12313	Mr. Knightley	97	" of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith , but I think it a bad thing . "
12335	12350	12850	12851	Mrs. Weston	169	" A bad thing ! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so ? "
12351	12365	12312	12313	Mr. Knightley	97	" I think they will neither of them do the other any good . "
12366	12439	12850	12851	Mrs. Weston	169	" You surprize me ! Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good . I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good ! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma , Mr. Knightley . "
12440	12470	12312	12313	Mr. Knightley	97	" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle . "
12471	12662	12850	12851	Mrs. Weston	169	" Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject . We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with . Mr. Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith . She is not the superior young woman which Emma 's friend ought to be . But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself . They will read together . She means it , I know . "
12663	12842	12312	12313	Mr. Knightley	97	" Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old . I have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule . The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now . But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma . She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding . Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate , I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not . "
12843	12848	12850	12851	Mrs. Weston	169	" I dare say , "
12855	12881	12850	12851	Mrs. Weston	169	" that I thought so _ then_;--but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma 's omitting to do any thing I wished . "
12882	12895	12896	12897	Mr. Knightley	97	" There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _ that_,"--said
12911	12915	12916	12916	he	97	" But I , "
12920	13035	12916	12916	he	97	" who have had no such charm thrown over my senses , must still see , hear , and remember . Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family . At ten years old , she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen . She was always quick and assured : Isabella slow and diffident . And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all . In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her . She inherits her mother 's talents , and must have been under subjection to her . "
13036	13098	12896	12897	Mr. Knightley	97	" I should have been sorry , Mr. Knightley , to be dependent on _ your _ recommendation , had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse 's family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body . I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held . "
13099	13102	13104	13104	he	708	" Yes , "
13108	13218	13104	13104	he	708	" You are better placed _ here _ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess . But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield . You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise ; but you were receiving a very good education from _ her _ , on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will , and doing as you were bid ; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife , I should certainly have named Miss Taylor . "
13219	13242	12896	12897	Mr. Knightley	97	" Thank you . There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr. Weston . "
13243	13300	13104	13104	he	708	" Why , to own the truth , I am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne . We will not despair , however . Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort , or his son may plague him . "
13301	13324	12896	12897	Mr. Knightley	97	" I hope not _ that_.--It is not likely . No , Mr. Knightley , do not foretell vexation from that quarter . "
13325	13556	13104	13104	he	708	" Not I , indeed . I only name possibilities . I do not pretend to Emma 's genius for foretelling and guessing . I hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a Weston in merit , and a Churchill in fortune.--But Harriet Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith . I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have . She knows nothing herself , and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing . She is a flatterer in all her ways ; and so much the worse , because undesigned . Her ignorance is hourly flattery . How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ? And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _ she _ can not gain by the acquaintance . Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to . She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home . I am much mistaken if Emma 's doctrines give any strength of mind , or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.--They only give a little polish . "
13557	13595	12896	12897	Mr. Knightley	97	" I either depend more upon Emma 's good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I can not lament the acquaintance . How well she looked last night ! "
13596	13627	13104	13104	he	708	" Oh ! you would rather talk of her person than her mind , would you ? Very well ; I shall not attempt to deny Emma 's being pretty . "
13628	13651	12896	12897	Mr. Knightley	97	" Pretty ! say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether -- face and figure ? "
13652	13689	13104	13104	he	708	" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . But I am a partial old friend . "
13690	13802	12896	12897	Mr. Knightley	97	" Such an eye!--the true hazle eye -- and so brilliant ! regular features , open countenance , with a complexion ! oh ! what a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ` the picture of health ; ' now , Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown - up health . She is loveliness itself . Mr. Knightley , is not she ? "
13803	13815	13816	13816	he	709	" I have not a fault to find with her person , "
13819	13899	13816	13816	he	709	" I think her all you describe . I love to look at her ; and I will add this praise , that I do not think her personally vain . Considering how very handsome she is , she appears to be little occupied with it ; her vanity lies another way . Mrs. Weston , I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith , or my dread of its doing them both harm . "
13900	13995	12896	12897	Mr. Knightley	97	" And I , Mr. Knightley , am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm . With all dear Emma 's little faults , she is an excellent creature . Where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ? No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times . "
13996	14072	13816	13816	he	709	" Very well ; I will not plague you any more . Emma shall be an angel , and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella . John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children . I am sure of having their opinions with me . "
14073	14240	12896	12897	Mr. Knightley	97	" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma 's mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith 's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you . Pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it can not be expected that Emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself . It has been so many years my province to give advice , that you can not be surprized , Mr. Knightley , at this little remains of office . "
14241	14246	14248	14248	he	710	" Not at all , "
14250	14287	14248	14248	he	710	" I am much obliged to you for it . It is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to . "
14288	14305	12896	12897	Mr. Knightley	97	" Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister . "
14306	14310	14312	14312	he	710	" Be satisfied , "
14314	14383	14312	14312	he	710	" I will not raise any outcry . I will keep my ill - humour to myself . I have a very sincere interest in Emma . Isabella does not seem more my sister ; has never excited a greater interest ; perhaps hardly so great . There is an anxiety , a curiosity in what one feels for Emma . I wonder what will become of her ! "
14384	14389	14391	14392	Mrs. Weston	169	" So do I , "
14395	14399	14391	14392	Mrs. Weston	169	" very much . "
14400	14497	12896	12897	Mr. Knightley	97	" She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all . But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for . It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object . I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good . But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home . "
14498	14517	14519	14520	Mrs. Weston	169	" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present , "
14522	14583	14519	14520	Mrs. Weston	169	" as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I can not wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse 's account . I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma , though I mean no slight to the state , I assure you . "
14641	14655	14659	14659	he	92	" What does Weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ? "
14856	14867	14869	14869	he	100	" You have given Miss Smith all that she required , "
14871	14912	14869	14869	he	100	" you have made her graceful and easy . She was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature . "
14913	14963	14869	14869	he	100	" I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints . She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself . I have done very little . "
14964	14974	14976	14979	the gallant Mr. Elton--	129	" If it were admissible to contradict a lady , "
14980	15009	14869	14869	he	100	" I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before . "
15010	15034	14869	14869	he	100	" Exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me . So much superadded decision of character ! Skilful has been the hand ! "
15035	15056	14869	14869	he	100	" Great has been the pleasure , I am sure . I never met with a disposition more truly amiable . "
15057	15065	14869	14869	he	100	" I have no doubt of it . "
15112	15123	15125	15125	she	714	" Did you ever have your likeness taken , Harriet ? "
15127	15136	15125	15125	she	714	" did you ever sit for your picture ? "
15159	15168	15137	15137	Harriet	115	" Oh ! dear , no , never . "
15181	15293	15178	15178	Emma	128	" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be ! I would give any money for it . I almost long to attempt her likeness myself . You do not know it I dare say , but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general . But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust . But really , I could almost venture , if Harriet would sit to me . It would be such a delight to have her picture ! "
15294	15300	15302	15303	Mr. Elton	100	" Let me entreat you , "
15305	15379	15302	15303	Mr. Elton	100	" it would indeed be a delight ! Let me entreat you , Miss Woodhouse , to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend . I know what your drawings are . How could you suppose me ignorant ? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room , at Randalls ? "
15421	15482	15414	15414	your	128	" Well , if you give me such kind encouragement , Mr. Elton , I believe I shall try what I can do . Harriet 's features are very delicate , which makes a likeness difficult ; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch . "
15483	15535	15302	15303	Mr. Elton	100	" Exactly so -- The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- I have not a doubt of your success . Pray , pray attempt it . As you will do it , it will indeed , to use your own words , be an exquisite possession . "
15536	15585	15414	15414	your	128	" But I am afraid , Mr. Elton , Harriet will not like to sit . She thinks so little of her own beauty . Did not you observe her manner of answering me ? How completely it meant , ` why should my picture be drawn ? ' "
15586	15618	15302	15303	Mr. Elton	100	" Oh ! yes , I observed it , I assure you . It was not lost on me . But still I can not imagine she would not be persuaded . "
15916	15925	15927	15927	Emma	128	" No great variety of faces for you , "
15929	16254	15927	15927	Emma	128	" I had only my own family to study from . There is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that I could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore . Mrs. Weston again , and again , and again , you see . Dear Mrs. Weston ! always my kindest friend on every occasion . She would sit whenever I asked her . There is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike . I should have made a good likeness of her , if she would have sat longer , but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet . Then , here come all my attempts at three of those four children;--there they are , Henry and John and Bella , from one end of the sheet to the other , and any one of them might do for any one of the rest . She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama 's children ever were . Here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby . I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see . He had nestled down his head most conveniently . That 's very like . I am rather proud of little George . The corner of the sofa is very good . Then here is my last,"--unclosing
16267	16371	16259	16260	a gentleman	2834	length--"my last and my best -- my brother , Mr. John Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished , when I put it away in a pet , and vowed I would never take another likeness . I could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when I had really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs . Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it _ very _ like)--only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side -- after all this , came poor dear Isabella 's cold approbation of--"Yes
16390	16502	16259	16260	a gentleman	2834	" We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all . It was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than I could bear ; and so I never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and , as I said , I did then forswear ever drawing any body again . But for Harriet 's sake , or rather for my own , and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _ at _ _ present _ , I will break my resolution now . "
16519	16543	16503	16504	Mr. Elton	100	" No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe . Exactly so . No husbands and wives , "
16736	16775	16729	16729	her	115	" If he would be so good as to read to them , it would be a kindness indeed ! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith 's . "
17042	17061	17027	17027	he	100	" By all means . We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party . "
17118	17129	17130	17131	Mrs. Weston	169	" Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted,"--observed
17145	17177	17130	17131	Mrs. Weston	169	lover.--"The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes . It is the fault of her face that she has them not . "
17178	17184	17186	17186	he	100	" Do you think so ? "
17188	17230	17186	17186	he	100	" I can not agree with you . It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature . I never saw such a likeness in my life . We must allow for the effect of shade , you know . "
17231	17241	17243	17244	Mr. Knightley	97	" You have made her too tall , Emma , "
17264	17337	17259	17260	Mr. Elton	100	" Oh no ! certainly not too tall ; not in the least too tall . Consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know . Proportions , fore - shortening.--Oh no ! it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith 's . Exactly so indeed ! "
17338	17344	17346	17347	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" It is very pretty , "
17349	17417	17346	17347	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" So prettily done ! Just as your drawings always are , my dear . I do not know any body who draws so well as you do . The only thing I do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold . "
17418	17443	17259	17260	Mr. Elton	100	" But , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer . Look at the tree . "
17444	17459	17346	17347	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" But it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear . "
17460	17470	17472	17473	Mr. Elton	100	" You , sir , may say any thing , "
17475	17554	17472	17473	Mr. Elton	100	" but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of Miss Smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit ! Any other situation would have been much less in character . The naivete of Miss Smith 's manners -- and altogether -- Oh , it is most admirable ! I can not keep my eyes from it . I never saw such a likeness . "
17670	17717	17662	17662	His	100	" Might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it ! he could ride to London at any time . It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand . "
17718	17738	17623	17623	December	133	" He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world,"--brought
17803	17809	17811	17811	he	100	" What a precious deposit ! "
17822	17834	17836	17836	Emma	128	" This man is almost too gallant to be in love , "
17838	17930	17836	17836	Emma	128	" I should say so , but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love . He is an excellent young man , and will suit Harriet exactly ; it will be an ` Exactly so , ' as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal . I come in for a pretty good share as a second . But it is his gratitude on Harriet 's account . "
18124	18200	18201	18201	Emma	128	" Who could have thought it ? She was so surprized she did not know what to do . Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so . And he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.-- "
18217	18222	18223	18223	she	128	" Upon my word , "
18226	18251	18223	18223	she	128	" the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking . He will connect himself well if he can . "
18252	18259	18261	18261	Harriet	115	" Will you read the letter ? "
18263	18273	18261	18261	Harriet	115	" Pray do . I 'd rather you would . "
18382	18387	18366	18366	She	128	" Well , well , "
18396	18409	18366	18366	She	128	" Is it a good letter ? or is it too short ? "
18410	18420	18422	18422	Emma	128	" Yes , indeed , a very good letter , "
18424	18591	18422	18422	Emma	128	slowly--"so good a letter , Harriet , that every thing considered , I think one of his sisters must have helped him . I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman . No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words . It is so with some men . Yes , I understand the sort of mind . Vigorous , decided , with sentiments to a certain point , not coarse . A better written letter , Harriet ( returning it , ) than I had expected . "
18592	18595	18366	18366	She	128	" Well , "
18600	18610	18366	18366	She	128	Harriet;--"well -- and -- and what shall I do ? "
18611	18630	18366	18366	She	128	" What shall you do ! In what respect ? Do you mean with regard to this letter ? "
18631	18634	18366	18366	She	128	" Yes . "
18635	18654	18366	18366	She	128	" But what are you in doubt of ? You must answer it of course -- and speedily . "
18655	18672	18366	18366	She	128	" Yes . But what shall I say ? Dear Miss Woodhouse , do advise me . "
18673	18774	18366	18366	She	128	" Oh no , no ! the letter had much better be all your own . You will express yourself very properly , I am sure . There is no danger of your not being intelligible , which is the first thing . Your meaning must be unequivocal ; no doubts or demurs : and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires , will present themselves unbidden to _ your _ mind , I am persuaded . You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment . "
18775	18785	18787	18787	Harriet	115	" You think I ought to refuse him then , "
18792	18870	18366	18366	She	128	" Ought to refuse him ! My dear Harriet , what do you mean ? Are you in any doubt as to that ? I thought -- but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have been under a mistake . I certainly have been misunderstanding you , if you feel in doubt as to the _ purport _ of your answer . I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it . "
18885	18897	18882	18882	Emma	128	" You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect . "
18898	18940	18366	18366	She	128	" No , I do not ; that is , I do not mean -- What shall I do ? What would you advise me to do ? Pray , dear Miss Woodhouse , tell me what I ought to do . "
18941	18973	18882	18882	Emma	128	" I shall not give you any advice , Harriet . I will have nothing to do with it . This is a point which you must settle with your feelings . "
18974	18987	18989	18989	Harriet	115	" I had no notion that he liked me so very much , "
19027	19134	19020	19020	she	128	" I lay it down as a general rule , Harriet , that if a woman _ doubts _ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him . If she can hesitate as to ` Yes , ' she ought to say ` No ' directly . It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings , with half a heart . I thought it my duty as a friend , and older than yourself , to say thus much to you . But do not imagine that I want to influence you . "
19135	19221	19020	19020	she	128	" Oh ! no , I am sure you are a great deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me what I had best do -- No , no , I do not mean that -- As you say , one 's mind ought to be quite made up -- One should not be hesitating -- It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say ` No , ' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say ` No ? ' "
19222	19228	19230	19230	Emma	128	" Not for the world , "
19235	19332	19230	19230	Emma	128	" would I advise you either way . You must be the best judge of your own happiness . If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ? You blush , Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition ? Harriet , Harriet , do not deceive yourself ; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion . At this moment whom are you thinking of ? "
19393	19444	19391	19391	Harriet	115	" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr. Martin . Do you think I am right ? "
19445	19582	19391	19391	Harriet	115	" Perfectly , perfectly right , my dearest Harriet ; you are doing just what you ought . While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving . Dear Harriet , I give myself joy of this . It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin . While you were in the smallest degree wavering , I said nothing about it , because I would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me . I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin , of Abbey - Mill Farm . Now I am secure of you for ever . "
19600	19608	19609	19609	she	115	" You could not have visited me ! "
19615	19665	19609	19609	she	115	" No , to be sure you could not ; but I never thought of that before . That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world . "
19666	19706	19391	19391	Harriet	115	" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been . You would have thrown yourself out of all good society . I must have given you up . "
19707	19730	19609	19609	she	115	" Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it ! It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more ! "
19731	19780	19391	19391	Harriet	115	" Dear affectionate creature!--_You _ banished to Abbey - Mill Farm!--_You _ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life ! I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it . He must have a pretty good opinion of himself . "
19781	19794	19796	19796	Harriet	115	" I do not think he is conceited either , in general , "
19804	19957	19796	19796	Harriet	115	" at least , he is very good natured , and I shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that I should -- and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _ one _ is so very handsome and agreeable . However , I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but as to leaving you , it is what I would not do upon any consideration . "
19958	20006	20120	20120	Emma	128	" Thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend . We will not be parted . A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter . "
20007	20018	19796	19796	Harriet	115	" Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too . "
20034	20074	20120	20120	Emma	128	" very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter . "
20075	20119	20120	20120	Emma	128	" Oh ! yes , very . Nobody cares for a letter ; the thing is , to be always happy with pleasant companions . I am quite determined to refuse him . But how shall I do ? What shall I say ? "
20335	20347	20570	20570	Harriet	115	" I shall never be invited to Abbey - Mill again , "
20356	20392	20570	20570	Harriet	115	" Nor , if you were , could I ever bear to part with you , my Harriet . You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey - Mill . "
20393	20415	20570	20570	Harriet	115	" And I am sure I should never want to go there ; for I am never happy but at Hartfield . "
20422	20466	20570	20570	Harriet	115	" I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened . I am sure Miss Nash would -- for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen - draper . "
20467	20569	20570	20570	Harriet	115	" One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , Harriet . I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married . Even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes . As to any thing superior for you , I suppose she is quite in the dark . The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle - tattle of Highbury yet . Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves . "
20616	20624	20626	20626	she	115	" Now he has got my letter , "
20629	20665	20626	20626	she	115	" I wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too . I hope he will not mind it so very much . "
20666	20682	20684	20684	Emma	128	" Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed , "
20686	20737	20684	20684	Emma	128	" At this moment , perhaps , Mr. Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original , and after being asked for it five or six times , allowing them to hear your name , your own dear name . "
20738	20751	20626	20626	she	115	" My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond - street . "
20752	20856	20684	20684	Emma	128	" Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton . No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow . It is his companion all this evening , his solace , his delight . It opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession . How cheerful , how animated , how suspicious , how busy their imaginations all are ! "
21075	21155	21336	21336	He	97	" Well , I believe , if you will excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing , I shall take Emma 's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour . As the sun is out , I believe I had better take my three turns while I can . I treat you without ceremony , Mr. Knightley . We invalids think we are privileged people . "
21156	21169	21336	21336	He	97	" My dear sir , do not make a stranger of me . "
21170	21207	21336	21336	He	97	" I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter . Emma will be happy to entertain you . And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk . "
21208	21217	21336	21336	He	97	" You can not do better , sir . "
21218	21265	21336	21336	He	97	" I would ask for the pleasure of your company , Mr. Knightley , but I am a very slow walker , and my pace would be tedious to you ; and , besides , you have another long walk before you , to Donwell Abbey . "
21266	21307	21336	21336	He	97	" Thank you , sir , thank you ; I am going this moment myself ; and I think the sooner _ you _ go the better . I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you . "
21357	21368	21370	21370	he	97	" I can not rate her beauty as you do , "
21372	21414	21370	21370	he	97	" but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition . Her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman . "
21415	21436	21336	21336	He	97	" I am glad you think so ; and the good hands , I hope , may not be wanting . "
21437	21440	21442	21442	he	97	" Come , "
21444	21481	21442	21442	he	97	" you are anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you that you have improved her . You have cured her of her school - girl 's giggle ; she really does you credit . "
21482	21528	21336	21336	He	97	" Thank you . I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may . _ You _ do not often overpower me with it . "
21529	21542	21442	21442	he	97	" You are expecting her again , you say , this morning ? "
21543	21558	21336	21336	He	97	" Almost every moment . She has been gone longer already than she intended . "
21559	21571	21442	21442	he	97	" Something has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps . "
21572	21577	21336	21336	He	97	" Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches ! "
21578	21590	21442	21442	he	97	" Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would . "
21613	21649	21605	21605	He	753	" I do not pretend to fix on times or places , but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage . "
21650	21660	21605	21605	He	753	" Indeed ! how so ? of what sort ? "
21661	21671	21605	21605	He	753	" A very serious sort , I assure you ; "
21675	21700	21605	21605	He	753	" Very serious ! I can think of but one thing -- Who is in love with her ? Who makes you their confidant ? "
21738	21745	21746	21746	he	97	" I have reason to think , "
21749	21800	21746	21746	he	97	" that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert Martin is the man . Her visit to Abbey - Mill , this summer , seems to have done his business . He is desperately in love and means to marry her . "
21801	21807	21809	21809	Emma	128	" He is very obliging , "
21811	21823	21809	21809	Emma	128	" but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him ? "
21824	22190	21746	21746	he	97	" Well , well , means to make her an offer then . Will that do ? He came to the Abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it . He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , I believe , considers me as one of his best friends . He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether I thought her too young : in short , whether I approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _ your _ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him . I was very much pleased with all that he said . I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin . He always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging . He told me every thing ; his circumstances and plans , and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage . He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother . I had no hesitation in advising him to marry . He proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , I was convinced he could not do better . I praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy . If he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , I dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had . This happened the night before last . Now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard 's to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch . "
22191	22197	22199	22199	Emma	128	" Pray , Mr. Knightley , "
22215	22228	22199	22199	Emma	128	" how do you know that Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday ? "
22229	22232	22234	22234	he	755	" Certainly , "
22238	22261	22234	22234	he	755	" I do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred . Was not she the whole day with you ? "
22262	22265	22267	22267	she	128	" Come , "
22269	22300	22267	22267	she	128	" I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me . He did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused . "
22336	22356	22325	22325	he	97	" Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her . What is the foolish girl about ? "
22357	22364	22366	22366	Emma	128	" Oh ! to be sure , "
22368	22403	22366	22366	Emma	128	" it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage . A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her . "
22404	22444	22325	22325	he	97	" Nonsense ! a man does not imagine any such thing . But what is the meaning of this ? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin ? madness , if it is so ; but I hope you are mistaken . "
22445	22454	22366	22366	Emma	128	" I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer . "
22455	22479	22325	22325	he	97	" You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too . Emma , this is your doing . You persuaded her to refuse him . "
22480	22566	22366	22366	Emma	128	" And if I did , ( which , however , I am far from allowing ) I should not feel that I had done wrong . Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man , but I can not admit him to be Harriet 's equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her . By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples . It is a pity that they were ever got over . "
22567	22573	22575	22576	Mr. Knightley	97	" Not Harriet 's equal ! "
22593	22978	22366	22366	Emma	128	" No , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation . Emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you . What are Harriet Smith 's claims , either of birth , nature or education , to any connexion higher than Robert Martin ? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations . She is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school . She is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information . She has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself . At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her . She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all . My only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him . I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse . But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well . The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have I now ) that there would be a general cry - out upon her extreme good luck . Even _ your _ satisfaction I made sure of . It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend 's leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well . I remember saying to myself , ` Even Emma , with all her partiality for Harriet , will think this a good match . ' "
22979	23143	22366	22366	Emma	128	" I can not help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing . What ! think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more , ) a good match for my intimate friend ! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own ! I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings . I assure you mine are very different . I must think your statement by no means fair . You are not just to Harriet 's claims . They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves is much above his.--It would be a degradation . "
23144	23164	22366	22366	Emma	128	" A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer ! "
23165	23285	22366	22366	Emma	128	" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense . She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman 's daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen 's daughters , no one , I apprehend , will deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin . "
23286	23293	23295	23296	Mr. Knightley	97	" Whoever might be her parents , "
23298	23530	23295	23296	Mr. Knightley	97	" whoever may have had the charge of her , it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society . After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard 's hands to shift as she can;--to move , in short , in Mrs. Goddard 's line , to have Mrs. Goddard 's acquaintance . Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _ was _ good enough . She desired nothing better herself . Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it . She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer . She had no sense of superiority then . If she has it now , you have given it . You have been no friend to Harriet Smith , Emma . Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him . I know him well . He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion . And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know . Depend upon it he had encouragement . "
23561	23853	22366	22366	Emma	128	" You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet . Harriet 's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice . Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess . "
23854	23892	22366	22366	Emma	128	" Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too . Better be without sense , than misapply it as you do . "
23893	23898	23900	23900	she	756	" To be sure ! "
23903	24013	23900	23900	she	756	" I know _ that _ is the feeling of you all . I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment . Oh ! Harriet may pick and chuse . Were you , yourself , ever to marry , she is the very woman for you . And is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ? No -- pray let her have time to look about her . "
24014	24025	24027	24028	Mr. Knightley	97	" I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy , "
24031	24314	24027	24028	Mr. Knightley	97	" though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet . You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her . Vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief . Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high . Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl . Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives . Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed . Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour - boarder at Mrs. Goddard 's all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other , ) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master 's son . "
24315	24562	24576	24578	Mr. Knightley.--"Robert Martin	137	" We think so very differently on this point , Mr. Knightley , that there can be no use in canvassing it . We shall only be making each other more angry . But as to my _ letting _ her marry Robert Martin , it is impossible ; she has refused him , and so decidedly , I think , as must prevent any second application . She must abide by the evil of having refused him , whatever it may be ; and as to the refusal itself , I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little ; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do . His appearance is so much against him , and his manner so bad , that if she ever were disposed to favour him , she is not now . I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him . He was the brother of her friends , and he took pains to please her ; and altogether , having seen nobody better ( that must have been his great assistant ) she might not , while she was at Abbey - Mill , find him disagreeable . But the case is altered now . She knows now what gentlemen are ; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet . "
24563	24574	24576	24578	Mr. Knightley.--"Robert Martin	137	" Nonsense , errant nonsense , as ever was talked ! "
24577	24607	24576	24578	Mr. Knightley.--"Robert Martin	137	Knightley.--"Robert Martin 's manners have sense , sincerity , and good - humour to recommend them ; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand . "
24751	24843	24849	24849	He	757	" Robert Martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so ; and I hope it will not be long before he does . Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain . "
24852	25013	24849	24849	He	757	" Depend upon it , Elton will not do . Elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of Highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match . He knows the value of a good income as well as any body . Elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally . He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet 's . He knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away . I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with , who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece . "
25014	25023	25025	25025	Emma	128	" I am very much obliged to you , "
25030	25097	25025	25025	Emma	128	" If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton 's marrying Harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself . I have done with match - making indeed . I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls . I shall leave off while I am well . "
25098	25102	25103	25103	he	758	" Good morning to you,"--said
25931	25985	25918	25919	Mr. Elton	100	" that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness . "
26459	26490	26433	26434	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them ! but he hoped he should in time . "
26496	26505	26433	26434	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Kitty , a fair but frozen maid . "
26741	26755	26757	26757	she	2732	" Why will not you write one yourself for us , Mr. Elton ? "
26759	26777	26757	26757	she	2732	" that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you . "
26778	26809	26851	26851	he	100	" Oh no ! he had never written , hardly ever , any thing of the kind in his life . The stupidest fellow ! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse"--he
26812	26819	26851	26851	he	100	moment--"or Miss Smith could inspire him . "
26891	26903	26905	26905	he	100	" I do not offer it for Miss Smith 's collection , "
26907	26938	26905	26905	he	100	" Being my friend 's , I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye , but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it . "
26986	26990	26992	26992	Emma	128	" Take it , "
27001	27010	26992	26992	Emma	128	Harriet--"it is for you . Take your own . "
27204	27270	27189	27189	Harriet	115	" Very well , Mr. Elton , very well indeed . I have read worse charades . _ Courtship_--a very good hint . I give you credit for it . This is feeling your way . This is saying very plainly--`Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you . Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance . '
27428	27515	27395	27395	She	115	" What can it be , Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be ? I have not an idea -- I can not guess it in the least . What can it possibly be ? Do try to find it out , Miss Woodhouse . Do help me . I never saw any thing so hard . Is it kingdom ? I wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady . Do you think it is a good one ? Can it be woman ?
27591	27591	27578	27579	Miss Woodhouse	98	"
27592	27637	27643	27644	Miss Smith	115	" Mermaids and sharks ! Nonsense ! My dear Harriet , what are you thinking of ? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark ? Give me the paper and listen .
27802	27802	27803	27803	Harriet	115	"
27852	27867	27869	27869	she	128	" There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment , "
27871	28106	27869	27869	she	128	" that I can not have a doubt as to Mr. Elton 's intentions . You are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it . I thought it must be so . I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you . Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened . I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural . Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other ! I am very happy . I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart . This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating . This is a connexion which offers nothing but good . It will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to Hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever . This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us . "
28107	28110	28164	28165	Mr. Elton	100	" Dear Miss Woodhouse!"--and
28111	28116	27869	27869	she	128	" Dear Miss Woodhouse , "
28173	28181	28183	28183	Harriet	115	" Whatever you say is always right , "
28185	28268	28183	28183	Harriet	115	" and therefore I suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise I could not have imagined it . It is so much beyond any thing I deserve . Mr. Elton , who might marry any body ! There can not be two opinions about _ him _ . He is so very superior . Only think of those sweet verses--`To Miss -------- . ' Dear me , how clever!--Could it really be meant for me ? "
28269	28325	28164	28165	Mr. Elton	100	" I can not make a question , or listen to a question about that . It is a certainty . Receive it on my judgment . It is a sort of prologue to the play , a motto to the chapter ; and will be soon followed by matter - of - fact prose . "
28326	28359	28183	28183	Harriet	115	" It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected . I am sure , a month ago , I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do take place ! "
28360	28483	28164	28165	Mr. Elton	100	" When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted -- they do indeed -- and really it is strange ; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently , so palpably desirable -- what courts the pre - arrangement of other people , should so immediately shape itself into the proper form . You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes . Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls . There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction , and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow .
28507	28507	28497	28497	Shakespeare	149	"
28508	28727	28183	28183	Harriet	115	" That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me , of all people , who did not know him , to speak to him , at Michaelmas ! And he , the very handsomest man that ever was , and a man that every body looks up to , quite like Mr. Knightley ! His company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week . And so excellent in the Church ! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury . Dear me ! When I look back to the first time I saw him ! How little did I think!--The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good - natured . And how beautiful we thought he looked ! He was arm - in - arm with Mr. Cole . "
28728	28861	28497	28497	Shakespeare	149	" This is an alliance which , whoever -- whatever your friends may be , must be agreeable to them , provided at least they have common sense ; and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools . If they are anxious to see you _ happily _ married , here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in , here it will be accomplished ; and if their only object is that you should , in the common phrase , be _ well _ married , here is the comfortable fortune , the respectable establishment , the rise in the world which must satisfy them . "
28862	28914	28183	28183	Harriet	115	" Yes , very true . How nicely you talk ; I love to hear you . You understand every thing . You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other . This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth , I could never have made any thing like it . "
28915	28933	28497	28497	Shakespeare	149	" I thought he meant to try his skill , by his manner of declining it yesterday . "
28934	28951	28183	28183	Harriet	115	" I do think it is , without exception , the best charade I ever read . "
28952	28964	28497	28497	Shakespeare	149	" I never read one more to the purpose , certainly . "
28965	28979	28183	28183	Harriet	115	" It is as long again as almost all we have had before . "
28980	29003	28497	28497	Shakespeare	149	" I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour . Such things in general can not be too short . "
29024	29030	29032	29032	she	115	" It is one thing , "
29040	29095	29036	29036	her	115	glow--"to have very good sense in a common way , like every body else , and if there is any thing to say , to sit down and write a letter , and say just what you must , in a short way ; and another , to write verses and charades like this . "
29111	29116	28183	28183	Harriet	115	" Such sweet lines ! "
29118	29150	28497	28497	Shakespeare	149	Harriet--"these two last!--But how shall I ever be able to return the paper , or say I have found it out?--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what can we do about that ? "
29151	29211	28183	28183	Harriet	115	" Leave it to me . You do nothing . He will be here this evening , I dare say , and then I will give it him back , and some nonsense or other will pass between us , and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming . Trust to me . "
29212	29245	28497	28497	Shakespeare	149	" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book ! I am sure I have not got one half so good . "
29246	29269	28183	28183	Harriet	115	" Leave out the two last lines , and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book . "
29270	29277	28497	28497	Shakespeare	149	" Oh ! but those two lines are"--
29278	29405	28183	28183	Harriet	115	--"The best of all . Granted;--for private enjoyment ; and for private enjoyment keep them . They are not at all the less written you know , because you divide them . The couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change . But take it away , and all _ appropriation _ ceases , and a very pretty gallant charade remains , fit for any collection . Depend upon it , he would not like to have his charade slighted , much better than his passion . A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities , or neither . Give me the book , I will write it down , and then there can be no possible reflection on you . "
29448	29462	29464	29464	she	115	" I shall never let that book go out of my own hands , "
29466	29470	29472	29472	Emma	128	" Very well , "
29474	29557	29472	29472	Emma	128	" a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better I shall be pleased . But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him . It will be giving him so much pleasure ! He loves any thing of the sort , and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment . He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him . "
29562	29682	29558	29558	Harriet	115	" My dear Harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade.--You will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it . Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration . If he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while I was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you . Do not let us be too solemn on the business . He has encouragement enough to proceed , without our sighing out our souls over this charade . "
29683	29703	29558	29558	Harriet	115	" Oh ! no -- I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it . Do as you please . "
29727	29745	29558	29558	Harriet	115	" Well , my dears , how does your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh ? "
29746	29793	29794	29794	She	827	" Yes , papa ; we have something to read you , something quite fresh . A piece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt , we suppose , by a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade , and we have just copied it in . "
29851	29907	29924	29924	he	91	" Aye , that 's very just , indeed , that 's very properly said . Very true . ` Woman , lovely woman . ' It is such a pretty charade , my dear , that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written so prettily , but you , Emma . "
29927	29987	29924	29924	he	91	" Ah ! it is no difficulty to see who you take after ! Your dear mother was so clever at all those things ! If I had but her memory ! But I can remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention ; I can only recollect the first stanza ; and there are several .
30062	30062	30055	30055	you	2723	"
30063	30093	30055	30055	you	2723	" Yes , papa , it is written out in our second page . We copied it from the Elegant Extracts . It was Garrick 's , you know . "
30094	30106	30107	30107	Kitty	139	" Aye , very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it .
30169	30169	30147	30147	you	2723	"
30170	30210	30147	30147	you	2723	" Oh ! yes -- she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual , you know . Why should there be any change ? "
30211	30274	30147	30147	you	2723	" I do not know , my dear -- but it is so long since she was here!--not since last Easter , and then only for a few days.--Mr . John Knightley 's being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly taken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here ! "
30275	30287	30147	30147	you	2723	" She will not be surprized , papa , at least . "
30288	30316	30147	30147	you	2723	" I do not know , my dear . I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married . "
30317	30335	30147	30147	you	2723	" We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us , while Isabella is here . "
30336	30366	30147	30147	you	2723	" Yes , my dear , if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she is coming for only one week . There will not be time for any thing . "
30367	30466	30147	30147	you	2723	" It is unfortunate that they can not stay longer -- but it seems a case of necessity . Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th , and we ought to be thankful , papa , that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country , that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey . Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas -- though you know it is longer since they were with him , than with us . "
30467	30490	30147	30147	you	2723	" It would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield . "
30528	30576	30517	30517	He	91	" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does . I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . She and the children might stay very well . "
30577	30612	30517	30517	He	91	" Ah ! papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish , and I do not think you ever will . Isabella can not bear to stay behind her husband . "
30668	30727	30653	30653	she	128	" Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here . I am sure she will be pleased with the children . We are very proud of the children , are not we , papa ? I wonder which she will think the handsomest , Henry or John ? "
30728	30760	30653	30653	she	128	" Aye , I wonder which she will . Poor little dears , how glad they will be to come . They are very fond of being at Hartfield , Harriet . "
30761	30781	30653	30653	she	128	" I dare say they are , sir . I am sure I do not know who is not . "
30782	30935	30653	30653	she	128	" Henry is a fine boy , but John is very like his mama . Henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father . John , the second , is named after his father . Some people are surprized , I believe , that the eldest was not , but Isabella would have him called Henry , which I thought very pretty of her . And he is a very clever boy , indeed . They are all remarkably clever ; and they have so many pretty ways . They will come and stand by my chair , and say , ` Grandpapa , can you give me a bit of string ? ' and once Henry asked me for a knife , but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas . I think their father is too rough with them very often . "
30936	30943	30945	30945	Emma	128	" He appears rough to you , "
30947	31022	30945	30945	Emma	128	" because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough . He wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father . The children are all fond of him . "
31023	31044	30653	30653	she	128	" And then their uncle comes in , and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way ! "
31045	31093	30945	30945	Emma	128	" But they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much . It is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other . "
31094	31103	30653	30653	she	128	" Well , I can not understand it . "
31104	31129	30945	30945	Emma	128	" That is the case with us all , papa . One half of the world can not understand the pleasures of the other . "
31350	31416	31347	31347	she	128	" Oh ! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it . We admired it so much , that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith 's collection . Your friend will not take it amiss I hope . Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines . "
31440	31441	31429	31429	He	843	" honour,"--glanced
31482	31522	31478	31478	Emma	128	" You must make my apologies to your friend ; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two . He may be sure of every woman 's approbation while he writes with such gallantry . "
31523	31531	31533	31534	Mr. Elton	100	" I have no hesitation in saying , "
31545	31616	31533	31534	Mr. Elton	100	" I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as _ I _ do -- I have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _ I _ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ) , he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life . "
31874	31892	31893	31893	Harriet	115	" There it is . There go you and your riddle - book one of these days . "--
31896	31916	31893	31893	Harriet	115	" Oh , what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much . "
31917	31929	31931	31931	Emma	128	" I do not often walk this way _ now _ , "
31937	31971	31931	31931	Emma	128	" but _ then _ there will be an inducement , and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges , gates , pools and pollards of this part of Highbury . "
32027	32035	32037	32037	she	115	" I wish we could contrive it , "
32039	32069	32037	32037	she	115	" but I can not think of any tolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father . "
32091	32117	32087	32087	Harriet	115	" I do so wonder , Miss Woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married ! so charming as you are!"--
32124	32180	32118	32118	Emma	128	" My being charming , Harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; I must find other people charming -- one other person at least . And I am not only , not going to be married , at present , but have very little intention of ever marrying at all . "
32181	32193	32087	32087	Harriet	115	" Ah!--so you say ; but I can not believe it . "
32194	32272	32118	32118	Emma	128	" I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet , to be tempted ; Mr. Elton , you know , ( recollecting herself , ) is out of the question : and I do _ not _ wish to see any such person . I would rather not be tempted . I can not really change for the better . If I were to marry , I must expect to repent it . "
32273	32284	32087	32087	Harriet	115	" Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!"--
32285	32435	32118	32118	Emma	128	" I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry . Were I to fall in love , indeed , it would be a different thing ! but I never have been in love ; it is not my way , or my nature ; and I do not think I ever shall . And , without love , I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine . Fortune I do not want ; employment I do not want ; consequence I do not want : I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband 's house as I am of Hartfield ; and never , never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man 's eyes as I am in my father 's . "
32436	32452	32087	32087	Harriet	115	" But then , to be an old maid at last , like Miss Bates ! "
32453	32536	32118	32118	Emma	128	" That is as formidable an image as you could present , Harriet ; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates ! so silly -- so satisfied-- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious-- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , I would marry to - morrow . But between _ us _ , I am convinced there never can be any likeness , except in being unmarried . "
32537	32554	32087	32087	Harriet	115	" But still , you will be an old maid ! and that 's so dreadful ! "
32555	32798	32118	32118	Emma	128	" Never mind , Harriet , I shall not be a poor old maid ; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public ! A single woman , with a very narrow income , must be a ridiculous , disagreeable old maid ! the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else . And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first ; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind , and sour the temper . Those who can barely live , and who live perforce in a very small , and generally very inferior , society , may well be illiberal and cross . This does not apply , however , to Miss Bates ; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me ; but , in general , she is very much to the taste of every body , though single and though poor . Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind : I really believe , if she had only a shilling in the world , she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it ; and nobody is afraid of her : that is a great charm . "
32799	32819	32087	32087	Harriet	115	" Dear me ! but what shall you do ? how shall you employ yourself when you grow old ? "
32820	33054	32118	32118	Emma	128	" If I know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty . Woman 's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now ; or with no important variation . If I draw less , I shall read more ; if I give up music , I shall take to carpet - work . And as for objects of interest , objects for the affections , which is in truth the great point of inferiority , the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in _ not _ marrying , I shall be very well off , with all the children of a sister I love so much , to care about . There will be enough of them , in all probability , to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need . There will be enough for every hope and every fear ; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent , it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder . My nephews and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me . "
33055	33083	32087	32087	Harriet	115	" Do you know Miss Bates 's niece ? That is , I know you must have seen her a hundred times -- but are you acquainted ? "
33084	33229	32118	32118	Emma	128	" Oh ! yes ; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury . By the bye , _ that _ is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece . Heaven forbid ! at least , that I should ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together , as she does about Jane Fairfax . One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax . Every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month . I wish Jane Fairfax very well ; but she tires me to death . "
33385	33442	33362	33362	she	128	" These are the sights , Harriet , to do one good . How trifling they make every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day ; and yet , who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind ? "
33443	33447	33449	33449	Harriet	115	" Very true , "
33451	33462	33449	33449	Harriet	115	" Poor creatures ! one can think of nothing else . "
33463	33478	33480	33480	Emma	128	" And really , I do not think the impression will soon be over , "
33512	33520	33483	33483	she	128	" I do not think it will , "
33542	33549	33551	33552	her companion	686	" Oh ! dear , no , "
33592	33670	33572	33573	Mr. Elton	100	" Ah ! Harriet , here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts . Well , ( smiling , ) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important . If we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves . "
33676	33683	33685	33686	the gentleman	694	" Oh ! dear , yes , "
33750	33764	33766	33766	Emma	128	" To fall in with each other on such an errand as this , "
33768	33817	33766	33766	Emma	128	" to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring a great increase of love on each side . I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration . It must , if I were not here . I wish I were anywhere else . "
34240	34253	34255	34255	her	128	" This would soon have led to something better , of course , "
34259	34291	34255	34255	her	128	" any thing interests between those who love ; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart . If I could but have kept longer away ! "
34388	34396	34398	34398	she	128	" Part of my lace is gone , "
34400	34470	34398	34398	she	128	" and I do not know how I am to contrive . I really am a most troublesome companion to you both , but I hope I am not often so ill - equipped . Mr. Elton , I must beg leave to stop at your house , and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string , or any thing just to keep my boot on . "
34737	34743	34745	34745	Emma	128	" Cautious , very cautious , "
34747	34764	34745	34745	Emma	128	" he advances inch by inch , and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure . "
35910	35916	35918	35918	he	91	" Ah , my dear , "
35920	35931	35918	35918	he	91	" poor Miss Taylor -- It is a grievous business . "
35932	35938	35940	35940	she	2732	" Oh yes , sir , "
35945	35994	35940	35940	she	2732	" how you must miss her ! And dear Emma , too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!-- I have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she is pretty well , sir . "
35995	36019	35918	35918	he	91	" Pretty well , my dear -- I hope -- pretty well.--I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably . "
36038	36070	35918	35918	he	91	" Oh ! no -- none in the least . I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life-- never looking so well . Papa is only speaking his own regret . "
36071	36080	35918	35918	he	91	" Very much to the honour of both , "
36086	36098	36100	36100	Isabella	93	" And do you see her , sir , tolerably often ? "
36113	36126	36111	36112	Mr. Woodhouse	91	hesitated.--"Not near so often , my dear , as I could wish . "
36127	36278	36111	36112	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Oh ! papa , we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married . Either in the morning or evening of every day , excepting one , have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston , and generally both , either at Randalls or here -- and as you may suppose , Isabella , most frequently here . They are very , very kind in their visits . Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself . Papa , if you speak in that melancholy way , you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all . Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed , but every body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated -- which is the exact truth . "
36279	36286	36288	36290	Mr. John Knightley	97	" Just as it should be , "
36292	36371	36288	36290	Mr. John Knightley	97	" and just as I hoped it was from your letters . Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy . I have been always telling you , my love , that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have Emma 's account , I hope you will be satisfied . "
36372	36379	36381	36382	Mr. Woodhouse--"yes	160	" Why , to be sure , "
36382	36417	36381	36382	Mr. Woodhouse--"yes	160	Woodhouse--"yes , certainly -- I can not deny that Mrs. Weston , poor Mrs. Weston , does come and see us pretty often-- but then -- she is always obliged to go away again . "
36418	36440	36111	36112	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not , papa.-- You quite forget poor Mr. Weston . "
36441	36447	36449	36450	John Knightley	97	" I think , indeed , "
36453	36533	36449	36450	John Knightley	97	" that Mr. Weston has some little claim . You and I , Emma , will venture to take the part of the poor husband . I , being a husband , and you not being a wife , the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force . As for Isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can . "
36534	36540	36542	36543	his wife	2772	" Me , my love , "
36551	36744	36449	36450	John Knightley	97	" Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be , or can be , a greater advocate for matrimony than I am ; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield , I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world ; and as to slighting Mr. Weston , that excellent Mr. Weston , I think there is nothing he does not deserve . I believe he is one of the very best - tempered men that ever existed . Excepting yourself and your brother , I do not know his equal for temper . I shall never forget his flying Henry 's kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o'clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham , I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him , it must be Miss Taylor . "
36745	36752	36754	36755	John Knightley	97	" Where is the young man ? "
36757	36771	36754	36755	John Knightley	97	" Has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not ? "
36772	36780	36782	36782	Emma	128	" He has not been here yet , "
36784	36813	36782	36782	Emma	128	" There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage , but it ended in nothing ; and I have not heard him mentioned lately . "
36814	36827	36829	36830	her father	434	" But you should tell them of the letter , my dear , "
36832	36896	36829	36830	her father	434	" He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston , to congratulate her , and a very proper , handsome letter it was . She shewed it to me . I thought it very well done of him indeed . Whether it was his own idea you know , one can not tell . He is but young , and his uncle , perhaps-- "
36897	36916	36782	36782	Emma	128	" My dear papa , he is three - and - twenty . You forget how time passes . "
36917	37027	36829	36830	her father	434	" Three - and - twenty!--is he indeed?--Well , I could not have thought it-- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother ! Well , time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad . However , it was an exceeding good , pretty letter , and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of pleasure . I remember it was written from Weymouth , and dated Sept. 28th -- and began , ` My dear Madam , ' but I forget how it went on ; and it was signed ` F. C. Weston Churchill . '-- I remember that perfectly . "
37028	37037	37039	37045	the good - hearted Mrs. John Knightley	127	" How very pleasing and proper of him ! "
37047	37134	37039	37045	the good - hearted Mrs. John Knightley	127	" I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man . But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father ! There is something so shocking in a child 's being taken away from his parents and natural home ! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with him . To give up one 's child ! I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else . "
37135	37148	37150	37152	Mr. John Knightley	97	" Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills , I fancy , "
37155	37263	37150	37152	Mr. John Knightley	97	" But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John . Mr. Weston is rather an easy , cheerful - tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , I suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords . "
37655	37698	37649	37649	he	97	" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces . As to men and women , our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard to these children , I observe we never disagree . "
37699	37747	37649	37649	he	97	" If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women , and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them , as you are where these children are concerned , we might always think alike . "
37748	37765	37649	37649	he	97	" To be sure -- our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong . "
37766	37769	37771	37771	he	963	" Yes , "
37773	37787	37771	37771	he	963	smiling--"and reason good . I was sixteen years old when you were born . "
37788	37794	37649	37649	he	97	" A material difference then , "
37796	37833	37771	37771	he	963	replied--"and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one - and - twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ? "
37834	37844	37649	37649	he	97	" Yes -- a good deal _ nearer _ . "
37845	37866	37771	37771	he	963	" But still , not near enough to give me a chance of being right , if we think differently . "
37867	37948	37649	37649	he	97	" I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child . Come , my dear Emma , let us be friends , and say no more about it . Tell your aunt , little Emma , that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances , and that if she were not wrong before , she is now . "
37949	37954	37771	37771	he	963	" That 's true , "
37956	38044	37649	37649	he	97	cried--"very true . Little Emma , grow up a better woman than your aunt . Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited . Now , Mr. Knightley , a word or two more , and I have done . As far as good intentions went , we were _ both _ right , and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong . I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very , very bitterly disappointed . "
38045	38054	38056	38056	his	965	" A man can not be more so , "
38062	38074	37649	37649	he	97	" Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come , shake hands with me . "
38093	38100	38086	38087	John Knightley	97	" How d'ye do , George ? "
38102	38109	37649	37649	he	97	" John , how are you ? "
38448	38454	38456	38456	he	91	" My poor dear Isabella , "
38480	38547	38456	38456	he	91	children--"How long it is , how terribly long since you were here ! And how tired you must be after your journey ! You must go to bed early , my dear -- and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together . My dear Emma , suppose we all have a little gruel . "
38616	38648	38604	38604	he	156	" It was an awkward business , my dear , your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here . I never had much opinion of the sea air . "
38649	38690	38604	38604	he	156	" Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it , sir -- or we should not have gone . He recommended it for all the children , but particularly for the weakness in little Bella 's throat,-- both sea air and bathing . "
38691	38752	38604	38604	he	156	" Ah ! my dear , but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good ; and as to myself , I have been long perfectly convinced , though perhaps I never told you so before , that the sea is very rarely of use to any body . I am sure it almost killed me once . "
38753	38758	38760	38760	Emma	128	" Come , come , "
38770	38827	38760	38760	Emma	128	" I must beg you not to talk of the sea . It makes me envious and miserable;-- I who have never seen it ! South End is prohibited , if you please . My dear Isabella , I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet ; and he never forgets you . "
38828	38841	38604	38604	he	156	" Oh ! good Mr. Perry -- how is he , sir ? "
38842	38921	38760	38760	Emma	128	" Why , pretty well ; but not quite well . Poor Perry is bilious , and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country . I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere . But then there is not so clever a man any where . "
38922	38967	38604	38604	he	156	" And Mrs. Perry and the children , how are they ? do the children grow ? I have a great regard for Mr. Perry . I hope he will be calling soon . He will be so pleased to see my little ones . "
38968	39016	38760	38760	Emma	128	" I hope he will be here to - morrow , for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence . And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella 's throat . "
39017	39077	38604	38604	he	156	" Oh ! my dear sir , her throat is so much better that I have hardly any uneasiness about it . Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr. Wingfield 's , which we have been applying at times ever since August . "
39078	39113	38760	38760	Emma	128	" It is not very likely , my dear , that bathing should have been of use to her -- and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation , I would have spoken to--
39114	39127	39129	39129	Emma	128	" You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates , "
39131	39141	39129	39129	Emma	128	" I have not heard one inquiry after them . "
39142	39213	38760	38760	Emma	128	" Oh ! the good Bateses -- I am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters . I hope they are quite well . Good old Mrs. Bates -- I will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.-- And that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!-- How are they , sir ? "
39214	39240	39129	39129	Emma	128	" Why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole . But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago . "
39241	39284	38760	38760	Emma	128	" How sorry I am ! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn . Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy -- except when it has been quite an influenza . "
39285	39339	39129	39129	Emma	128	" That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention . Perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November . Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season . "
39340	39356	38760	38760	Emma	128	" No , I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _ very _ sickly except--
39357	39411	39129	39129	Emma	128	" Ah ! my poor dear child , the truth is , that in London it is always a sickly season . Nobody is healthy in London , nobody can be . It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there ! so far off!-- and the air so bad ! "
39412	39526	38760	38760	Emma	128	" No , indeed--_we _ are not at all in a bad air . Our part of London is very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London in general , my dear sir . The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest . We are so very airy ! I should be unwilling , I own , to live in any other part of the town;-- there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in : but _ we _ are so remarkably airy!--Mr . Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air . "
39527	39590	39129	39129	Emma	128	" Ah ! my dear , it is not like Hartfield . You make the best of it-- but after you have been a week at Hartfield , you are all of you different creatures ; you do not look like the same . Now I can not say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present . "
39591	39723	38760	38760	Emma	128	" I am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but I assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere , I am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming . I hope you will think better of their looks to - morrow ; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case . I trust , at least , that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill , "
39734	39757	39129	39129	Emma	128	" Middling , my dear ; I can not compliment you . I think Mr. John Knightley very far from looking well . "
39758	39770	39772	39774	Mr. John Knightley	97	" What is the matter , sir?--Did you speak to me ? "
39781	39835	39840	39840	he	97	" I am sorry to find , my love , that my father does not think you looking well -- but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued . I could have wished , however , as you know , that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you left home . "
39836	39839	39840	39840	he	97	" My dear Isabella,"--exclaimed
39841	39869	39840	39840	he	97	hastily--"pray do not concern yourself about my looks . Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children , and let me look as I chuse . "
39870	39883	39885	39885	Emma	128	" I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother , "
39887	39923	39885	39885	Emma	128	" about your friend Mr. Graham 's intending to have a bailiff from Scotland , to look after his new estate . What will it answer ? Will not the old prejudice be too strong ? "
39989	39997	39999	40001	Mrs. John Knightley.--	166	" That sweet , amiable Jane Fairfax ! "
40002	40097	39999	40001	Mrs. John Knightley.--	166	" It is so long since I have seen her , except now and then for a moment accidentally in town ! What happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt , when she comes to visit them ! I always regret excessively on dear Emma 's account that she can not be more at Highbury ; but now their daughter is married , I suppose Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all . She would be such a delightful companion for Emma . "
40108	40142	40098	40099	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Our little friend Harriet Smith , however , is just such another pretty kind of young person . You will like Harriet . Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet . "
40143	40170	39999	40001	Mrs. John Knightley.--	166	" I am most happy to hear it -- but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma 's age . "
40337	40340	40346	40346	his	91	" Ah ! "
40364	40389	40346	40346	his	91	" Ah ! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End . It does not bear talking of . "
40436	40457	40432	40432	he	91	" I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn , instead of coming here . "
40458	40480	40432	40432	he	91	" But why should you be sorry , sir?--I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good . "
40481	40523	40432	40432	he	91	" And , moreover , if you must go to the sea , it had better not have been to South End . South End is an unhealthy place . Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End . "
40524	40608	40432	40432	he	91	" I know there is such an idea with many people , but indeed it is quite a mistake , sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there , never found the least inconvenience from the mud ; and Mr. Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy ; and I am sure he may be depended on , for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air , and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly . "
40609	40696	40432	40432	he	91	" You should have gone to Cromer , my dear , if you went anywhere.-- Perry was a week at Cromer once , and he holds it to be the best of all the sea - bathing places . A fine open sea , he says , and very pure air . And , by what I understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable . You should have consulted Perry . "
40697	40725	40432	40432	he	91	" But , my dear sir , the difference of the journey;--only consider how great it would have been.--An hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty . "
40726	40806	40432	40432	he	91	" Ah ! my dear , as Perry says , where health is at stake , nothing else should be considered ; and if one is to travel , there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all , better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air . This is just what Perry said . It seemed to him a very ill - judged measure . "
40844	40848	40850	40850	he	434	" Mr. Perry , "
40860	40931	40932	40932	He	434	" would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for . Why does he make it any business of his , to wonder at what I do?-- at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed , I hope , the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.-- I want his directions no more than his drugs . "
40948	40999	40932	40932	He	434	" If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty , I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself . "
41000	41005	41007	41008	Mr. Knightley	97	" True , true , "
41014	41150	41007	41008	Mr. Knightley	97	" very true . That 's a consideration indeed.--But John , as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , I can not conceive any difficulty . I should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path . . . . The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps . I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion . "
41851	41903	41840	41840	Emma	128	" a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them . "
41917	41970	41914	41914	he	100	" A sore - throat!--I hope not infectious . I hope not of a putrid infectious sort . Has Perry seen her ? Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend . Let me entreat you to run no risks . Why does not Perry see her ? "
42037	42200	42026	42026	she	128	" It is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston . But , upon my word , Mr. Elton , in your case , I should certainly excuse myself . You appear to me a little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to - morrow will bring , I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to - night . "
42298	42306	42262	42262	Emma	128	" very cold , certainly very cold , "
42336	42342	42262	42262	Emma	128	" You do quite right , "
42344	42355	42359	42359	she	128	she;--"we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston . "
42446	42449	42451	42451	she	128	" Well , "
42455	42608	42451	42451	she	128	" this is most strange!--After I had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination-- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with Mr. Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with Harriet ; but still , he can not refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked . What a strange thing love is ! he can see ready wit in Harriet , but will not dine alone for her . "
42729	42779	42725	42726	John Knightley	97	" I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr. Elton . It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned . With men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works . "
42780	42789	42791	42791	Emma	128	" Mr. Elton 's manners are not perfect , "
42793	42857	42791	42791	Emma	128	" but where there is a wish to please , one ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great deal . Where a man does his best with only moderate powers , he will have the advantage over negligent superiority . There is such perfect good - temper and good - will in Mr. Elton as one can not but value . "
42858	42861	42863	42865	Mr. John Knightley	97	" Yes , "
42872	42887	42863	42865	Mr. John Knightley	97	" he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you . "
42888	42891	42892	42892	she	128	" Me ! "
42900	42912	42892	42892	she	128	" are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton 's object ? "
42913	42945	42863	42865	Mr. John Knightley	97	" Such an imagination has crossed me , I own , Emma ; and if it never occurred to you before , you may as well take it into consideration now . "
42946	42956	42892	42892	she	128	" Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea ! "
42957	43023	42863	42865	Mr. John Knightley	97	" I do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly . I think your manners to him encouraging . I speak as a friend , Emma . You had better look about you , and ascertain what you do , and what you mean to do . "
43024	43051	43053	43053	she	1020	" I thank you ; but I assure you you are quite mistaken . Mr. Elton and I are very good friends , and nothing more ; "
43356	43360	43362	43362	he	91	" A man , "
43364	43622	43362	43362	he	91	" must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him . He must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; I could not do such a thing . It is the greatest absurdity -- Actually snowing at this moment!-- The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people 's not staying comfortably at home when they can ! If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it;--and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man 's house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow . Going in dismal weather , to return probably in worse;--four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle , shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home . "
43649	43656	43627	43627	herself	128	" Very true , my love , "
43810	43817	43798	43798	She	128	" Much the same-- not better . "
43818	43828	43830	43830	she	128	" _ My _ report from Mrs. Goddard 's , "
43833	43850	43830	43830	she	128	" was not so pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better ' was _ my _ answer . "
43868	43957	43857	43857	his	100	" Oh ! no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard 's door , which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress , I was told that Miss Smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse . Very much grieved and concerned-- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning . "
43961	44008	43958	43958	Emma	128	answered--"My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , I hope ; but not even I can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed . Mr. Perry has been with her , as you probably heard . "
44009	44021	43857	43857	his	100	" Yes -- I imagined -- that is -- I did not-- "
44022	44069	43958	43958	Emma	128	" He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report . But it is impossible not to feel uneasiness . Such a sad loss to our party to - day ! "
44070	44081	43857	43857	his	100	" Dreadful!--Exactly so , indeed.--She will be missed every moment . "
44133	44139	44141	44141	he	1034	" What an excellent device , "
44143	44233	44141	44141	he	1034	" the use of a sheepskin for carriages . How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel cold with such precautions . The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman 's carriage perfectly complete . One is so fenced and guarded from the weather , that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted . Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence . It is a very cold afternoon -- but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.--Ha ! snows a little I see . "
44234	44237	44239	44240	John Knightley	97	" Yes , "
44242	44255	44239	44240	John Knightley	97	" and I think we shall have a good deal of it . "
44256	44260	44262	44263	Mr. Elton	100	" Christmas weather , "
44265	44389	44262	44263	Mr. Elton	100	" Quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day 's party , which it might very possibly have done , for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence . This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings . At Christmas every body invites their friends about them , and people think little of even the worst weather . I was snowed up at a friend 's house once for a week . Nothing could be pleasanter . I went for only one night , and could not get away till that very day se'nnight . "
44409	44423	44396	44396	he	97	" I can not wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls . "
44461	44469	44471	44471	he	97	" We are sure of excellent fires , "
44473	44622	44471	44471	he	97	" and every thing in the greatest comfort . Charming people , Mr. and Mrs. Weston;-- Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society;-- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any . Mr. Weston 's dining - room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , I would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two . I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma , ) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr. Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings . "
44623	44643	44760	44762	Mr. John Knightley	97	" I know nothing of the large parties of London , sir -- I never dine with any body . "
44644	44698	44471	44471	he	97	" Indeed ! ( in a tone of wonder and pity , ) I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery . Well , sir , the time must come when you will be paid for all this , when you will have little labour and great enjoyment . "
44699	44704	44706	44707	John Knightley	97	" My first enjoyment , "
44718	44729	44706	44707	John Knightley	97	" will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again . "
45212	45241	45199	45199	his	100	" Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!"--
45395	45399	45381	45382	Mr. Weston	92	" my son , "
45401	45404	45381	45382	Mr. Weston	92	" Frank , "
45406	45410	45429	45429	he	100	" my son , "
45782	45864	45753	45753	he	100	" We want only two more to be just the right number . I should like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend , Miss Smith , and my son -- and then I should say we were quite complete . I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting Frank . I had a letter from him this morning , and he will be with us within a fortnight . "
45894	45904	45906	45907	Mr. Weston	92	" He has been wanting to come to us , "
45909	45976	45906	45907	Mr. Weston	92	" ever since September : every letter has been full of it ; but he can not command his own time . He has those to please who must be pleased , and who ( between ourselves ) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices . But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January . "
45977	46011	45879	45879	his	1054	" What a very great pleasure it will be to you ! and Mrs. Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him , that she must be almost as happy as yourself . "
46012	46276	45906	45907	Mr. Weston	92	" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off . She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do . The case , you see , is--(but this is quite between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room . There are secrets in all families , you know)--The case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January ; and that Frank 's coming depends upon their being put off . If they are not put off , he can not stir . But I know they will , because it is a family that a certain lady , of some consequence , at Enscombe , has a particular dislike to : and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years , they always are put off when it comes to the point . I have not the smallest doubt of the issue . I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January , as I am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at Hartfield , that she can not calculate on their effects , as I have been long in the practice of doing . "
46277	46292	46294	46294	Emma	128	" I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case , "
46296	46326	46294	46294	Emma	128	" but am disposed to side with you , Mr. Weston . If you think he will come , I shall think so too ; for you know Enscombe . "
46327	46484	46485	46485	Emma	128	" Yes -- I have some right to that knowledge ; though I have never been at the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow myself to speak ill of her , on Frank 's account ; for I do believe her to be very fond of him . I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body , except herself : but she has always been kind to him ( in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices , and expecting every thing to be as she likes ) . And it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though I would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper . "
46561	46611	46539	46539	she	169	" for I can not depend upon his coming . I can not be so sanguine as Mr. Weston . I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing . Mr. Weston , I dare say , has been telling you exactly how the matter stands ? "
46612	46643	46539	46539	she	169	" Yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of Mrs. Churchill , which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world . "
46644	46648	46650	46651	Mrs. Weston	169	" My Emma ! "
46655	46663	46650	46651	Mrs. Weston	169	" what is the certainty of caprice ? "
46674	46768	46539	46539	she	169	before--"You must know , my dear Mrs. Knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks . It depends entirely upon his aunt 's spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper . To you -- to my two daughters -- I may venture on the truth . Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe , and is a very odd - tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends upon her being willing to spare him . "
46769	46781	46783	46783	Isabella	93	" Oh , Mrs. Churchill ; every body knows Mrs. Churchill , "
46785	46862	46783	46783	Isabella	93	" and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion . To be constantly living with an ill - tempered person , must be dreadful . It is what we happily have never known any thing of ; but it must be a life of misery . What a blessing , that she never had any children ! Poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them ! "
47019	47065	47012	47012	Emma	128	" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain . I am sorry for it . The introduction must be unpleasant , whenever it takes place ; and the sooner it could be over , the better . "
47066	47173	47012	47012	Emma	128	" Yes ; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays . Even if this family , the Braithwaites , are put off , I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us . I can not bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves . There is jealousy . They are jealous even of his regard for his father . In short , I can feel no dependence on his coming , and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine . "
47174	47180	47182	47182	Emma	128	" He ought to come , "
47184	47286	47182	47182	Emma	128	" If he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man 's not having it in his power to do as much as that . A young _ woman _ , if she fall into bad hands , may be teazed , and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with ; but one can not comprehend a young _ man _ 's being under such restraint , as not to be able to spend a week with his father , if he likes it . "
47287	47312	47314	47315	Mrs. Weston	169	" One ought to be at Enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do , "
47317	47373	47314	47315	Mrs. Weston	169	" One ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but Enscombe , I believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _ she _ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her . "
47374	47455	47182	47182	Emma	128	" But she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite . Now , according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _ him _ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all . "
47456	47525	47314	47315	Mrs. Weston	169	" My dearest Emma , do not pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a bad one , or to lay down rules for it : you must let it go its own way . I have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _ when _ it will be . "
47534	47545	47526	47526	Emma	128	" I shall not be satisfied , unless he comes . "
47546	47559	47561	47562	Mrs. Weston	169	" He may have a great deal of influence on some points , "
47564	47605	47561	47562	Mrs. Weston	169	" and on others , very little : and among those , on which she is beyond his reach , it is but too likely , may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us . "
47812	47846	47795	47795	He	100	" Did she know?--had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably . "
48084	48143	48074	48074	He	100	" Would not she give him her support?--would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard 's till it were certain that Miss Smith 's disorder had no infection ? He could not be satisfied without a promise-- would not she give him her influence in procuring it ? "
48144	48150	48151	48151	he	100	" So scrupulous for others , "
48154	48221	48151	48151	he	100	" and yet so careless for herself ! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to - day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself . Is this fair , Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us . Have not I some right to complain ? I am sure of your kind support and aid . "
48400	48432	48397	48398	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir . Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow . "
48501	48511	48513	48513	he	91	" I admired your resolution very much , sir , "
48515	48614	48513	48513	he	91	" in venturing out in such weather , for of course you saw there would be snow very soon . Every body must have seen the snow coming on . I admired your spirit ; and I dare say we shall get home very well . Another hour or two 's snow can hardly make the road impassable ; and we are two carriages ; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand . I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight . "
48776	48791	48802	48802	he	91	" What is to be done , my dear Emma?--what is to be done ? "
48944	48956	48958	48958	she	2772	" You had better order the carriage directly , my love , "
48960	49040	48958	48958	she	2772	" I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk . I am not at all afraid . I should not mind walking half the way . I could change my shoes , you know , the moment I got home ; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold . "
49041	49044	49046	49046	he	450	" Indeed ! "
49048	49099	49046	49046	he	450	" Then , my dear Isabella , it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world , for in general every thing does give you cold . Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home , I dare say . It will be bad enough for the horses . "
49411	49425	49390	49391	the others	887	" Your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ? "
49426	49436	49390	49391	the others	887	" I am ready , if the others are . "
49437	49444	49390	49391	the others	887	" Shall I ring the bell ? "
49445	49450	49390	49391	the others	887	" Yes , do . "
49572	49625	49627	49627	James	95	" He was afraid they should have a very bad drive . He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it . And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind . He did not know what they had best do . They must keep as much together as they could ; "
50074	50126	50071	50071	she	128	" I am very much astonished , Mr. Elton . This to _ me _ ! you forget yourself-- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _ me _ , if you please . "
50127	50136	50138	50138	he	100	" Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly mean!"--
50163	50224	50155	50155	she	128	" Mr. Elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct ! and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner . Command yourself enough to say no more , and I will endeavour to forget it . "
50331	50439	50313	50313	she	128	" It is impossible for me to doubt any longer . You have made yourself too clear . Mr. Elton , my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express . After such behaviour , as I have witnessed during the last month , to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible ! Believe me , sir , I am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions . "
50440	50444	50446	50447	Mr. Elton	100	" Good Heaven ! "
50449	50628	50446	50447	Mr. Elton	100	" what can be the meaning of this?-- Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend . If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed!--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse ! who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near ! No , upon my honour , there is no unsteadiness of character . I have thought only of you . I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else . Every thing that I have said or done , for many weeks past , has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself . You can not really , seriously , doubt it . No!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me . "
50692	50714	50689	50689	he	100	" Charming Miss Woodhouse ! allow me to interpret this interesting silence . It confesses that you have long understood me . "
50715	50720	50722	50722	Emma	128	" No , sir , "
50724	50869	50722	50722	Emma	128	" it confesses no such thing . So far from having long understood you , I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views , till this moment . As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings-- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared , ) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent . Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought seriously of her ? "
50870	50875	50877	50877	he	1114	" Never , madam , "
50884	51002	50877	50877	he	1114	" never , I assure you . _ I _ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl ; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled . I wish her extremely well : and , no doubt , there are men who might not object to -- Every body has their level : but as for myself , I am not , I think , quite so much at a loss . I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!-- No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received-- "
51003	51135	51145	51145	her	1116	" Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it . I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend . In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance . I am exceedingly sorry : but it is well that the mistake ends where it does . Had the same behaviour continued , Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views ; not being aware , probably , any more than myself , of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of . But , as it is , the disappointment is single , and , I trust , will not be lasting . I have no thoughts of matrimony at present . "
51594	51625	51635	51635	he	1125	" If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man , I could have borne any thing . He might have doubled his presumption to me-- but poor Harriet ! "
51736	51738	51719	51719	they	1126	" ready wit"--but
51741	51743	51704	51704	he	1125	" soft eyes"--
52685	52690	52692	52692	she	1142	" Here have I , "
52694	52904	52692	52692	she	1142	" actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man . She might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if I had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him . Oh ! that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin . There I was quite right . That was well done of me ; but there I should have stopped , and left the rest to time and chance . I was introducing her into good company , and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having ; I ought not to have attempted more . But now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time . I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _ not _ to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her;--William Coxe -- Oh ! no , I could not endure William Coxe-- a pert young lawyer . "
53466	53484	53452	53452	him	100	" Ah ! Mr. Knightley , why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton ? "
53758	53849	53752	53753	Mr. Elton	100	" that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense-- and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them . "
54980	55004	55005	55006	Mrs. Weston	169	" very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period . "
55445	55454	55456	55457	Mr. Knightley	97	" The Churchills are very likely in fault , "
55461	55473	55456	55457	Mr. Knightley	97	" but I dare say he might come if he would . "
55474	55501	55420	55420	she	128	" I do not know why you should say so . He wishes exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him . "
55502	55537	55456	55457	Mr. Knightley	97	" I can not believe that he has not the power of coming , if he made a point of it . It is too unlikely , for me to believe it without proof . "
55538	55561	55420	55420	she	128	" How odd you are ! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ? "
55562	55706	55456	55457	Mr. Knightley	97	" I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions , and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure , from living with those who have always set him the example of it . It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too . If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between September and January . A man at his age -- what is he?--three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that . It is impossible . "
55707	55758	55420	55420	she	128	" That 's easily said , and easily felt by you , who have always been your own master . You are the worst judge in the world , Mr. Knightley , of the difficulties of dependence . You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage . "
55759	55866	55456	55457	Mr. Knightley	97	" It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four - and - twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount . He can not want money -- he can not want leisure . We know , on the contrary , that he has so much of both , that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom . We hear of him for ever at some watering - place or other . A little while ago , he was at Weymouth . This proves that he can leave the Churchills . "
55867	55874	55420	55420	she	128	" Yes , sometimes he can . "
55875	55896	55456	55457	Mr. Knightley	97	" And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while ; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure . "
55897	55992	55420	55420	she	128	" It is very unfair to judge of any body 's conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation . Nobody , who has not been in the interior of a family , can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be . We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe , and with Mrs. Churchill 's temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do . He may , at times , be able to do a great deal more than he can at others . "
55993	56179	55456	55457	Mr. Knightley	97	" There is one thing , Emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution . It is Frank Churchill 's duty to pay this attention to his father . He knows it to be so , by his promises and messages ; but if he wished to do it , it might be done . A man who felt rightly would say at once , simply and resolutely , to Mrs. Churchill-- ` Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience ; but I must go and see my father immediately . I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion . I shall , therefore , set off to - morrow . '-- If he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going . "
56180	56183	56185	56185	Emma	128	" No , "
56189	56297	56185	56185	Emma	128	" but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again . Such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use!--Nobody but you , Mr. Knightley , would imagine it possible . But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own . Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable ? "
56298	56503	55456	55457	Mr. Knightley	97	" Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it . He would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration -- made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner-- would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do . Respect would be added to affection . They would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims . Respect for right conduct is felt by every body . If he would act in this sort of manner , on principle , consistently , regularly , their little minds would bend to his . "
56504	56703	56185	56185	Emma	128	" I rather doubt that . You are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , I think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones . I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr. Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill 's situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect . The Churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through . To him who has , it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence , and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought . He may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it . "
56704	56731	55456	55457	Mr. Knightley	97	" Then it would not be so strong a sense . If it failed to produce equal exertion , it could not be an equal conviction . "
56732	56779	56185	56185	Emma	128	" Oh , the difference of situation and habit ! I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life . "
56780	56907	55456	55457	Mr. Knightley	97	" Our amiable young man is a very weak young man , if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others . It ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency . I can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man . As he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority . He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father . Had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now . "
56908	56916	56918	56918	Emma	128	" We shall never agree about him , "
56920	57013	56918	56918	Emma	128	" but that is nothing extraordinary . I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : I feel sure that he is not . Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly , though in his own son ; but he is very likely to have a more yielding , complying , mild disposition than would suit your notions of man 's perfection . I dare say he has ; and though it may cut him off from some advantages , it will secure him many others . "
57014	57103	55456	55457	Mr. Knightley	97	" Yes ; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move , and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure , and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it . He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father 's having any right to complain . His letters disgust me . "
57104	57118	56918	56918	Emma	128	" Your feelings are singular . They seem to satisfy every body else . "
57119	57292	55456	55457	Mr. Knightley	97	" I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston . They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother 's place , but without a mother 's affection to blind her . It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due , and she must doubly feel the omission . Had she been a person of consequence herself , he would have come I dare say ; and it would not have signified whether he did or no . Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ? No , Emma , your amiable young man can be amiable only in French , not in English . He may be very ` aimable , ' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him . "
57293	57303	56918	56918	Emma	128	" You seem determined to think ill of him . "
57304	57309	57311	57312	Mr. Knightley	97	" Me!--not at all , "
57317	57371	57311	57312	Mr. Knightley	97	" I do not want to think ill of him . I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but I hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners . "
57372	57480	56918	56918	Emma	128	" Well , if he have nothing else to recommend him , he will be a treasure at Highbury . We do not often look upon fine young men , well - bred and agreeable . We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain . Can not you imagine , Mr. Knightley , what a _ sensation _ his coming will produce ? There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury ; but one interest-- one object of curiosity ; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill ; we shall think and speak of nobody else . "
57481	57527	57311	57312	Mr. Knightley	97	" You will excuse my being so much over - powered . If I find him conversable , I shall be glad of his acquaintance ; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb , he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts . "
57528	57628	56918	56918	Emma	128	" My idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable . To you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him . "
57629	57633	57635	57636	Mr. Knightley	97	" And mine , "
57639	57748	57635	57636	Mr. Knightley	97	" is , that if he turn out any thing like it , he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing ! What ! at three - and - twenty to be the king of his company -- the great man-- the practised politician , who is to read every body 's character , and make every body 's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority ; to be dispensing his flatteries around , that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself ! My dear Emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point . "
57749	57758	57760	57760	Emma	128	" I will say no more about him , "
57762	57795	57760	57760	Emma	128	" you turn every thing to evil . We are both prejudiced ; you against , I for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here . "
57796	57804	57635	57636	Mr. Knightley	97	" Prejudiced ! I am not prejudiced . "
57805	57837	57760	57760	Emma	128	" But I am very much , and without being at all ashamed of it . My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour . "
57838	57855	57857	57858	Mr. Knightley	97	" He is a person I never think of from one month 's end to another , "
58056	58066	58067	58067	she	128	" Mr. Elton is so good to the poor ! "
58411	58484	58498	58499	Mr. Elton	100	beaufet--"Mrs . Cole had just been there , just called in for ten minutes , and had been so good as to sit an hour with them , and _ she _ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much ; and , therefore , she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too . "
58707	58904	58686	58686	she	128	" Oh ! yes -- Mr. Elton , I understand -- certainly as to dancing-- Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was-- Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of Jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , Jane is so very great a favourite there . Whenever she is with us , Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can . And so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , ` I know you can not have heard from Jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ; ' and when I immediately said , ` But indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning , ' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized . ` Have you , upon your honour ? ' said she ; ` well , that is quite unexpected . Do let me hear what she says . ' "
58919	58940	58905	58905	Emma	128	" Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately ? I am extremely happy . I hope she is well ? "
58941	58950	58952	58955	the happily deceived aunt	1218	" Thank you . You are so kind ! "
58962	59342	58905	58905	Emma	128	letter.--"Oh ! here it is . I was sure it could not be far off ; but I had put my huswife upon it , you see , without being aware , and so it was quite hid , but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table . I was reading it to Mrs. Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her-- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says;--but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see-- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half . My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well . She often says , when the letter is first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work'-- do n't you , ma'am?--And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her-- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word . And , indeed , though my mother 's eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank God ! with the help of spectacles . It is such a blessing ! My mother 's are really very good indeed . Jane often says , when she is here , ` I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish my eyes may last me as well . ' "
59371	59377	59379	59380	Miss Bates	109	" You are extremely kind , "
59385	59435	59379	59380	Miss Bates	109	" you who are such a judge , and write so beautifully yourself . I am sure there is nobody 's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse 's . My mother does not hear ; she is a little deaf you know . Ma'am , "
59439	59456	59379	59380	Miss Bates	109	" do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane 's handwriting ? "
59532	59679	59521	59522	Miss Bates	109	" My mother 's deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all . By only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice . But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me . Jane speaks so distinct ! However , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother 's time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here . We never were so long without seeing her before , and as I was telling Mrs. Cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now . "
59680	59689	60342	60342	she	1220	" Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon ? "
59690	59697	59521	59522	Miss Bates	109	" Oh yes ; next week . "
59698	59707	60342	60342	she	1220	" Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure . "
59708	59857	59521	59522	Miss Bates	109	" Thank you . You are very kind . Yes , next week . Every body is so surprized ; and every body says the same obliging things . I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury , as they can be to see her . Yes , Friday or Saturday ; she can not say which , because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days . So very good of them to send her the whole way ! But they always do , you know . Oh yes , Friday or Saturday next . That is what she writes about . That is the reason of her writing out of rule , as we call it ; for , in the common course , we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday . "
59858	59885	60342	60342	she	1220	" Yes , so I imagined . I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to - day . "
59886	60310	59521	59522	Miss Bates	109	" So obliging of you ! No , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon . My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months with us at least . Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you . The case is , you see , that the Campbells are going to Ireland . Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly . They had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last October , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , I was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , I declare I do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in Jane 's letter -- wrote in Mr. Dixon 's name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in Dublin , and take them back to their country seat , Baly - craig , a beautiful place , I fancy . Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from Mr. Dixon , I mean-- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter 's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon , for which I do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland ; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself . He is a most amiable , charming young man , I believe . Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland , from his account of things . "
60353	60402	60342	60342	she	1220	" You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time . Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs. Dixon , you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell . "
60403	60634	60342	60342	she	1220	" Very true , very true , indeed . The very thing that we have always been rather afraid of ; for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us , for months together -- not able to come if any thing was to happen . But you see , every thing turns out for the best . They want her ( Mr. and Mrs. Dixon ) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell ; quite depend upon it ; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _ joint _ invitation , Jane says , as you will hear presently ; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention . He is a most charming young man . Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit-- ( I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we had the history of that day , I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon ! "
60635	60667	60342	60342	she	1220	" But , in spite of all her friends ' urgency , and her own wish of seeing Ireland , Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates ? "
60668	60724	60342	60342	she	1220	" Yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and Colonel and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _ wish _ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately . "
60725	60777	60342	60342	she	1220	" I am concerned to hear of it . I think they judge wisely . But Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed . Mrs. Dixon , I understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with Miss Fairfax . "
60778	60816	60342	60342	she	1220	" Oh ! no . You are very obliging to say such things -- but certainly not . There is no comparison between them . Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain -- but extremely elegant and amiable . "
60817	60824	60342	60342	she	1220	" Yes , that of course . "
60825	60979	60342	60342	she	1220	" Jane caught a bad cold , poor thing ! so long ago as the 7th of November , ( as I am going to read to you , ) and has never been well since . A long time , is not it , for a cold to hang upon her ? She never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us . Just like her ! so considerate!--But however , she is so far from well , that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home , and try an air that always agrees with her ; and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her-- and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here , than go to Ireland , if she is unwell . Nobody could nurse her , as we should do . "
60980	60993	60342	60342	she	1220	" It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world . "
60994	61387	60342	60342	she	1220	" And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday , and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following-- as you will find from Jane 's letter . So sudden!--You may guess , dear Miss Woodhouse , what a flurry it has thrown me in ! If it was not for the drawback of her illness -- but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin , and looking very poorly . I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me , as to that . I always make a point of reading Jane 's letters through to myself first , before I read them aloud to my mother , you know , for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her . Jane desired me to do it , so I always do : and so I began to - day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell , than I burst out , quite frightened , with ` Bless me ! poor Jane is ill!'-- which my mother , being on the watch , heard distinctly , and was sadly alarmed at . However , when I read on , I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first ; and I make so light of it now to her , that she does not think much about it . But I can not imagine how I could be so off my guard . If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr. Perry . The expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know . He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time . Well , now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her . "
61388	61398	61400	61400	Emma	128	" I am afraid we must be running away , "
61409	61480	60342	60342	she	1220	rise--"My father will be expecting us . I had no intention , I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes , when I first entered the house . I merely called , because I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates ; but I have been so pleasantly detained ! Now , however , we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good morning . "
63023	63109	63112	63112	her	128	" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other . "
63787	63799	63800	63800	Jane	157	" She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome ! "
64197	64200	64226	64226	he	106	" Was he handsome?"--"She
64211	64212	64214	64214	he	106	" "
64215	64216	64217	64217	He	106	agreeable?"-- "
64223	64224	64217	64217	He	106	" "
64237	64292	64226	64226	he	106	information?"--"At a watering - place , or in a common London acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points . Manners were all that could be safely judged of , under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill . She believed every body found his manners pleasing . "
64409	64415	64416	64416	he	106	" A very pleasant evening , "
64441	64538	64416	64416	he	106	away;--"particularly pleasant . You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music . I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one 's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma . You left nothing undone . I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother 's , it must have been a real indulgence . "
64539	64546	64548	64548	Emma	128	" I am happy you approved , "
64552	64570	64548	64548	Emma	128	" but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield . "
64571	64577	64579	64580	her father	434	" No , my dear , "
64583	64636	64579	64580	her father	434	" _ that _ I am sure you are not . There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are . If any thing , you are too attentive . The muffin last night -- if it had been handed round once , I think it would have been enough . "
64637	64640	64642	64643	Mr. Knightley	97	" No , "
64651	64675	64642	64643	Mr. Knightley	97	" you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension . I think you understand me , therefore . "
64679	64685	64687	64687	she	128	expressed--"I understand you well enough ; "
64691	64697	64687	64687	she	128	" Miss Fairfax is reserved . "
64698	64742	64579	64580	her father	434	" I always told you she was -- a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence . What arises from discretion must be honoured . "
64743	64755	64687	64687	she	128	" You think her diffident . I do not see it . "
64756	64761	64763	64763	he	97	" My dear Emma , "
64775	64795	64763	64763	he	97	" you are not going to tell me , I hope , that you had not a pleasant evening . "
64796	64822	64687	64687	she	128	" Oh ! no ; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions ; and amused to think how little information I obtained . "
64823	64828	64830	64830	his	97	" I am disappointed , "
64834	64844	64850	64850	his	91	" I hope every body had a pleasant evening , "
64854	64975	64850	64850	his	91	" I had . Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me . Miss Bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick . However , she is very agreeable , and Mrs. Bates too , in a different way . I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed . She must have found the evening agreeable , Mr. Knightley , because she had Emma . "
64976	64990	64991	64991	Emma	128	" True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax . "
65019	65054	64991	64991	Emma	128	" She is a sort of elegant creature that one can not keep one 's eyes from . I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart . "
65090	65237	65078	65079	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined ! a great pity indeed ! and I have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon-- Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate -- Hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork -- I think we had better send the leg-- do not you think so , my dear ? "
65238	65289	65078	65079	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" My dear papa , I sent the whole hind - quarter . I knew you would wish it . There will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like . "
65290	65375	65078	65079	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" That 's right , my dear , very right . I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way . They must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , I do not consider it unwholesome . "
65376	65379	65381	65382	Mr. Knightley	97	" Emma , "
65385	65415	65381	65382	Mr. Knightley	97	" I have a piece of news for you . You like news -- and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you . "
65416	65441	65442	65442	He	97	" News ! Oh ! yes , I always like news . What is it?--why do you smile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls ? "
65449	65463	65442	65442	He	97	" No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls , "
65523	65575	65500	65501	Mr. Knightley	97	" Oh ! my dear sir , how are you this morning ? My dear Miss Woodhouse-- I come quite over - powered . Such a beautiful hind - quarter of pork ! You are too bountiful ! Have you heard the news ? Mr. Elton is going to be married . "
65612	65623	65625	65626	Mr. Knightley	97	" There is my news:--I thought it would interest you , "
65645	65655	65657	65658	Miss Bates	109	" But where could _ you _ hear it ? "
65660	65865	65657	65658	Miss Bates	109	" Where could you possibly hear it , Mr. Knightley ? For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole 's note -- no , it can not be more than five-- or at least ten -- for I had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out -- I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork -- Jane was standing in the passage -- were not you , Jane?-- for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough . So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ` Shall I go down instead ? for I think you have a little cold , and Patty has been washing the kitchen . '--`Oh ! my dear , ' said I -- well , and just then came the note . A Miss Hawkins-- that 's all I know . A Miss Hawkins of Bath . But , Mr. Knightley , how could you possibly have heard it ? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me . A Miss Hawkins-- "
65866	65901	65965	65966	Mr. Woodhouse--"indeed	201	" I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago . He had just read Elton 's letter as I was shewn in , and handed it to me directly . "
65902	65955	65657	65658	Miss Bates	109	" Well ! that is quite -- I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting . My dear sir , you really are too bountiful . My mother desires her very best compliments and regards , and a thousand thanks , and says you really quite oppress her . "
65956	65963	65965	65966	Mr. Woodhouse--"indeed	201	" We consider our Hartfield pork , "
65966	65990	65657	65658	Miss Bates	109	Woodhouse--"indeed it certainly is , so very superior to all other pork , that Emma and I can not have a greater pleasure than-- "
65991	66070	65965	65966	Mr. Woodhouse--"indeed	201	" Oh ! my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us . If ever there were people who , without having great wealth themselves , had every thing they could wish for , I am sure it is us . We may well say that ` our lot is cast in a goodly heritage . ' Well , Mr. Knightley , and so you actually saw the letter ; well-- "
66071	66088	65657	65658	Miss Bates	109	" It was short -- merely to announce -- but cheerful , exulting , of course . "--
66097	66150	65965	65966	Mr. Woodhouse--"indeed	201	" He had been so fortunate as to-- I forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them . The information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins . By his style , I should imagine it just settled . "
66151	66159	66161	66161	Emma	128	" Mr. Elton going to be married ! "
66170	66182	66161	66161	Emma	128	" He will have every body 's wishes for his happiness . "
66183	66191	66193	66194	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" He is very young to settle , "
66198	66229	66193	66194	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" He had better not be in a hurry . He seemed to me very well off as he was . We were always glad to see him at Hartfield . "
66230	66241	66243	66244	Miss Bates	109	" A new neighbour for us all , Miss Woodhouse ! "
66248	66295	66243	66244	Miss Bates	109	" my mother is so pleased!--she says she can not bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress . This is great news , indeed . Jane , you have never seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him . "
66312	66322	66323	66323	she	109	" No -- I have never seen Mr. Elton , "
66331	66341	66323	66323	she	109	" is he -- is he a tall man ? "
66342	66349	66351	66351	Emma	128	" Who shall answer that question ? "
66353	66413	66351	66351	Emma	128	" My father would say ` yes , ' Mr. Knightley ` no ; ' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium . When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind . "
66414	66634	66637	66638	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Very true , Miss Woodhouse , so she will . He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry . Miss Hawkins,--I dare say , an excellent young woman . His extreme attention to my mother-- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know -- it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick . Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf . He fancied bathing might be good for it -- the warm bath-- but she says it did him no lasting benefit . Colonel Campbell , you know , is quite our angel . And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him . It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do . Now , here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins ; and there are the Coles , such very good people ; and the Perrys -- I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry . I say , sir , "
66640	66687	66637	66638	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" I think there are few places with such society as Highbury . I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork-- a roast loin of pork-- "
66688	66709	66711	66711	Emma	128	" As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her , "
66713	66741	66711	66711	Emma	128	" nothing I suppose can be known . One feels that it can not be a very long acquaintance . He has been gone only four weeks . "
66760	66826	66757	66757	Emma	128	" You are silent , Miss Fairfax -- but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news . You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell 's account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins . "
66827	66835	66837	66837	Jane	157	" When I have seen Mr. Elton , "
66839	66879	66837	66837	Jane	157	" I dare say I shall be interested -- but I believe it requires _ that _ with me . And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off . "
66880	66898	66900	66901	Miss Bates	109	" Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse , "
66903	67083	66900	66901	Miss Bates	109	" four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs. Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man -- but'--In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries . I do not pretend to it . What is before me , I see . At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired -- Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly . She knows I would not offend for the world . How does Miss Smith do ? She seems quite recovered now . Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately ? Oh ! those dear little children . Jane , do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley . I mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative . "
67084	67099	66757	66757	Emma	128	" Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all . "
67100	67143	66900	66901	Miss Bates	109	" Very odd ! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand . One takes up a notion , and runs away with it . Mr. Dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ? "
67144	67165	66757	66757	Emma	128	" Handsome ! Oh ! no -- far from it -- certainly plain . I told you he was plain . "
67166	67187	66900	66901	Miss Bates	109	" My dear , you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself-- "
67188	67232	66757	66757	Emma	128	" Oh ! as for me , my judgment is worth nothing . Where I have a regard , I always think a person well - looking . But I gave what I believed the general opinion , when I called him plain . "
67233	67431	66757	66757	Emma	128	" Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away . The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy . You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave . This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed . I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole 's ; but I shall not stop three minutes : and , Jane , you had better go home directly -- I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already . Thank you , we do indeed . I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _ boiled _ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing . Good morning to you , my dear sir . Oh ! Mr. Knightley is coming too . Well , that is so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm.--Mr . Elton , and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning to you . "
67644	67657	67621	67621	Harriet	115	" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened ! "
67705	67843	67846	67854	the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper	1304	" She had set out from Mrs. Goddard 's half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to Hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford's . "--Ford
67871	68540	67846	67854	the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper	1304	place.--"And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in-- to be sure it was so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's-- who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!-- Dear Miss Woodhouse ! only think . I thought I should have fainted . I did not know what to do . I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella . I am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh ! dear ; I was so miserable ! I am sure I must have been as white as my gown . I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there.--Oh ! dear , Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another . I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would . She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _ try _ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble!--I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind ! Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable ! By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think!-- I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one ca n't tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole 's stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain . Oh ! dear , I thought it would have been the death of me ! So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables -- I believe I did -- but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly . And Elizabeth , too . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again . "
68752	68762	68764	68764	she	128	" It might be distressing , for the moment , "
68766	68804	68764	68764	she	128	" but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never-- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it . "
68808	68812	68814	68814	she	115	" very true , "
68815	68822	68825	68825	she	115	" would not think about it ; "
71779	71787	71778	71780	neither " master	3896	" master nor mistress was at home ; "
71805	71811	71813	71813	Emma	128	" This is too bad , "
71820	71841	71813	71813	Emma	128	" And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so disappointed . "
71932	72062	71925	71926	Mr. Weston	92	" How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father-- glad to see him so well . Frank comes to - morrow -- I had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty-- he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so . If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days ; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather . We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish . "
72237	72247	72249	72249	he	92	" I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield , "
72273	72283	72285	72285	she	128	" We had better move on , Mr. Weston , "
72287	72294	72285	72285	she	128	" we are detaining the girls . "
72295	72302	72344	72344	his	92	" Well , well , I am ready;"--and
72308	72342	72344	72344	his	92	" but you must not be expecting such a _ very _ fine young man ; you have only had _ my _ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:"--
72375	72391	72393	72394	Mrs. Weston	169	" Think of me to - morrow , my dear Emma , about four o'clock , "
72410	72422	72424	72425	Mr. Weston	92	" Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three , "
72509	72520	72488	72488	she	128	" Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?"--
72599	72605	72606	72606	she	128	" My dear , dear anxious friend,"--said
72620	72658	72606	72606	she	128	" always overcareful for every body 's comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right . "
72670	72724	72606	72606	she	128	" ' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here . I am sure they will bring him soon . "
72975	72981	72983	72984	Mr. Weston	92	" I told you yesterday , "
72988	73062	72983	72984	Mr. Weston	92	" I told you all that he would be here before the time named . I remembered what I used to do myself . One can not creep upon a journey ; one can not help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one 's friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs . "
73063	73076	73078	73080	the young man	542	" It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it , "
73082	73111	73078	73080	the young man	542	" though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far ; but in coming _ home _ I felt I might do any thing . "
73308	73343	73274	73274	He	542	inquiries,--"Was she a horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?-- Pleasant walks?--Had they a large neighbourhood?--Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough?--There were several very pretty houses in and about it.--Balls -- had they balls?--Was it a musical society ? "
73491	73497	73498	73498	he	542	" His father 's marriage , "
73501	73539	73498	73498	he	542	" had been the wisest measure , every friend must rejoice in it ; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him . "
73626	73637	73639	73639	he	542	" Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for , "
73641	73686	73639	73639	he	542	" but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston . "
73687	73702	73704	73704	Emma	128	" You can not see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings , "
73706	73757	73704	73704	Emma	128	" were you to guess her to be _ eighteen _ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _ she _ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words . Do n't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman . "
73758	73766	73767	73767	he	1408	" I hope I should know better , "
73770	73807	73767	73767	he	1408	" no , depend upon it , ( with a gallant bow , ) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms . "
74133	74169	74129	74130	Mr. Weston	92	move.--"He must be going . He had business at the Crown about his hay , and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford 's , but he need not hurry any body else . "
74187	74305	74129	74130	Mr. Weston	92	" As you are going farther on business , sir , I will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now . I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma , ) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax . I shall have no difficulty , I suppose , in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I believe , is not the proper name -- I should rather say Barnes , or Bates . Do you know any family of that name ? "
74306	74313	74315	74316	his father	526	" To be sure we do , "
74318	74368	74315	74316	his father	526	" Mrs. Bates -- we passed her house-- I saw Miss Bates at the window . True , true , you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax ; I remember you knew her at Weymouth , and a fine girl she is . Call upon her , by all means . "
74369	74380	74382	74384	the young man	542	" There is no necessity for my calling this morning , "
74386	74404	74382	74384	the young man	542	" another day would do as well ; but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which-- "
74405	74512	74315	74316	his father	526	" Oh ! go to - day , go to - day . Do not defer it . What is right to be done can not be done too soon . And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her _ here _ should be carefully avoided . You saw her with the Campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on . If you do not call early it will be a slight . "
74518	74528	74530	74530	Emma	128	" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance , "
74532	74541	74530	74530	Emma	128	" she is a very elegant young woman . "
74552	74555	74315	74316	his father	526	" Yes , "
74594	74606	74608	74608	she	128	" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before , "
74610	74656	74608	74608	she	128	" I think you will to - day . You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue . "
74657	74671	74673	74674	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ? "
74686	74758	74673	74674	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady . She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life . They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way . "
74759	74777	74608	74608	she	128	" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me . "
74778	74851	74673	74674	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . "
74877	74921	74867	74868	his father	526	" My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs. Bates 's , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump . "
75050	75094	75098	75099	Mrs. Weston	169	Highbury.--"He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same . Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction . "--
76109	76114	76091	76091	Emma	128	" Yes , oh ! yes"--he
76117	76278	76091	76091	Emma	128	" I was just going to mention it . A very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me . As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit . Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour . The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before . "
76279	76289	76359	76359	Emma	128	" And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ? "
76290	76358	76091	76091	Emma	128	" Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs. Weston , is it ? Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.-- A most deplorable want of complexion . "
76377	76419	76359	76359	Emma	128	" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face . "
76497	76500	76502	76502	Emma	128	" Well , "
76504	76519	76502	76502	Emma	128	" there is no disputing about taste.--At least you admire her except her complexion . "
76525	76535	76520	76520	He	1463	laughed.--"I can not separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion . "
76536	76553	76522	76522	his	1463	" Did you see her often at Weymouth ? Were you often in the same society ? "
76568	76672	76564	76564	he	1463	" Ha ! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives , as my father informs me . He comes to Highbury himself , he says , six days out of the seven , and has always business at Ford 's . If it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that I may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of Highbury . I must buy something at Ford 's . It will be taking out my freedom.-- I dare say they sell gloves . "
76673	76732	76522	76522	his	1463	" Oh ! yes , gloves and every thing . I do admire your patriotism . You will be adored in Highbury . You were very popular before you came , because you were Mr. Weston 's son -- but lay out half a guinea at Ford 's , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues . "
76747	76751	76520	76520	He	1463	" Men 's Beavers "
76753	76756	76520	76520	He	1463	" York Tan "
76767	76833	76522	76522	his	1463	said--"But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _ amor _ _ patriae _ . Do not let me lose it . I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life . "
76834	76853	76766	76766	he	1468	" I merely asked , whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth . "
76854	76912	76522	76522	his	1463	" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one . It is always the lady 's right to decide on the degree of acquaintance . Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.-- I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow . "
76913	76975	76766	76766	he	1468	" Upon my word ! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself . But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her . "
76976	77047	76522	76522	his	1463	" May I , indeed?--Then I will speak the truth , and nothing suits me so well . I met her frequently at Weymouth . I had known the Campbells a little in town ; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set . Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man , and Mrs. Campbell a friendly , warm - hearted woman . I like them all . "
77048	77068	76766	76766	he	1468	" You know Miss Fairfax 's situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ? "
77069	77076	76522	76522	his	1463	" Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do . "
77077	77086	77088	77089	Mrs. Weston	169	" You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , "
77092	77125	77088	77089	Mrs. Weston	169	" remember that I am here.--Mr . Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax 's situation in life . I will move a little farther off . "
77126	77138	77140	77140	Emma	128	" I certainly do forget to think of _ her _ , "
77142	77157	77140	77140	Emma	128	" as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend . "
77185	77200	77202	77203	Frank Churchill	106	" Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ? "
77205	77210	77212	77212	Emma	128	" Ever hear her ! "
77214	77242	77212	77212	Emma	128	" You forget how much she belongs to Highbury . I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began . She plays charmingly . "
77243	77404	77158	77158	He	1469	" You think so , do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge . She appeared to me to play well , that is , with considerable taste , but I know nothing of the matter myself.-- I am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body 's performance.--I have been used to hear her 's admired ; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:--a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- on the point of marriage-- would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead -- never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other . That , I thought , in a man of known musical talent , was some proof . "
77405	77409	77411	77411	Emma	128	" Proof indeed ! "
77414	77451	77411	77411	Emma	128	amused.--"Mr . Dixon is very musical , is he ? We shall know more about them all , in half an hour , from you , than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year . "
77452	77473	77158	77158	He	1469	" Yes , Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof . "
77474	77550	77411	77411	Emma	128	" Certainly -- very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _ I _ had been Miss Campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me . I could not excuse a man 's having more music than love -- more ear than eye -- a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings . How did Miss Campbell appear to like it ? "
77551	77562	77158	77158	He	1469	" It was her very particular friend , you know . "
77563	77567	77569	77569	Emma	128	" Poor comfort ! "
77573	77636	77569	77569	Emma	128	" One would rather have a stranger preferred than one 's very particular friend -- with a stranger it might not recur again -- but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself!-- Poor Mrs. Dixon ! Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland . "
77637	77661	77158	77158	He	1469	" You are right . It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell ; but she really did not seem to feel it . "
77662	77726	77569	77569	Emma	128	" So much the better -- or so much the worse:--I do not know which . But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling -- there was one person , I think , who must have felt it : Miss Fairfax herself . She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction . "
77727	77735	77158	77158	He	1469	" As to that -- I do not-- "
77736	77796	77569	77569	Emma	128	" Oh ! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax 's sensations from you , or from any body else . They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself . But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon , one may guess what one chuses . "
77797	77808	77809	77809	he	1472	" There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all-- "
77820	77894	77816	77816	himself	1472	" however , it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were-- how it might all be behind the scenes . I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly . But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be . "
77895	78011	77569	77569	Emma	128	" I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends . But we never did . I hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set . And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved . "
78012	78022	78024	78024	he	1473	" It is a most repulsive quality , indeed , "
78026	78056	78024	78024	he	1473	" Oftentimes very convenient , no doubt , but never pleasing . There is safety in reserve , but no attraction . One can not love a reserved person . "
78057	78174	78175	78175	He	1473	" Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater . But I must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than I have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body 's reserve to procure one . Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question . I have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal . "
78780	78790	78764	78764	her	169	" all young people would have their little whims . "
79093	79103	79089	79090	Mrs. Weston	169	" all young people would have their little whims . "
79224	79238	79207	79207	him	1507	" Hum ! just the trifling , silly fellow I took him for . "
79723	79743	79716	79717	Mrs. Weston	169	" I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out , "
79933	79941	79923	79923	her	115	" of course it must be declined , "
80012	80064	80069	80069	she	115	" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company . "
80180	80190	80358	80359	Mrs. Weston	169	" I am not fond of dinner - visiting , "
80192	80354	80358	80359	Mrs. Weston	169	he--"I never was . No more is Emma . Late hours do not agree with us . I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it . I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to . However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr. Knightley too , to take care of her , I can not wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy . "
80366	80386	80358	80359	Mrs. Weston	169	reproach--"Ah ! Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me . "
80387	80392	80394	80395	Mr. Weston	92	" Well , sir , "
80397	80435	80394	80395	Mr. Weston	92	" as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment , if you wish it . "
80498	80549	80487	80488	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard . He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her . James could take the note . But first of all , there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole . "
80550	80719	81204	81204	He	1535	" You will make my excuses , my dear , as civilly as possible . You will say that I am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _ compliments _ , of course . But you will do every thing right . I need not tell you what is to be done . We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday . I shall have no fears for you with him . We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely . And when you get there , you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again ; and you had better name an early hour . You will not like staying late . You will get very tired when tea is over . "
80720	80737	80487	80488	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ? "
80738	80771	81204	81204	He	1535	" Oh ! no , my love ; but you will soon be tired . There will be a great many people talking at once . You will not like the noise . "
80772	80779	80781	80782	Mr. Weston	92	" But , my dear sir , "
80784	80799	80781	80782	Mr. Weston	92	" if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party . "
80800	80809	80811	80812	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" And no great harm if it does , "
80814	80825	80811	80812	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" The sooner every party breaks up , the better . "
80826	80942	81204	81204	He	1535	" But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles . Emma 's going away directly after tea might be giving offence . They are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body 's hurrying away is no great compliment ; and Miss Woodhouse 's doing it would be more thought of than any other person 's in the room . You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ ten _ years . "
80943	81088	80811	80812	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" No , upon no account in the world , Mr. Weston ; I am much obliged to you for reminding me . I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain . I know what worthy people they are . Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor . You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- Mr. Cole is very bilious . No , I would not be the means of giving them any pain . My dear Emma , we must consider this . I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish . You will not regard being tired . You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends . "
81089	81203	81204	81204	He	1535	" Oh yes , papa . I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston , but on your account . I am only afraid of your sitting up for me . I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard . She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort . You must promise me not to sit up . "
81411	81543	81406	81406	Emma	128	" I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way . Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it . Mr. Knightley , he is _ not _ a trifling , silly young man . If he were , he would have done this differently . He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it . There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.--No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly . "
81904	81913	81915	81915	she	128	" This is coming as you should do , "
81917	81929	81915	81915	she	128	" like a gentleman.-- I am quite glad to see you . "
81936	81992	81930	81930	He	97	" How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.-- You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner . "
81993	82117	82124	82124	his	1550	" Yes I should , I am sure I should . There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them . You think you carry it off very well , I dare say , but with you it is a sort of bravado , an air of affected unconcern ; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances . _ Now _ you have nothing to try for . You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed . You are not striving to look taller than any body else . _ Now _ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you . "
82118	82122	82124	82124	his	1550	" Nonsensical girl ! "
82579	82586	82588	82589	Mrs. Cole	186	" One can suppose nothing else , "
82591	82661	82588	82589	Mrs. Cole	186	" and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt . But Jane , it seems , had a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it . She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present . They might chuse to surprize her . "
82723	82990	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" I declare , I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument . It seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away . This is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure ! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with.--I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought-- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening . "
83020	83026	83028	83028	she	186	" Why do you smile ? "
83030	83037	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" Nay , why do you ? "
83038	83060	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell 's being so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present . "
83061	83064	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" Very . "
83065	83076	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" I rather wonder that it was never made before . "
83077	83090	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before . "
83091	83119	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument-- which must now be shut up in London , untouched by any body . "
83120	83140	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs. Bates 's house . "
83141	83169	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" You may _ say _ what you chuse -- but your countenance testifies that your _ thoughts _ on this subject are very much like mine . "
83170	83232	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" I do not know . I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve . I smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; but at present I do not see what there is to question . If Colonel Campbell is not the person , who can be ? "
83233	83242	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" What do you say to Mrs. Dixon ? "
83243	83321	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" Mrs. Dixon ! very true indeed . I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon . She must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman 's scheme than an elderly man 's . It is Mrs. Dixon , I dare say . I told you that your suspicions would guide mine . "
83322	83341	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" If so , you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _ Mr _ . Dixon in them . "
83342	83386	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" Mr. Dixon.--Very well . Yes , I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon . We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance . "
83387	83629	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I can not help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _ her _ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side . One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland . Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment . As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body 's native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ? Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and I dare say in her 's . I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are . "
83630	83665	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" And , upon my word , they have an air of great probability . Mr. Dixon 's preference of her music to her friend 's , I can answer for being very decided . "
83666	83698	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" And then , he saved her life . Did you ever hear of that?-- A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard . He caught her . "
83699	83712	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" He did . I was there -- one of the party . "
83713	83747	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there , I think I should have made some discoveries . "
83748	83853	82991	82992	Miss Woodhouse	90	" I dare say you would ; but I , simple I , saw nothing but the fact , that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her.--It was the work of a moment . And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again-- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable . I do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries . "
83920	83965	83917	83917	Emma	128	" The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me . I wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough . Depend upon it , we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon . "
83966	83988	83917	83917	Emma	128	" And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells . "
83989	84059	83917	83917	Emma	128	" No , I am sure it is not from the Campbells . Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells , or they would have been guessed at first . She would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them . I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business . "
84060	84156	83917	83917	Emma	128	" Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced . Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely . At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world . But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . "
84557	84564	84565	84566	Mrs. Weston	169	" my excellent friend Colonel Campbell . "
84765	84782	84784	84784	she	128	" He had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naivete . "
84786	84814	84784	84784	she	128	" Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton . "
85290	85299	85301	85301	he	106	" I have made a most wretched discovery , "
85307	85358	85301	85301	he	106	" I have been here a week to - morrow -- half my time . I never knew days fly so fast . A week to - morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself . But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston , and others!-- I hate the recollection . "
85359	85385	85301	85301	he	106	" Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut . "
85386	85389	85391	85391	he	106	" No , "
85395	85424	85391	85391	he	106	" that is no subject of regret at all . I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen . "
85490	85496	85498	85498	she	128	" What is the matter ? "
85503	85510	85511	85511	he	106	" Thank you for rousing me , "
85514	85613	85511	85511	he	106	" I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that I can not keep my eyes from her . I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her own . I see nobody else looking like her!-- I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion . Shall I?-- Yes , I will -- I declare I will -- and you shall see how she takes it;-- whether she colours . "
85682	85692	85679	85680	Mrs. Weston	169	" This is the luxury of a large party , "
85694	85754	85679	85680	Mrs. Weston	169	she:--"one can get near every body , and say every thing . My dear Emma , I am longing to talk to you . I have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and I must tell them while the idea is fresh . Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here ? "
85755	85764	85679	85680	Mrs. Weston	169	" How?--They were invited , were not they ? "
85765	85781	85679	85680	Mrs. Weston	169	" Oh ! yes -- but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their coming ? "
85782	85795	85679	85680	Mrs. Weston	169	" They walked , I conclude . How else could they come ? "
85796	86110	85679	85680	Mrs. Weston	169	" Very true.--Well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now . And as I looked at her , though I never saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold . Poor girl ! I could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room , and I could get at him , I spoke to him about the carriage . You may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , I made my way directly to Miss Bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once . Good soul ! she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure . ` Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many , many thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us , for Mr. Knightley 's carriage had brought , and was to take them home again . ' I was quite surprized;--very glad , I am sure ; but really quite surprized . Such a very kind attention -- and so thoughtful an attention!-- the sort of thing that so few men would think of . And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all . I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them . "
86111	86115	85679	85680	Mrs. Weston	169	" Very likely , "
86117	86240	85679	85680	Mrs. Weston	169	Emma--"nothing more likely . I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent . He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax 's ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley . I know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray . "
86241	86244	86246	86247	Mrs. Weston	169	" Well , "
86251	86336	86246	86247	Mrs. Weston	169	" you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again . The more I think of it , the more probable it appears . In short , I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax . See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to it ? "
86337	86344	86346	86346	Emma	128	" Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax ! "
86348	86423	86346	86346	Emma	128	" Dear Mrs. Weston , how could you think of such a thing?--Mr . Knightley!--Mr . Knightley must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?-- Oh ! no , no , Henry must have Donwell . I can not at all consent to Mr. Knightley 's marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely . I am amazed that you should think of such a thing . "
86424	86501	85679	85680	Mrs. Weston	169	" My dear Emma , I have told you what led me to think of it . I do not want the match -- I do not want to injure dear little Henry-- but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry 's account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ? "
86502	86546	86346	86346	Emma	128	" Yes , I would . I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.-- Mr. Knightley marry!--No , I have never had such an idea , and I can not adopt it now . And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women ! "
86547	86566	85679	85680	Mrs. Weston	169	" Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know . "
86567	86576	86346	86346	Emma	128	" But the imprudence of such a match ! "
86577	86590	85679	85680	Mrs. Weston	169	" I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability . "
86591	86706	86346	86346	Emma	128	" I see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention . His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses . He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax-- and is always glad to shew them attention . My dear Mrs. Weston , do not take to match - making . You do it very ill . Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh ! no , no;--every feeling revolts . For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing . "
86707	86737	85679	85680	Mrs. Weston	169	" Imprudent , if you please -- but not mad . Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable . "
86738	86828	86346	86346	Emma	128	" But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry . I am sure he has not the least idea of it . Do not put it into his head . Why should he marry?-- He is as happy as possible by himself ; with his farm , and his sheep , and his library , and all the parish to manage ; and he is extremely fond of his brother 's children . He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart . "
86829	86852	85679	85680	Mrs. Weston	169	" My dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax-- "
86853	86890	86346	86346	Emma	128	" Nonsense ! He does not care about Jane Fairfax . In the way of love , I am sure he does not . He would do any good to her , or her family ; but-- "
86891	86894	86896	86897	Mrs. Weston	169	" Well , "
86901	86921	86896	86897	Mrs. Weston	169	" perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give Jane such a respectable home . "
86922	87050	86346	86346	Emma	128	" If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion . How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey , and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?-- ` So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour ! ' And then fly off , through half a sentence , to her mother 's old petticoat . ` Not that it was such a very old petticoat either -- for still it would last a great while -- and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong . ' "
87051	87301	86896	86897	Mrs. Weston	169	" For shame , Emma ! Do not mimic her . You divert me against my conscience . And , upon my word , I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates . Little things do not irritate him . She might talk on ; and if he wanted to say any thing himself , he would only talk louder , and drown her voice . But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does . I have heard him speak , and so must you , so very highly of Jane Fairfax ! The interest he takes in her-- his anxiety about her health -- his concern that she should have no happier prospect ! I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice ! I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever . Oh ! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody-- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr. Knightley ? I can not help suspecting him . I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love . "
87302	87340	86346	86346	Emma	128	" Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love . But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do . Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously . "
87341	87374	86896	86897	Mrs. Weston	169	" I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him . "
87375	87396	86346	86346	Emma	128	" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so . "
87397	87438	86896	86897	Mrs. Weston	169	" There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma . I have a very strong notion that it comes from him . I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner . "
87439	87496	86346	86346	Emma	128	" You take up an idea , Mrs. Weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . I see no sign of attachment-- I believe nothing of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax . "
88104	88110	88112	88112	she	128	" I often feel concern , "
88114	88159	88112	88112	she	128	" that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions . It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose . "
88160	88173	88174	88174	he	97	" Quite out of the question , quite out of the question , "
88176	88188	88174	88174	he	97	" but you must often wish it , I am sure . "
88207	88214	88112	88112	she	128	" This present from the Campbells , "
88216	88223	88112	88112	she	128	she--"this pianoforte is very kindly given . "
88224	88227	88228	88228	he	97	" Yes , "
88237	88280	88228	88228	he	97	" But they would have done better had they given her notice of it . Surprizes are foolish things . The pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable . I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell . "
88340	88345	88347	88347	he	97	" That will do , "
88356	88370	88347	88347	he	97	" you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet . "
88381	88401	88403	88404	Frank Churchill	106	" One more;--they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account , and would only ask for one more . "
88410	88438	88403	88404	Frank Churchill	106	" I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling . The strength of the song falls on the second . "
88444	88448	88450	88450	he	97	" That fellow , "
88454	88470	88450	88450	he	97	" thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice . This must not be . "
88481	88511	88473	88474	Miss Bates	109	near--"Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ? Go , and interfere . They have no mercy on her . "
88887	88894	88900	88900	he	106	" Perhaps it is as well , "
88907	88930	88900	88900	he	106	" I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your 's . "
89201	89217	89179	89179	Harriet	115	" Oh ! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax ! "
89218	89243	89543	89543	they	1641	" Do n't class us together , Harriet . My playing is no more like her 's , than a lamp is like sunshine . "
89244	89290	89179	89179	Harriet	115	" Oh ! dear -- I think you play the best of the two . I think you play quite as well as she does . I am sure I had much rather hear you . Every body last night said how well you played . "
89291	89332	89543	89543	they	1641	" Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference . The truth is , Harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but Jane Fairfax 's is much beyond it . "
89333	89395	89179	89179	Harriet	115	" Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out . Mr. Cole said how much taste you had ; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution . "
89396	89408	89543	89543	they	1641	" Ah ! but Jane Fairfax has them both , Harriet . "
89409	89503	89179	89179	Harriet	115	" Are you sure ? I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste . Nobody talked about it . And I hate Italian singing.-- There is no understanding a word of it . Besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach . The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family . How did you think the Coxes looked ? "
89504	89514	89543	89543	they	1641	" Just as they always do -- very vulgar . "
89515	89521	89523	89523	Harriet	115	" They told me something , "
89527	89536	89523	89523	Harriet	115	" but it is nothing of any consequence . "
89556	89570	89543	89543	they	1641	" They told me -- that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday . "
89571	89574	89543	89543	they	1641	" Oh ! "
89575	89594	89543	89543	they	1641	" He came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner . "
89595	89598	89543	89543	they	1641	" Oh ! "
89599	89637	89543	89543	they	1641	" They talked a great deal about him , especially Anne Cox . I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer . "
89638	89655	89543	89543	they	1641	" She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be . "
89656	89691	89543	89543	they	1641	" She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there . He sat by her at dinner . Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him . "
89692	89709	89543	89543	they	1641	" Very likely.--I think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury . "
90064	90071	90073	90073	she	169	" For my companion tells me , "
90075	90123	90073	90073	she	169	" that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning . I was not aware of it myself . I did not know that I had fixed a day , but as he says I did , I am going now . "
90124	90141	90143	90144	Frank Churchill	106	" And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope , "
90146	90163	90143	90144	Frank Churchill	106	" to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield-- if you are going home . "
90169	90186	90073	90073	she	169	" I thought you meant to go with me . They would be very much pleased . "
90187	90260	90073	90073	she	169	" Me ! I should be quite in the way . But , perhaps -- I may be equally in the way here . Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me . My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping . She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same . What am I to do ? "
90261	90272	90274	90274	Emma	128	" I am here on no business of my own , "
90276	90312	90274	90274	Emma	128	" I am only waiting for my friend . She will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home . But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument . "
90313	90392	90073	90073	she	169	" Well -- if you advise it.--But ( with a smile ) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall I say ? I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston . She might do very well by herself . A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood . "
90393	90402	90274	90274	Emma	128	" I do not believe any such thing , "
90404	90448	90073	90073	she	169	Emma.--"I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent . Quite otherwise indeed , if I understood Miss Fairfax 's opinion last night . "
90449	90455	90457	90458	Mrs. Weston	169	" Do come with me , "
90460	90517	90457	90458	Mrs. Weston	169	" if it be not very disagreeable to you . It need not detain us long . We will go to Hartfield afterwards . We will follow them to Hartfield . I really wish you to call with me . It will be felt so great an attention ! and I always thought you meant it . "
90621	90633	90635	90636	Mrs. Ford.--	234	" Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard 's , ma'am ? "
90637	90725	90635	90636	Mrs. Ford.--	234	" Yes -- no -- yes , to Mrs. Goddard 's . Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield . No , you shall send it to Hartfield , if you please . But then , Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gown home any day . But I shall want the ribbon directly-- so it had better go to Hartfield -- at least the ribbon . You could make it into two parcels , Mrs. Ford , could not you ? "
90726	90745	90635	90636	Mrs. Ford.--	234	" It is not worth while , Harriet , to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two parcels . "
90746	90752	90635	90636	Mrs. Ford.--	234	" No more it is . "
90753	90762	90764	90767	the obliging Mrs. Ford	217	" No trouble in the world , ma'am , "
90769	90836	90635	90636	Mrs. Ford.--	234	" Oh ! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one . Then , if you please , you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's-- I do not know -- No , I think , Miss Woodhouse , I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield , and take it home with me at night . What do you advise ? "
90837	90861	90895	90895	Voices	236	" That you do not give another half - second to the subject . To Hartfield , if you please , Mrs. Ford . "
90862	90871	90873	90873	Harriet	115	" Aye , that will be much best , "
90878	90894	90873	90873	Harriet	115	" I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard 's . "
90919	90925	90927	90928	the latter	1662	" My dear Miss Woodhouse , "
90930	90996	90927	90928	the latter	1662	" I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while , and give us your opinion of our new instrument ; you and Miss Smith . How do you do , Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me , that I might be sure of succeeding . "
90997	91006	90895	90895	Voices	236	" I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are-- "
91007	91604	90927	90928	the latter	1662	" Very well , I am much obliged to you . My mother is delightfully well ; and Jane caught no cold last night . How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad to hear such a good account . Mrs. Weston told me you were here.-- Oh ! then , said I , I must run across , I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party , she can not refuse.--`Aye , pray do , ' said Mr. Frank Churchill , ` Miss Woodhouse 's opinion of the instrument will be worth having . '-- But , said I , I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--`Oh , ' said he , ` wait half a minute , till I have finished my job;'--For , would you believe it , Miss Woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother 's spectacles.--The rivet came out , you know , this morning.-- So very obliging!--For my mother had no use of her spectacles-- could not put them on . And , by the bye , every body ought to have two pair of spectacles ; they should indeed . Jane said so . I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know . At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping . Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me . Here is the rivet of your mistress 's spectacles out . Then the baked apples came home , Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always -- I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them . And it can not be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ? Only three of us.-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it . I dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off . But about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry ; I happened to meet him in the street . Not that I had any doubt before-- I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple . I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome . We have apple - dumplings , however , very often . Patty makes an excellent apple - dumpling . Well , Mrs. Weston , you have prevailed , I hope , and these ladies will oblige us . "
91608	91620	91605	91605	Emma	128	" very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates , & c. , "
91641	91706	90895	90895	Voices	236	" How do you do , Mrs. Ford ? I beg your pardon . I did not see you before . I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town . Jane came back delighted yesterday . Thank ye , the gloves do very well -- only a little too large about the wrist ; but Jane is taking them in . "
91707	91714	91716	91716	she	109	" What was I talking of ? "
91742	92677	91728	91728	Emma	128	" I declare I can not recollect what I was talking of.--Oh ! my mother 's spectacles . So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill ! ` Oh ! ' said he , ` I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively . '--Which you know shewed him to be so very . . . . Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing . . . . I do congratulate you , Mrs. Weston , most warmly . He seems every thing the fondest parent could . . . . ` Oh ! ' said he , ` I can fasten the rivet . I like a job of that sort excessively . ' I never shall forget his manner . And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ` Oh ! ' said he directly , ` there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good , and these are the finest - looking home - baked apples I ever saw in my life . ' That , you know , was so very . . . . And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment . Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times-- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it . The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from Donwell -- some of Mr. Knightley 's most liberal supply . He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- I believe there is two of them . My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days . But I was really quite shocked the other day-- for Mr. Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock . ` I am sure you must be , ' said he , ` and I will send you another supply ; for I have a great many more than I can ever use . William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year . I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing . ' So I begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same . And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me -- No , I should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could . However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose . William Larkins is such an old acquaintance ! I am always glad to see him . But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _ that _ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil . William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master 's profit than any thing ; but Mrs. Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away . She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple - tart this spring . He told Patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for Mrs. Hodges _ would _ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed ! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world ! He would be so very . . . . I wanted to keep it from Jane 's knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware . "
92715	92785	92786	92787	CHAPTER X	128	" Pray take care , Mrs. Weston , there is a step at the turning . Pray take care , Miss Woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase-- rather darker and narrower than one could wish . Miss Smith , pray take care . Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot . Miss Smith , the step at the turning . "
92877	92883	92885	92885	he	1670	" This is a pleasure , "
92893	92922	92885	92885	he	1670	" coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated . You find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think I shall succeed . "
92923	92926	92928	92929	Mrs. Weston	169	" What ! "
92931	92955	92928	92929	Mrs. Weston	169	" have not you finished it yet ? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate . "
92956	92964	92965	92965	he	1670	" I have not been working uninterruptedly , "
92968	93032	92965	92965	he	1670	" I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe . You see we have been wedging one leg with paper . This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come . I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home . "
93220	93227	93229	93230	Frank Churchill	106	" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ , "
93238	93316	93229	93230	Frank Churchill	106	" the person has not chosen ill . I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell 's taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _ all _ _ that _ _ party _ would particularly prize . I dare say , Miss Fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to Broadwood himself . Do not you think so ? "
93342	93348	93350	93350	Emma	128	" It is not fair , "
93356	93368	93350	93350	Emma	128	" mine was a random guess . Do not distress her . "
93397	93499	93393	93393	he	1675	" How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , Miss Fairfax . I dare say they often think of you , and wonder which will be the day , the precise day of the instrument 's coming to hand . Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ? "
93515	93525	93527	93527	she	1676	" Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell , "
93536	93551	93527	93527	she	1676	" I can imagine nothing with any confidence . It must be all conjecture . "
93552	93659	93503	93503	She	1676	" Conjecture -- aye , sometimes one conjectures right , and sometimes one conjectures wrong . I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm . What nonsense one talks , Miss Woodhouse , when hard at work , if one talks at all;--your real workmen , I suppose , hold their tongues ; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word -- Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing . There , it is done . I have the pleasure , madam , ( to Mrs. Bates , ) of restoring your spectacles , healed for the present . "
93702	93709	93711	93711	he	1677	" If you are very kind , "
93713	93778	93711	93711	he	1677	" it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night;--let me live them over again . You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time . I believe you were glad we danced no longer ; but I would have given worlds-- all the worlds one ever has to give -- for another half - hour . "
93782	93809	93827	93827	He	1677	" What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _ has _ made one happy!-- If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth . "
93845	93941	93827	93827	He	1677	" Here is something quite new to me . Do you know it?--Cramer.-- And here are a new set of Irish melodies . That , from such a quarter , one might expect . This was all sent with the instrument . Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell , was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here . I honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart . Nothing hastily done ; nothing incomplete . True affection only could have prompted it . "
94046	94057	94039	94039	Emma	128	" You speak too plain . She must understand you . "
94058	94082	94025	94025	He	1677	" I hope she does . I would have her understand me . I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning . "
94083	94102	94039	94039	Emma	128	" But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea . "
94103	94148	94025	94025	He	1677	" I am very glad you did , and that you communicated it to me . I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways . Leave shame to her . If she does wrong , she ought to feel it . "
94149	94160	94039	94039	Emma	128	" She is not entirely without it , I think . "
94161	94186	94025	94025	He	1677	" I do not see much sign of it . She is playing _ Robin _ _ Adair _ at this moment--_his _ favourite . "
94208	94279	94280	94280	She	109	" Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible , just to thank him . I will not open the window here ; it would give you all cold ; but I can go into my mother 's room you know . I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here . Quite delightful to have you all meet so!--Our little room so honoured ! "
94328	94380	94404	94404	he	97	" How d ' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well , I thank you . So obliged to you for the carriage last night . We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us . Pray come in ; do come in . You will find some friends here . "
94407	94453	94404	94404	he	97	" How is your niece , Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece . How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no cold last night . How is she to - day ? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is . "
94500	94514	94516	94517	Miss Bates	109	" So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage , "
94525	94540	94519	94519	He	97	" I am going to Kingston . Can I do any thing for you ? "
94541	94563	94519	94519	He	97	" Oh ! dear , Kingston -- are you?--Mrs . Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston . "
94564	94582	94519	94519	He	97	" Mrs. Cole has servants to send . Can I do any thing for _ you _ ? "
94583	94631	94519	94519	He	97	" No , I thank you . But do come in . Who do you think is here?-- Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith ; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte . Do put up your horse at the Crown , and come in . "
94632	94635	94637	94637	he	97	" Well , "
94644	94651	94637	94637	he	97	" for five minutes , perhaps . "
94652	94669	94519	94519	He	97	" And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful ; so many friends ! "
94670	94699	94637	94637	he	97	" No , not now , I thank you . I could not stay two minutes . I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can . "
94700	94717	94519	94519	He	97	" Oh ! do come in . They will be so very happy to see you . "
94718	94740	94637	94637	he	97	" No , no ; your room is full enough . I will call another day , and hear the pianoforte . "
94741	94786	94519	94519	He	97	" Well , I am so sorry!--Oh ! Mr. Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?-- Was not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it . "
94787	94894	94637	94637	he	97	" Oh ! very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes . And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too . I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England . Now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but I can not stay to hear it . "
94895	94920	94519	94519	He	97	" Oh ! Mr. Knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence-- so shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples ! "
94921	94928	94637	94637	he	97	" What is the matter now ? "
94929	95068	94519	94519	He	97	" To think of your sending us all your store apples . You said you had a great many , and now you have not one left . We really are so shocked ! Mrs. Hodges may well be angry . William Larkins mentioned it here . You should not have done it , indeed you should not . Ah ! he is off . He never can bear to be thanked . But I thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned . . . . Well , ( returning to the room , ) I have not been able to succeed . Mr. Knightley can not stop . He is going to Kingston . He asked me if he could do any thing . . . . "
95069	95072	95074	95074	Jane	157	" Yes , "
95076	95088	95074	95074	Jane	157	" we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing . "
95089	95177	94519	94519	He	97	" Oh ! yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr. Knightley spoke loud . You must have heard every thing to be sure . ` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ? ' said he ; so I just mentioned . . . . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , must you be going?--You seem but just come -- so very obliging of you . "
95615	95636	95816	95817	Somebody else	1631	" You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five , "
95644	95707	95816	95817	Somebody else	1631	" And there will be the two Gilberts , young Cox , my father , and myself , besides Mr. Knightley . Yes , that will be quite enough for pleasure . You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room . "
95718	95735	95794	95794	Somebody	619	" But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think there will . "
95739	95793	95794	95794	Somebody	619	" And after all , five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up . Five couple are nothing , when one thinks seriously about it . It will not do to _ invite _ five couple . It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment . "
95918	95932	95955	95955	Emma	128	" Might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ? "
96001	96006	96008	96008	he	91	" Oh ! no , "
96010	96150	96008	96008	he	91	" it would be the extreme of imprudence . I could not bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong . She would catch a dreadful cold . So would poor little Harriet . So you would all . Mrs. Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing . Pray do not let them talk of it . That young man ( speaking lower ) is very thoughtless . Do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing . He has been opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping them open very inconsiderately . He does not think of the draught . I do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing ! "
96251	96257	96259	96259	he	106	" We were too magnificent , "
96261	96275	96259	96259	he	106	" We allowed unnecessary room . Ten couple may stand here very well . "
96279	96303	96276	96276	Emma	128	" It would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ? "
96304	96308	96309	96309	he	106	" Very true , "
96313	96319	96309	96309	he	106	" it was very bad . "
96333	96346	96329	96329	he	106	" I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple . "
96347	96352	96354	96354	she	128	" No , no , "
96356	96394	96354	96354	she	128	" you are quite unreasonable . It would be dreadful to be standing so close ! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd -- and a crowd in a little room ! "
96395	96402	96403	96403	he	106	" There is no denying it , "
96406	96488	96403	96403	he	106	" I agree with you exactly . A crowd in a little room -- Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words . Exquisite , quite exquisite!--Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up . It would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- I do not know that -- I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well . "
96625	96631	96632	96632	he	106	" Well , Miss Woodhouse , "
96637	96720	96632	96632	he	106	" your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope , by the terrors of my father 's little rooms . I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a thought of my father 's , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon . May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ? "
96721	96725	96927	96927	She	1716	" The Crown ! "
96726	96863	96632	96632	he	106	" Yes ; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls . It is his own idea . Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied . This is what we all feel . Oh ! you were perfectly right ! Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _ any _ _ thing _ to like to yield . Is not it a good exchange?--You consent-- I hope you consent ? "
96864	96926	96927	96927	She	1716	" It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr. and Mrs. Weston do not . I think it admirable ; and , as far as I can answer for myself , shall be most happy -- It seems the only improvement that could be . Papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ? "
96958	97056	96632	96632	he	106	" No ; he thought it very far from an improvement -- a very bad plan-- much worse than the other . A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited . If they must dance , they had better dance at Randalls . He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh ! no -- a very bad plan . They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere . "
97057	97066	97068	97069	Frank Churchill	106	" I was going to observe , sir , "
97071	97119	97068	97069	Frank Churchill	106	" that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body 's catching cold-- so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls ! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could . "
97120	97123	97125	97126	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Sir , "
97131	97183	97125	97126	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character . Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill . But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father 's house . "
97184	97246	96632	96632	he	106	" From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir . We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief . "
97247	97304	97125	97126	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Open the windows!--but surely , Mr. Churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls . Nobody could be so imprudent ! I never heard of such a thing . Dancing with open windows!--I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs. Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it . "
97305	97343	96632	96632	he	106	" Ah ! sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected . I have often known it done myself . "
97344	97447	97125	97126	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Have you indeed , sir?--Bless me ! I never could have supposed it . But I live out of the world , and am often astonished at what I hear . However , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration . One can not resolve upon them in a hurry . If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done . "
97448	97460	96632	96632	he	106	" But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited-- "
97461	97464	97466	97466	Emma	128	" Oh ! "
97468	97519	97466	97466	Emma	128	" there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over . There is no hurry at all . If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses . They will be so near their own stable . "
97520	97586	96632	96632	he	106	" So they will , my dear . That is a great thing . Not that James ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can . If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired -- but is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted ? I doubt it . I do not know her , even by sight . "
97587	97618	97466	97466	Emma	128	" I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs. Weston 's care . Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole . "
97619	97700	96632	96632	he	106	" There , papa!--Now you must be satisfied -- Our own dear Mrs. Weston , who is carefulness itself . Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ? ` If _ Miss _ _ Taylor _ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir . ' How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ! "
97701	97804	97466	97466	Emma	128	" Aye , very true . Mr. Perry did say so . I shall never forget it . Poor little Emma ! You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry 's great attention . He came four times a day for a week . He said , from the first , it was a very good sort -- which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint . I hope whenever poor Isabella 's little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry . "
97805	97819	97821	97822	Frank Churchill	106	" My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment , "
97824	97900	97821	97822	Frank Churchill	106	" examining the capabilities of the house . I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . I was desired to say so from both . It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . They can do nothing satisfactorily without you . "
97982	97985	97987	97987	she	128	" Emma , "
97989	98025	97987	97987	she	128	" this paper is worse than I expected . Look ! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined . "
98026	98035	98037	98038	her husband	450	" My dear , you are too particular , "
98040	98079	98037	98038	her husband	450	" What does all that signify ? You will see nothing of it by candlelight . It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight . We never see any thing of it on our club - nights . "
98089	98100	98102	98103	the gentlemen	1445	" Men never know when things are dirty or not ; "
98110	98121	98102	98103	the gentlemen	1445	" Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares . "
98371	98393	98354	98354	She	169	" I do not think it _ is _ so very small . We shall not be many , you know . "
98415	98448	98354	98354	She	169	" You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear . It is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs . "
98449	98453	98455	98456	Mrs. Weston	169	" I wish , "
98458	98495	98455	98456	Mrs. Weston	169	" one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best . To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object -- if one could but tell what that would be . "
98496	98502	98504	98504	Frank	106	" Yes , very true , "
98506	98606	98504	98504	Frank	106	" very true . You want your neighbours ' opinions . I do not wonder at you . If one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the Coles , for instance . They are not far off . Shall I call upon them ? Or Miss Bates ? She is still nearer.-- And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body . I think we do want a larger council . Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us ? "
98607	98614	98616	98617	Mrs. Weston	169	" Well -- if you please , "
98621	98632	98616	98617	Mrs. Weston	169	" if you think she will be of any use . "
98633	98645	98647	98647	Emma	128	" You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates , "
98649	98683	98647	98647	Emma	128	" She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing . She will not even listen to your questions . I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates . "
98684	98717	98616	98617	Mrs. Weston	169	" But she is so amusing , so extremely amusing ! I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk . And I need not bring the whole family , you know . "
98737	98816	98616	98617	Mrs. Weston	169	" Aye , do , Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us end the matter at once . She will enjoy the scheme , I am sure ; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties . Fetch Miss Bates . We are growing a little too nice . She is a standing lesson of how to be happy . But fetch them both . Invite them both . "
98817	98826	98733	98733	his	92	" Both sir ! Can the old lady ? "
98830	98864	98616	98617	Mrs. Weston	169	" The old lady ! No , the young lady , to be sure . I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece . "
98865	98895	98616	98617	Mrs. Weston	169	" Oh ! I beg your pardon , sir . I did not immediately recollect . Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both . "
99185	99203	99178	99179	Mr. Weston	92	" He has asked her , my dear . That 's right . I knew he would ! "
99468	99603	99458	99458	Emma	128	" Very well . If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.-- Oh ! yes , I must be there ; I could not refuse ; and I will keep as much awake as I can ; but I would rather be at home , looking over William Larkins 's week 's account ; much rather , I confess.-- Pleasure in seeing dancing!--not I , indeed -- I never look at it-- I do not know who does.--Fine dancing , I believe , like virtue , must be its own reward . Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different . "
99676	99716	99673	99673	she	128	" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball . What a disappointment it would be ! I do look forward to it , I own , with _ very _ great pleasure . "
99965	100011	99961	99962	Mrs. Weston	169	" that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon . "
100085	100092	100082	100083	her partner	1769	happiest!--"I said it would be so , "
100228	100241	100220	100220	himself	1773	" Of all horrid things , leave - taking is the worst . "
100242	100249	100251	100251	Emma	128	" But you will come again , "
100253	100264	100251	100251	Emma	128	" This will not be your only visit to Randalls . "
100265	100328	100220	100220	himself	1773	" Ah!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able to return!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring -- but I am afraid -- they did not stir last spring-- I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever . "
100329	100339	100251	100251	Emma	128	" Our poor ball must be quite given up . "
100340	100383	100220	100220	himself	1773	" Ah ! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the pleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation , foolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , why are you always so right ? "
100384	100408	100251	100251	Emma	128	" Indeed , I am very sorry to be right in this instance . I would much rather have been merry than wise . "
100409	100436	100220	100220	himself	1773	" If I can come again , we are still to have our ball . My father depends on it . Do not forget your engagement . "
100441	100450	100451	100451	he	1774	" Such a fortnight as it has been ! "
100454	100486	100451	100451	he	1774	" every day more precious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making me less fit to bear any other place . Happy those , who can remain at Highbury ! "
100487	100497	100499	100499	Emma	128	" As you do us such ample justice now , "
100503	100567	100499	100499	Emma	128	" I will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ? Do not we rather surpass your expectations ? I am sure we do . I am sure you did not much expect to like us . You would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury . "
100588	100598	100451	100451	he	1774	" And you must be off this very morning ? "
100599	100634	100451	100451	he	1774	" Yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and I must be off immediately . I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him . "
100635	100666	100451	100451	he	1774	" Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates ? How unlucky ! Miss Bates 's powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours . "
100667	100761	100451	100451	he	1774	" Yes -- I _ have _ called there ; passing the door , I thought it better . It was a right thing to do . I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates 's being absent . She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in . She is a woman that one may , that one _ must _ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight . It was better to pay my visit , then"--
100773	100777	100779	100779	he	1775	" In short , "
100781	100795	100779	100779	he	1775	" perhaps , Miss Woodhouse -- I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion"--
100851	100868	100847	100847	she	1776	" You are quite in the right ; it was most natural to pay your visit , then"--
100947	100972	100934	100934	he	1775	" It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield . My regard for Hartfield is most warm"--
101075	101082	101084	101086	the young man	542	" It was time to go ; "
101104	101112	101114	101114	he	1775	" I shall hear about you all , "
101116	101190	101114	101114	he	1775	" that is my chief consolation . I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you . I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me . She has been so kind as to promise it . Oh ! the blessing of a female correspondent , when one is really interested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing . In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again . "
101202	101207	101222	101222	Short	254	" Good - bye , "
101450	101455	101457	101457	she	128	" I certainly must , "
101459	101568	101457	101457	she	128	" This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing 's being dull and insipid about the house!-- I must be in love ; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not -- for a few weeks at least . Well ! evil to some is always good to others . I shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball , if not for Frank Churchill ; but Mr. Knightley will be happy . He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes . "
101629	101657	101605	101605	he	97	" You , Emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck ! "
102064	102080	102082	102082	she.--	1783	" I do not find myself making any use of the word _ sacrifice _ , "
102083	102152	102082	102082	she.--	1783	" In not one of all my clever replies , my delicate negatives , is there any allusion to making a sacrifice . I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness . So much the better . I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do . I am quite enough in love . I should be sorry to be more . "
102168	102413	102157	102157	she	1783	" _ He _ is undoubtedly very much in love -- every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed!--and when he comes again , if his affection continue , I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up . Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto . No , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched . Could he have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at parting would have been different.-- Still , however , I must be on my guard . This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but I do not know that I expect it will ; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man-- I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.-- His feelings are warm , but I can imagine them rather changeable.-- Every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well again after a little while -- and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and I shall have been let off easily . "
102681	102711	102722	102722	herself	128	words--"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday , as you know , for Miss Woodhouse 's beautiful little friend . Pray make my excuses and adieus to her . "
102878	102883	102877	102881	the " beautiful little friend	4400	" beautiful little friend , "
102952	102960	102942	102942	Harriet	115	" I must not dwell upon it , "
102962	103023	102942	102942	Harriet	115	she.--"I must not think of it . I know the danger of indulging such speculations . But stranger things have happened ; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now , it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure . "
103139	103145	103148	103149	every body	2757	" Mr. Elton and his bride "
103339	103371	103333	103333	Harriet	115	" it was very true-- it was just as Miss Woodhouse described -- it was not worth while to think about them -- and she would not think about them any longer "
103407	103500	103400	103400	Emma	128	" Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton 's marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _ me _ . You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into . It was all my doing , I know . I have not forgotten it , I assure you.--Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you-- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever . Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it . "
103520	103693	103517	103517	Emma	128	" I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity . These are the motives which I have been pressing on you . They are very important -- and sorry I am that you can not feel them sufficiently to act upon them . My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration . I want you to save yourself from greater pain . Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me . "
103758	103799	103818	103818	Emma	128	" You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life-- Want gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I do for you!--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been ! "
103837	103848	103850	103850	she	128	" There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart , "
103855	104011	103850	103850	she	128	" There is nothing to be compared to it . Warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , I am sure it will . It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives Isabella all her popularity.-- I have it not -- but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives . Dear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing . Oh ! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a hundred such -- And for a wife-- a sensible man 's wife -- it is invaluable . I mention no names ; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet ! "
104268	104276	104277	104277	She	128	" elegantly dressed , and very pleasing . "
104535	104541	104543	104543	Harriet	115	" Well , Miss Woodhouse , "
104563	104588	104543	104543	Harriet	115	" Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh , ) what do you think of her?-- Is not she very charming ? "
104599	104612	104543	104543	Harriet	115	" Oh ! yes -- very -- a very pleasing young woman . "
104613	104622	104543	104543	Harriet	115	" I think her beautiful , quite beautiful . "
104623	104635	104543	104543	Harriet	115	" Very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown . "
104636	104651	104543	104543	Harriet	115	" I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love . "
104652	104675	104543	104543	Harriet	115	" Oh ! no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune ; and she came in his way . "
104676	104681	104683	104683	Harriet	115	" I dare say , "
104688	104700	104683	104683	Harriet	115	" I dare say she was very much attached to him . "
104701	104742	104543	104543	Harriet	115	" Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man 's fate to marry the woman who loves him best . Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have . "
104743	104746	104748	104748	Harriet	115	" Yes , "
104751	104877	104748	104748	Harriet	115	" and well she might , nobody could ever have a better . Well , I wish them happy with all my heart . And now , Miss Woodhouse , I do not think I shall mind seeing them again . He is just as superior as ever;--but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing . No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery . To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort!-- She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves . Happy creature ! He called her ` Augusta . ' How delightful ! "
105124	105130	105179	105179	she	211	" My brother Mr. Suckling 's seat;"--a
105185	105219	105179	105179	she	211	" Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at Maple Grove ; her sister 's favourite room . "--
105224	105239	105220	105221	Mr. Elton	100	to.--"Was not it astonishingly like?-- She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove . "
105240	105401	105418	105419	Mrs. Elton	211	" And the staircase -- You know , as I came in , I observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house . I really could not help exclaiming ! I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove . I have spent so many happy months there ! ( with a little sigh of sentiment ) . A charming place , undoubtedly . Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home . Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind . I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony . "
105429	105541	105418	105419	Mrs. Elton	211	" So extremely like Maple Grove ! And it is not merely the house-- the grounds , I assure you , as far as I could observe , are strikingly like . The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way -- just across the lawn ; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind ! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place . People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style . "
105596	105623	106507	106508	Mrs. Elton	211	" When you have seen more of this country , I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield . Surry is full of beauties . "
105624	105653	105742	105743	Mrs. Elton	211	" Oh ! yes , I am quite aware of that . It is the garden of England , you know . Surry is the garden of England . "
105654	105686	106507	106508	Mrs. Elton	211	" Yes ; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction . Many counties , I believe , are called the garden of England , as well as Surry . "
105687	105694	105696	105697	Mrs. Elton	211	" No , I fancy not , "
105705	105716	105696	105697	Mrs. Elton	211	" I never heard any county but Surry called so . "
105721	105740	105742	105743	Mrs. Elton	211	" My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest , "
105745	105940	105742	105743	Mrs. Elton	211	" and that will be our time for exploring . While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say . They will have their barouche - landau , of course , which holds four perfectly ; and therefore , without saying any thing of _ our _ carriage , we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well . They would hardly come in their chaise , I think , at that season of the year . Indeed , when the time draws on , I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable . When people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring . We explored to King's - Weston twice last summer , in that way , most delightfully , just after their first having the barouche - landau . You have many parties of that kind here , I suppose , Miss Woodhouse , every summer ? "
105941	105995	106507	106508	Mrs. Elton	211	" No ; not immediately here . We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure . "
105996	106234	105742	105743	Mrs. Elton	211	" Ah ! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort . Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am . I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove . Many a time has Selina said , when she has been going to Bristol , ` I really can not get this girl to move from the house . I absolutely must go in by myself , though I hate being stuck up in the barouche - landau without a companion ; but Augusta , I believe , with her own good - will , would never stir beyond the park paling . ' Many a time has she said so ; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion . I think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little . I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse-- ( looking towards Mr. Woodhouse ) , Your father 's state of health must be a great drawback . Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should . Let me recommend Bath to you . I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good . "
106235	106284	106507	106508	Mrs. Elton	211	" My father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr. Perry , whose name , I dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now . "
106285	106486	105742	105743	Mrs. Elton	211	" Ah ! that 's a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give . In my Bath life , I have seen such instances of it ! And it is so cheerful a place , that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse 's spirits , which , I understand , are sometimes much depressed . And as to its recommendations to _ you _ , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them . The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood . It would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place . A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , Mrs. Partridge , the lady I have always resided with when in Bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with . "
106588	106618	106584	106585	Mrs. Elton	211	" but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father . "
106634	106671	106584	106585	Mrs. Elton	211	" I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs. Elton . Upon these occasions , a lady 's character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer . "
106672	107088	106584	106585	Mrs. Elton	211	" Oh ! no , indeed ; I must protest against any such idea . A superior performer!--very far from it , I assure you . Consider from how partial a quarter your information came . I am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _ mediocre _ to the last degree . You , Miss Woodhouse , I well know , play delightfully . I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into . I absolutely can not do without music . It is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at Maple Grove and in Bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice . I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the house too -- knowing what I had been accustomed to -- of course he was not wholly without apprehension . When he was speaking of it in that way , I honestly said that _ the _ _ world _ I could give up -- parties , balls , plays -- for I had no fear of retirement . Blessed with so many resources within myself , the world was not necessary to _ me _ . I could do very well without it . To those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent . And as to smaller - sized rooms than I had been used to , I really could not give it a thought . I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description . Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove ; but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , nor were spacious apartments . ` But , ' said I , ` to be quite honest , I do not think I can live without something of a musical society . I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me . ' "
107089	107095	107097	107097	Emma	128	" We can not suppose , "
107101	107146	107097	107097	Emma	128	" that Mr. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _ very _ musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive . "
107147	107287	106584	106585	Mrs. Elton	211	" No , indeed , I have no doubts at all on that head . I am delighted to find myself in such a circle . I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together . I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours . Will not it be a good plan ? If _ we _ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies . Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _ me _ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know-- there is a sad story against them , in general . They are but too apt to give up music . "
107288	107308	107097	107097	Emma	128	" But you , who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger , surely ? "
107309	107439	106584	106585	Mrs. Elton	211	" I should hope not ; but really when I look around among my acquaintance , I tremble . Selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly . And the same may be said of Mrs. Jeffereys -- Clara Partridge , that was -- and of the two Milmans , now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper ; and of more than I can enumerate . Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright . I used to be quite angry with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention . I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper . "
107440	107448	107450	107450	Emma	128	" But every thing of that kind , "
107452	107461	107450	107450	Emma	128	" will soon be in so regular a train-- "
107462	107465	107467	107468	Mrs. Elton	211	" Well , "
107472	107477	107467	107468	Mrs. Elton	211	" we shall see . "
107509	107517	107519	107519	she	211	" We have been calling at Randalls , "
107521	107599	107519	107519	she	211	" and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be . I like them extremely . Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature-- quite a first - rate favourite with me already , I assure you . And _ she _ appears so truly good -- there is something so motherly and kind - hearted about her , that it wins upon one directly . She was your governess , I think ? "
107622	107649	107618	107618	she	211	" Having understood as much , I was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like ! But she is really quite the gentlewoman . "
107650	107656	107658	107658	Emma	128	" Mrs. Weston 's manners , "
107660	107685	107658	107658	Emma	128	" were always particularly good . Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman . "
107686	107699	107618	107618	she	211	" And who do you think came in while we were there ? "
107720	107723	107725	107726	Mrs. Elton	211	" Knightley ! "
107728	107837	107725	107726	Mrs. Elton	211	" Knightley himself!--Was not it lucky?--for , not being within when he called the other day , I had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr. E. 's , I had a great curiosity . ` My friend Knightley ' had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend . Knightley is quite the gentleman . I like him very much . Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman - like man . "
107857	107861	107863	107863	her	128	" Insufferable woman ! "
107867	108092	107863	107863	her	128	" Worse than I had supposed . Absolutely insufferable ! Knightley!--I could not have believed it . Knightley!--never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman ! A little upstart , vulgar being , with her Mr. E. , and her _ caro _ _ sposo _ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery . Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman ! I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady . I could not have believed it ! And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club ! One would fancy we were bosom friends ! And Mrs. Weston!-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman ! Worse and worse . I never met with her equal . Much beyond my hopes . Harriet is disgraced by any comparison . Oh ! what would Frank Churchill say to her , if he were here ? How angry and how diverted he would be ! Ah ! there I am-- thinking of him directly . Always the first person to be thought of ! How I catch myself out ! Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind!"--
108135	108141	108142	108142	he	434	" Well , my dear , "
108146	108335	108142	108142	he	434	" considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you . She speaks a little too quick . A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear . But I believe I am nice ; I do not like strange voices ; and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor . However , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife . Though I think he had better not have married . I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion ; I said that I hoped I _ should _ in the course of the summer . But I ought to have gone before . Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss . Ah ! it shews what a sad invalid I am ! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane . "
108336	108352	108106	108106	her	1840	" I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir . Mr. Elton knows you . "
108353	108382	108142	108142	he	434	" Yes : but a young lady -- a bride -- I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible . It was being very deficient . "
108383	108440	108106	108106	her	1840	" But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _ bride _ ? It ought to be no recommendation to _ you _ . It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them . "
108441	108514	108142	108142	he	434	" No , my dear , I never encouraged any body to marry , but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady -- and a bride , especially , is never to be neglected . More is avowedly due to _ her _ . A bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may . "
108515	108557	108106	108106	her	1840	" Well , papa , if this is not encouragement to marry , I do not know what is . And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies . "
108558	108594	108595	108595	Emma	128	" My dear , you do not understand me . This is a matter of mere common politeness and good - breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry . "
108895	108903	108893	108893	her	90	" very pleasant and very elegantly dressed . "
109221	109361	109212	109213	Mrs. Elton	211	" Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents . I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well . I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point . Oh ! she is absolutely charming ! You will laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.-- And her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her . We must bring her forward . Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet ,
109397	109397	109393	109395	sweet Jane Fairfax	157	"
109398	109410	109412	109412	Emma	128	" I can not think there is any danger of it , "
109416	109456	109393	109395	sweet Jane Fairfax	157	" and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax 's situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown . "
109457	109597	109393	109395	sweet Jane Fairfax	157	" Oh ! but dear Miss Woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end ! And I think she feels it . I am sure she does . She is very timid and silent . One can see that she feels the want of encouragement . I like her the better for it . I must confess it is a recommendation to me . I am a great advocate for timidity -- and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing . Oh ! I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express . "
109598	109640	109393	109395	sweet Jane Fairfax	157	" You appear to feel a great deal -- but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax 's acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than"--
109641	110016	109393	109395	sweet Jane Fairfax	157	" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act . You and I need not be afraid . If _ we _ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations . _ We _ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _ we _ live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _ more _ than Jane Fairfax to partake of it . I have no idea of that sort of thing . It is not likely that I _ should _ , considering what I have been used to . My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense . Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be-- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr. Suckling , in income.--However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation . My acquaintance is so very extensive , that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her , of course , very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us . I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties . "
110017	110020	109393	109395	sweet Jane Fairfax	157	" Poor Jane Fairfax!"--thought
110021	110096	109393	109395	sweet Jane Fairfax	157	Emma.--"You have not deserved this . You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax . ' Heavens ! Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me!-- But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman 's tongue ! "
110120	110125	109393	109395	sweet Jane Fairfax	157	" dear Miss Woodhouse . "
110326	110336	110320	110321	the Vicarage	858	" She is a riddle , quite a riddle ! "
110338	110390	110320	110321	the Vicarage	858	she.--"To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort ! And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton 's notice and the penury of her conversation , rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real , generous affection . "
110487	110504	110506	110506	Emma	128	" She must have some motive , more powerful than appears , for refusing this invitation , "
110510	110575	110506	110506	Emma	128	" She must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the Campbells or herself . There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere.-- She is _ not _ to be with the _ Dixons _ . The decree is issued by somebody . But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle . "
110608	110675	110506	110506	Emma	128	" We can not suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma -- but it is better than being always at home . Her aunt is a good creature , but , as a constant companion , must be very tiresome . We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to . "
110676	110684	110686	110687	Mr. Knightley	97	" You are right , Mrs. Weston , "
110690	110747	110686	110687	Mr. Knightley	97	" Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton . Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her . But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton , which nobody else pays her . "
110778	110812	110774	110774	she	128	" Such attentions as Mrs. Elton 's , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax . Mrs. Elton 's invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting . "
110813	110819	110821	110822	Mrs. Weston	169	" I should not wonder , "
110824	110893	110821	110822	Mrs. Weston	169	" if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt 's eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton 's civilities for her . Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change . "
110914	111102	110911	110911	he	1868	" Another thing must be taken into consideration too -- Mrs. Elton does not talk _ to _ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _ of _ her . We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other-- a something more early implanted . We can not give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before . We feel things differently . And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to . Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton 's way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness . "
111103	111114	111116	111116	Emma	128	" I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax , "
111140	111143	111144	111144	he	130	" Yes , "
111147	111159	111144	111144	he	130	" any body may know how highly I think of her . "
111160	111164	111166	111166	Emma	128	" And yet , "
111194	111225	111192	111192	she	128	on--"And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is . The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other . "
111267	111290	111291	111291	He	97	" Oh ! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand . Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago . "
111316	111358	111313	111313	he	97	" That will never be , however , I can assure you . Miss Fairfax , I dare say , would not have me if I were to ask her -- and I am very sure I shall never ask her . "
111375	111391	111359	111359	Emma	128	" You are not vain , Mr. Knightley . I will say that for you . "
111417	111430	111399	111399	he	97	" So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ? "
111431	111530	111399	111399	he	97	" No indeed I have not . You have scolded me too much for match - making , for me to presume to take such a liberty with you . What I said just now , meant nothing . One says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning . Oh ! no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body . You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married . "
111544	111580	111540	111540	his	97	" No , Emma , I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way , I assure you . "
111585	111624	111540	111540	his	97	" Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman -- but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect . She has a fault . She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife . "
111638	111641	111643	111643	she	128	" Well , "
111645	111656	111643	111643	she	128	" and you soon silenced Mr. Cole , I suppose ? "
111657	111699	111399	111399	he	97	" Yes , very soon . He gave me a quiet hint ; I told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon and said no more . Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours . "
111700	111925	111643	111643	she	128	" In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton , who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world ! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles-- what she calls them ! How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ? She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do for Mr. Cole ? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . Mrs. Weston , your argument weighs most with me . I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax 's mind over Mrs. Elton . I have no faith in Mrs. Elton 's acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding . I can not imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau . "
111926	111932	111934	111935	Mr. Knightley--"I	279	" Jane Fairfax has feeling , "
111935	112036	111643	111643	she	128	Knightley--"I do not accuse her of want of feeling . Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness . She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be -- And I love an open temper . No -- till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head . I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond . "
112037	112043	112045	112045	Emma	128	" Well , Mrs. Weston , "
112052	112066	112045	112045	Emma	128	" what do you say now to Mr. Knightley 's marrying Jane Fairfax ? "
112067	112119	111643	111643	she	128	" Why , really , dear Emma , I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _ not _ being in love with her , that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last . Do not beat me . "
112183	112190	112192	112192	she	128	" I see how it is , "
112194	112268	112192	112192	she	128	" I see what a life I am to lead among you . Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated . We really seem quite the fashion . If this is living in the country , it is nothing very formidable . From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss . "
112612	112662	112597	112597	Emma	128	" She would rather not be in his company more than she could help . She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable . If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home . "
112780	112786	112788	112788	she	128	" This is very true , "
112790	112854	112788	112788	she	128	" at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful.--Of the same age-- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend.-- She will never like me now . I have neglected her too long . But I will shew her greater attention than I have done . "
113316	113352	113313	113313	he	97	" I hope you did not venture far , Miss Fairfax , this morning , or I am sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time . I hope you turned directly . "
113353	113363	113365	113365	she	157	" I went only to the post - office , "
113367	113414	113365	113365	she	157	" and reached home before the rain was much . It is my daily errand . I always fetch the letters when I am here . It saves trouble , and is a something to get me out . A walk before breakfast does me good . "
113415	113427	113313	113313	he	97	" Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine . "
113428	113442	113365	113365	she	157	" No , but it did not absolutely rain when I set out . "
113451	113536	113443	113445	Mr. John Knightley	97	" That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before . The post - office has a great charm at one period of our lives . When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for . "
113548	113586	113313	113313	he	97	" I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I can not expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters . "
113587	113617	113313	113313	he	97	" Indifferent ! Oh ! no -- I never conceived you could become indifferent . Letters are no matter of indifference ; they are generally a very positive curse . "
113618	113633	113313	113313	he	97	" You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship . "
113634	113646	113648	113648	he	1903	" I have often thought them the worst of the two , "
113651	113667	113648	113648	he	1903	" Business , you know , may bring money , but friendship hardly ever does . "
113668	113796	113313	113313	he	97	" Ah ! you are not serious now . I know Mr. John Knightley too well-- I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body . I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation . You have every body dearest to you always at hand , I , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections , a post - office , I think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day . "
113797	113814	113816	113817	John Knightley	97	" When I talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years , "
113819	113899	113816	113817	John Knightley	97	" I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings . I consider one as including the other . Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle -- but that is not the change I had in view for you . As an old friend , you will allow me to hope , Miss Fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have . "
113914	113917	113313	113313	he	97	" thank you "
113998	114052	113992	113992	his	91	" I am very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain . Young ladies should take care of themselves.-- Young ladies are delicate plants . They should take care of their health and their complexion . My dear , did you change your stockings ? "
114053	114075	113992	113992	his	91	" Yes , sir , I did indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me . "
114076	114163	113992	113992	his	91	" My dear Miss Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for.-- I hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well . They are some of my very old friends . I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour . You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure . My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield . "
114216	114264	114209	114209	her	211	" My dear Jane , what is this I hear?--Going to the post - office in the rain!--This must not be , I assure you.--You sad girl , how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you . "
114278	114331	114209	114209	her	211	" Oh ! do not tell _ me _ . You really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself.--To the post - office indeed ! Mrs. Weston , did you ever hear the like ? You and I must positively exert our authority . "
114332	114336	114338	114339	Mrs. Weston	169	" My advice , "
114344	114457	114338	114339	Mrs. Weston	169	" I certainly do feel tempted to give . Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks.-- Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year . The spring I always think requires more than common care . Better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again . Now do not you feel that you had ? Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable . You look as if you would not do such a thing again . "
114458	114474	114477	114478	Mrs. Elton	211	" Oh ! she _ shall _ _ not _ do such a thing again , "
114480	114491	114477	114478	Mrs. Elton	211	" We will not allow her to do such a thing again:"--
114494	114573	114209	114209	her	211	significantly--"there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed . I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning ( one of our men , I forget his name ) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you . That will obviate all difficulties you know ; and from _ us _ I really think , my dear Jane , you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation . "
114574	114580	114582	114582	Jane	157	" You are extremely kind , "
114584	114638	114582	114582	Jane	157	" but I can not give up my early walk . I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can , I must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before . "
114639	114731	114209	114209	her	211	" My dear Jane , say no more about it . The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master . You know , Mrs. Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves . But I do flatter myself , my dear Jane , that my influence is not entirely worn out . If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . "
114732	114736	114738	114738	Jane	157	" Excuse me , "
114741	114791	114738	114738	Jane	157	" I can not by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant . If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama 's . "
114792	114815	114209	114209	her	211	" Oh ! my dear ; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness to employ our men . "
114842	114852	114854	114854	she.--	157	" The post - office is a wonderful establishment ! "
114855	114887	114854	114854	she.--	157	" The regularity and despatch of it ! If one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing ! "
114888	114896	114833	114833	she	157	" It is certainly very well regulated . "
114897	114968	114854	114854	she.--	157	" So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears ! So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost ! And when one considers the variety of hands , and of bad hands too , that are to be deciphered , it increases the wonder . "
114969	114998	115000	115000	he	97	" The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them . If you want any farther explanation , "
115004	115031	115000	115000	he	97	" they are paid for it . That is the key to a great deal of capacity . The public pays and must be served well . "
115047	115054	115056	115057	John Knightley	97	" I have heard it asserted , "
115059	115144	115056	115057	John Knightley	97	" that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough . But for that reason , I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get . Isabella and Emma , I think , do write very much alike . I have not always known their writing apart . "
115145	115148	115150	115151	his brother	837	" Yes , "
115154	115174	115150	115151	his brother	837	" there is a likeness . I know what you mean -- but Emma 's hand is the strongest . "
115175	115183	115185	115186	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Isabella and Emma both write beautifully , "
115188	115198	115185	115186	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" and always did . And so does poor Mrs. Weston"--with
115209	115216	115222	115223	Mrs. Weston	169	" I never saw any gentleman 's handwriting"--Emma
115249	115321	115244	115244	her	169	" Now , how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend-- your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way , I suppose , if I were very bad.--No , I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress . I certainly get better and better.--Now for it . "
115329	115345	115327	115327	Emma	128	again--"Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman 's hands I ever saw . "
115346	115353	115355	115356	Mr. Knightley	97	" I do not admire it , "
115358	115374	115355	115356	Mr. Knightley	97	" It is too small-- wants strength . It is like a woman 's writing . "
115392	115426	115384	115384	They	1913	" No , it by no means wanted strength-- it was not a large hand , but very clear and certainly strong . Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce ? "
115448	115457	115459	115459	Emma	128	" If we were in the other room , "
115461	115502	115459	115459	Emma	128	" if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen . I have a note of his.-- Do not you remember , Mrs. Weston , employing him to write for you one day ? "
115503	115510	115384	115384	They	1913	" He chose to say he was employed"--
115511	115532	115459	115459	Emma	128	" Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley . "
115533	115547	115549	115550	Mr. Knightley	97	" Oh ! when a gallant young man , like Mr. Frank Churchill , "
115553	115574	115549	115550	Mr. Knightley	97	" writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best . "
115616	115632	115594	115595	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" Must I go first ? I really am ashamed of always leading the way . "
115981	115987	115989	115989	she	157	" Here is April come ! "
115991	116005	115989	115989	she	157	" I get quite anxious about you . June will soon be here . "
116006	116028	115944	115944	them	1916	" But I have never fixed on June or any other month -- merely looked forward to the summer in general . "
116029	116038	115989	115989	she	157	" But have you really heard of nothing ? "
116039	116057	115944	115944	them	1916	" I have not even made any inquiry ; I do not wish to make any yet . "
116058	116085	115989	115989	she	157	" Oh ! my dear , we can not begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing . "
116086	116091	116093	116093	Jane	157	" I not aware ! "
116099	116115	116093	116093	Jane	157	" dear Mrs. Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ? "
116116	116230	115989	115989	she	157	" But you have not seen so much of the world as I have . You do not know how many candidates there always are for the _ first _ situations . I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove . A cousin of Mr. Suckling , Mrs. Bragge , had such an infinity of applications ; every body was anxious to be in her family , for she moves in the first circle . Wax - candles in the schoolroom ! You may imagine how desirable ! Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge 's is the one I would most wish to see you in . "
116231	116245	116247	116247	Jane	157	" Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer , "
116249	116292	116247	116247	Jane	157	" I must spend some time with them ; I am sure they will want it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself . But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present . "
116293	116364	115989	115989	she	157	" Trouble ! aye , I know your scruples . You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am . I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible . "
116365	116399	116247	116247	Jane	157	" Thank you , but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , I do not wish to be giving any body trouble . "
116400	116482	115989	115989	she	157	" But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us . Your inexperience really amuses me ! A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment 's notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly . "
116483	116567	116247	116247	Jane	157	" Excuse me , ma'am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends . When I am quite determined as to the time , I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed . There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- Offices for the sale-- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect . "
116568	116607	115989	115989	she	157	" Oh ! my dear , human flesh ! You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition . "
116608	116624	116626	116626	Jane	157	" I did not mean , I was not thinking of the slave - trade , "
116628	116710	116626	116626	Jane	157	" governess - trade , I assure you , was all that I had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , I do not know where it lies . But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices , and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do . "
116711	116717	116719	116720	Mrs. Elton	211	" Something that would do ! "
116722	116787	116719	116720	Mrs. Elton	211	" Aye , _ that _ may suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life . "
116788	116849	115989	115989	she	157	" You are very obliging ; but as to all that , I am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , I think , would only be the greater ; I should suffer more from comparison . A gentleman 's family is all that I should condition for . "
116850	117004	116719	116720	Mrs. Elton	211	" I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle . Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is -- I do not know-- if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play;--yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest . "
117005	117025	117027	117027	Jane	157	" You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together , "
117029	117111	117027	117027	Jane	157	" they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs. Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer . For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am , and as I am . "
117112	117124	117126	117127	Mrs. Elton	211	" And I am quite serious too , I assure you , "
117130	117156	117126	117127	Mrs. Elton	211	" in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us . "
117201	117462	117190	117190	her	211	" Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest!--Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature he is;--I assure you I like him excessively . I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me . But this good old Mr. Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner . Oh ! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous . I fancy I am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown . How do you like it?--Selina 's choice -- handsome , I think , but I do not know whether it is not over - trimmed ; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed -- quite a horror of finery . I must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me . A bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery . But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery are every thing . I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin . Do you think it will look well ? "
117749	117762	117743	117743	his	97	" I could not have believed it even of _ him _ . "
117914	117921	117923	117923	he	92	" Read it , read it , "
117925	117948	117923	117923	he	92	" it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma . "
117983	118203	117958	117958	he	92	" Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think . Well , what do you say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I?--Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me?--In town next week , you see -- at the latest , I dare say ; for _ she _ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or Saturday . As to her illness , all nothing of course . But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again , so near as town . They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us . This is precisely what I wanted . Well , pretty good news , is not it ? Have you finished it ? Has Emma read it all ? Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now . I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way . "
118441	118457	118459	118460	Mr. Weston	92	" I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you , "
118483	118496	118497	118497	he	92	" You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume , "
118499	118516	118497	118497	he	92	" and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name . "
118517	118560	118497	118497	he	92	" Oh ! yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance . I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage . "
118561	118652	118497	118497	he	92	" You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy , I am sure.-- He is to be in town next week , if not sooner . We have notice of it in a letter to - day . I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son 's hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to Mrs. Weston . She is his principal correspondent , I assure you . I hardly ever get a letter . "
118653	118725	118497	118497	he	92	" And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her ! Oh ! Mr. Weston-- ( laughing affectedly ) I must protest against that.--A most dangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.--Upon my word , if this is what I am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh ! Mr. Weston , I could not have believed it of you ! "
118726	118812	118497	118497	he	92	" Aye , we men are sad fellows . You must take care of yourself , Mrs. Elton.--This letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs. Churchill 's account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her-- so they are all to move southward without loss of time . "
118813	118825	118497	118497	he	92	" Indeed!--from Yorkshire , I think . Enscombe is in Yorkshire ? "
118826	118844	118497	118497	he	92	" Yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London . a considerable journey . "
118845	118920	118497	118497	he	92	" Yes , upon my word , very considerable . Sixty - five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London . But what is distance , Mr. Weston , to people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother , Mr. Suckling , sometimes flies about . You will hardly believe me-- but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses . "
118921	118930	118932	118933	Mr. Weston	92	" The evil of the distance from Enscombe , "
118935	119051	118932	118933	Mr. Weston	92	" is , that Mrs. Churchill , _ as _ _ we _ _ understand _ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together . In Frank 's last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle 's ! This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word . Certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs. Elton . You must grant me that . "
119052	119173	119270	119271	Mrs. Elton	211	" No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing . I Always take the part of my own sex . I do indeed . I give you notice -- You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point . I always stand up for women-- and I assure you , if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill 's making incredible exertions to avoid it . Selina says it is quite horror to her -- and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety . She always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution . Does Mrs. Churchill do the same ? "
119174	119204	118932	118933	Mr. Weston	92	" Depend upon it , Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did . Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for"--
119211	119241	119205	119206	Mrs. Elton	211	" Oh ! Mr. Weston , do not mistake me . Selina is no fine lady , I assure you . Do not run away with such an idea . "
119242	119269	118932	118933	Mr. Weston	92	" Is not she ? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld . "
119334	119422	119329	119330	Mr. Weston	92	" Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces , as you may suspect-- but this is quite between ourselves . She is very fond of Frank , and therefore I would not speak ill of her . Besides , she is out of health now ; but _ that _ indeed , by her own account , she has always been . I would not say so to every body , Mrs. Elton , but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill 's illness . "
119423	119444	119317	119317	she	211	" If she is really ill , why not go to Bath , Mr. Weston?--To Bath , or to Clifton ? "
119445	119512	119329	119330	Mr. Weston	92	" She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her . The fact is , I suppose , that she is tired of Enscombe . She has now been a longer time stationary there , than she ever was before , and she begins to want change . It is a retired place . A fine place , but very retired . "
119513	119625	119317	119317	she	211	" Aye -- like Maple Grove , I dare say . Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove . Such an immense plantation all round it ! You seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement.-- And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion . Or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life . I always say a woman can not have too many resources -- and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society . "
119626	119636	119329	119330	Mr. Weston	92	" Frank was here in February for a fortnight . "
119637	119692	119317	119317	she	211	" So I remember to have heard . He will find an _ addition _ to the society of Highbury when he comes again ; that is , if I may presume to call myself an addition . But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world . "
119720	119756	119708	119709	Mr. Weston	92	" My dear madam ! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible . Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston 's letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton . "
119769	119775	119777	119777	he	92	" When Frank left us , "
119779	119926	119777	119777	he	92	" it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day 's news doubly welcome . It has been completely unexpected . That is , _ I _ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me . He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding . ` How could he contrive to come ? And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ? ' and so forth -- I always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see . I have observed , Mrs. Elton , in the course of my life , that if things are going untowardly one month , they are sure to mend the next . "
119927	120055	120056	120056	She	1953	" Very true , Mr. Weston , perfectly true . It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _ May _ before Hymen 's saffron robe would be put on for us . Oh ! the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views ! The carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair . "
120077	120366	120056	120056	She	1953	" You were mentioning May . May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is ordered , or has ordered herself , to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe -- in short , to spend in London ; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring-- precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it : days almost at the longest ; weather genial and pleasant , always inviting one out , and never too hot for exercise . When he was here before , we made the best of it ; but there was a good deal of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always is in February , you know , and we could not do half that we intended . Now will be the time . This will be complete enjoyment ; and I do not know , Mrs. Elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house . I think it is so . I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight . I hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy . He is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy . Mrs. Weston 's partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me . She thinks nobody equal to him . "
120367	120454	120056	120056	She	1953	" And I assure you , Mr. Weston , I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour . I have heard so much in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe , that I am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others . I give you notice that as I find your son , so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer . "
120460	120464	120466	120466	he	92	" I hope , "
120469	120697	120466	120466	he	92	" I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill . If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish . You can not be ignorant , Mrs. Elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment I have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her . She was the instigator . Frank 's mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her . Mr. Churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife 's : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence ! And what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood . She was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out - Churchill'd them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , I assure you , she is an upstart . "
120698	120972	120973	120973	They	1954	" Only think ! well , that must be infinitely provoking ! I have quite a horror of upstarts . Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort ; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves ! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them directly . People of the name of Tupman , very lately settled there , and encumbered with many low connexions , but giving themselves immense airs , and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families . A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall ; and how they got their fortune nobody knows . They came from Birmingham , which is not a place to promise much , you know , Mr. Weston . One has not great hopes from Birmingham . I always say there is something direful in the sound : but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans , though a good many things I assure you are suspected ; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother , Mr. Suckling , who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours . It is infinitely too bad . Mr. Suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove , and whose father had it before him -- I believe , at least -- I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before his death . "
121104	121187	121100	121100	he	97	" Well , Emma , I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister 's letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure . My charge would be much more concise than her 's , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them . "
121188	121197	121199	121199	Emma	128	" I rather hope to satisfy you both , "
121201	121231	121199	121199	Emma	128	" for I shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for Isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic . "
121232	121247	121100	121100	he	97	" And if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again . "
121248	121262	121199	121199	Emma	128	" That is very likely . You think so , do not you ? "
121263	121302	121100	121100	he	97	" I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father-- or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately . "
121303	121306	121199	121199	Emma	128	" Increase ! "
121307	121331	121100	121100	he	97	" Certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life . "
121332	121341	121199	121199	Emma	128	" Difference ! No indeed I am not . "
121342	121456	121100	121100	he	97	" There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be . Witness this very time . Here am I come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party!-- When did it happen before , or any thing like it ? Your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it . A little while ago , every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at Mr. Cole 's , or balls at the Crown . The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great . "
121457	121460	121462	121463	his brother	837	" Yes , "
121466	121475	121462	121463	his brother	837	" it is Randalls that does it all . "
121476	121532	121100	121100	he	97	" Very well -- and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way . And if they are , I only beg you to send them home . "
121533	121536	121538	121539	Mr. Knightley	97	" No , "
121541	121563	121538	121539	Mr. Knightley	97	" that need not be the consequence . Let them be sent to Donwell . I shall certainly be at leisure . "
121564	121569	121571	121571	Emma	128	" Upon my word , "
121573	121785	121571	121571	Emma	128	" you amuse me ! I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys . These amazing engagements of mine-- what have they been ? Dining once with the Coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place . I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed . But you , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) who know how very , very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , I can not imagine . And as to my dear little boys , I must say , that if Aunt Emma has not time for them , I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley , who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one-- and who , when he is at home , is either reading to himself or settling his accounts . "
122346	122409	122410	122410	She	128	" He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed-- he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word -- but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry off . "
123501	123506	123507	123507	she	128	" So unreasonably early ! "
123862	123871	123873	123873	he	106	" I think she must be here soon , "
123875	123907	123873	123873	he	106	" I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton , I have heard so much of her . It can not be long , I think , before she comes . "
123926	123957	123913	123913	He	106	" I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her . I have never seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton . I have no business to put myself forward . "
123973	123981	123983	123984	Mr. Weston	92	" But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax ! "
123989	123998	123983	123984	Mr. Weston	92	" We thought you were to bring them . "
124079	124090	124092	124092	Frank	106	" I will see that there are umbrellas , sir , "
124097	124105	124092	124092	Frank	106	" Miss Bates must not be forgotten : "
124159	124298	124136	124136	she	211	" A very fine young man indeed , Mr. Weston . You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him.--You may believe me . I never compliment . I think him a very handsome young man , and his manners are precisely what I like and approve -- so truly the gentleman , without the least conceit or puppyism . You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies-- quite a horror of them . They were never tolerated at Maple Grove . Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them ; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things ! Selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better . "
124350	124428	124343	124344	Mrs. Elton	211	" I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane . Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.-- What a pleasure it is to send one 's carriage for a friend!-- I understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary . You may be very sure I shall always take care of _ them _ . "
124534	124664	124665	124665	She	2016	" So very obliging of you!--No rain at all . Nothing to signify . I do not care for myself . Quite thick shoes . And Jane declares-- Well!--(as soon as she was within the door ) Well ! This is brilliant indeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived , upon my word . Nothing wanting . Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!-- Jane , Jane , look!--did you ever see any thing ? Oh ! Mr. Weston , you must really have had Aladdin 's lamp . Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again . I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance . ` Oh ! Mrs. Stokes , ' said I-- but I had not time for more . "
124672	125287	124670	124671	Mrs. Weston.--	298	" Very well , I thank you , ma'am . I hope you are quite well . Very happy to hear it . So afraid you might have a headache!-- seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have . Delighted to hear it indeed . Ah ! dear Mrs. Elton , so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent time . Jane and I quite ready . Did not keep the horses a moment . Most comfortable carriage.-- Oh ! and I am sure our thanks are due to you , Mrs. Weston , on that score . Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been.-- But two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours . I said to my mother , ` Upon my word , ma'am-- . ' Thank you , my mother is remarkably well . Gone to Mr. Woodhouse 's . I made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl-- Mrs. Dixon 's wedding - present.--So kind of her to think of my mother ! Bought at Weymouth , you know -- Mr. Dixon 's choice . There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time . Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive . My dear Jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two , but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely-- and there was a mat to step upon -- I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh ! Mr. Frank Churchill , I must tell you my mother 's spectacles have never been in fault since ; the rivet never came out again . My mother often talks of your good - nature . Does not she , Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?-- Ah ! here 's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do?-- Very well I thank you , quite well . This is meeting quite in fairy - land!-- Such a transformation!--Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude -- but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look -- how do you like Jane 's hair?--You are a judge.-- She did it all herself . Quite wonderful how she does her hair!-- No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah ! Dr. Hughes I declare-- and Mrs. Hughes . Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.--How do you do ? How do you do?--Very well , I thank you . This is delightful , is not it?--Where 's dear Mr. Richard?-- Oh ! there he is . Do n't disturb him . Much better employed talking to the young ladies . How do you do , Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- Mrs. Otway , I protest!-- and good Mr. Otway , and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do ? How do you all do?--Quite well , I am much obliged to you . Never better.-- Do n't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends ! And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted . No coffee , I thank you , for me -- never take coffee.--A little tea if you please , sir , by and bye,--no hurry -- Oh ! here it comes . Every thing so good ! "
125375	125392	125404	125405	Mrs. Elton	211	" How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?-- How has Wright done my hair?"--with
125409	125514	125404	125405	Mrs. Elton	211	" Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do -- but upon such an occasion as this , when every body 's eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the Westons -- who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour -- I would not wish to be inferior to others . And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.-- So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand.--We shall see if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill . I like him very well . "
125579	125616	125567	125567	Elton	211	" Oh ! you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion?-- I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us . "
125617	125618	125559	125560	Mrs. Elton	211	" Jane!"--repeated
125629	125645	125567	125567	Elton	211	" That is easy -- but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose . "
125646	125654	125656	125656	Emma	128	" How do you like Mrs. Elton ? "
125661	125666	125559	125560	Mrs. Elton	211	" Not at all . "
125667	125672	125559	125560	Mrs. Elton	211	" You are ungrateful . "
125673	125679	125718	125718	him	2021	" Ungrateful!--What do you mean ? "
125687	125713	125718	125718	him	2021	smile--"No , do not tell me -- I do not want to know what you mean.-- Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing ? "
125806	125820	125822	125823	Mr. Weston	92	" And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ? "
125825	125835	125822	125823	Mr. Weston	92	" She will think Frank ought to ask her . "
126715	126724	126707	126707	her	169	" Do not you dance , Mr. Elton ? "
126732	126746	126727	126727	his	100	" Most readily , Mrs. Weston , if you will dance with me . "
126747	126767	126702	126704	gentle Mrs. Weston	169	" Me!--oh ! no -- I would get you a better partner than myself . I am no dancer . "
126768	126776	126778	126778	he	100	" If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance , "
126780	126833	126778	126778	he	100	" I shall have great pleasure , I am sure -- for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert . "
126834	126863	126702	126704	gentle Mrs. Weston	169	" Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- Miss Smith . "
126864	126918	126778	126778	he	100	" Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging-- and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over , Mrs. Weston . You will excuse me . Any thing else I should be most happy to do , at your command -- but my dancing days are over . "
127222	127237	127219	127219	her	128	" Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured , I declare . "
127271	127912	127219	127219	her	128	" Jane , Jane , my dear Jane , where are you?--Here is your tippet . Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet . She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage , though every thing has been done -- One door nailed up -- Quantities of matting -- My dear Jane , indeed you must . Mr. Churchill , oh ! you are too obliging ! How well you put it on!--so gratified ! Excellent dancing indeed!-- Yes , my dear , I ran home , as I said I should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me.--I set off without saying a word , just as I told you . Grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ` Oh ! ' said I , ` I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr. Elton , I do not know who will ask her next , perhaps Mr. William Cox . ' My dear sir , you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am not helpless . Sir , you are most kind . Upon my word , Jane on one arm , and me on the other!--Stop , stop , let us stand a little back , Mrs. Elton is going ; dear Mrs. Elton , how elegant she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train . Quite the queen of the evening!--Well , here we are at the passage . Two steps , Jane , take care of the two steps . Oh ! no , there is but one . Well , I was persuaded there were two . How very odd ! I was convinced there were two , and there is but one . I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style -- Candles everywhere.--I was telling you of your grandmama , Jane,--There was a little disappointment.-- The baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good Mr. Woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again . Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus-- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned!--Well , this is brilliant ! I am all amazement ! could not have supposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since-- Well , where shall we sit ? where shall we sit ? Anywhere , so that Jane is not in a draught . Where _ I _ sit is of no consequence . Oh ! do you recommend this side?--Well , I am sure , Mr. Churchill-- only it seems too good -- but just as you please . What you direct in this house can not be wrong . Dear Jane , how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama ? Soup too ! Bless me ! I should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and I can not help beginning . "
127981	127990	127992	127992	he	97	" They aimed at wounding more than Harriet , "
127994	128006	127992	127992	he	97	" Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ? "
128022	128065	128007	128007	He	97	" _ She _ ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be.--To that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , Emma , that you did want him to marry Harriet . "
128066	128070	128072	128072	Emma	128	" I did , "
128074	128082	128072	128072	Emma	128	" and they can not forgive me . "
128103	128118	128099	128099	he	97	" I shall not scold you . I leave you to your own reflections . "
128119	128137	128007	128007	He	97	" Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong ? "
128138	128163	128099	128099	he	97	" Not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong , I am sure the other tells you of it . "
128164	128216	128007	128007	He	97	" I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton . There is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which I did not : and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet . It was through a series of strange blunders ! "
128217	128303	128099	128099	he	97	" And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs. Elton is totally without . An unpretending , single - minded , artless girl-- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton . I found Harriet more conversable than I expected . "
128325	128360	128099	128099	he	97	" Come Miss Woodhouse , Miss Otway , Miss Fairfax , what are you all doing?-- Come Emma , set your companions the example . Every body is lazy ! Every body is asleep ! "
128361	128366	128368	128368	Emma	128	" I am ready , "
128370	128376	128368	128368	Emma	128	" whenever I am wanted . "
128377	128386	128388	128389	Mr. Knightley	97	" Whom are you going to dance with ? "
128400	128410	128391	128391	She	128	" With you , if you will ask me . "
128411	128415	128417	128417	he	97	" Will you ? "
128423	128456	128388	128389	Mr. Knightley	97	" Indeed I will . You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper . "
128457	128466	128391	128391	She	128	" Brother and sister ! no , indeed . "
130419	130458	130395	130395	Harriet	115	" Miss Woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- I have something that I should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over . "
130497	130512	130513	130513	she	115	" It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish , "
130516	130590	130513	130513	she	115	" to have no reserves with you on this subject . As I am happily quite an altered creature in _ one _ _ respect _ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it . I do not want to say more than is necessary -- I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me . "
130591	130594	130596	130596	Emma	128	" Yes , "
130598	130604	130596	130596	Emma	128	" I hope I do . "
130605	130620	130622	130622	Harriet	115	" How I could so long a time be fancying myself ! . . . "
130626	130848	130850	130850	she	2120	" It seems like madness ! I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet him or not -- except that of the two I had rather not see him-- and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him -- but I do not envy his wife in the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her , as I have done : she is very charming , I dare say , and all that , but I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable -- I shall never forget her look the other night!--However , I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil.--No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment 's pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy -- what I ought to have destroyed long ago -- what I ought never to have kept-- I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke).--However , now I will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown . Can not you guess what this parcel holds ? "
130857	130871	130931	130931	she	115	" Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing ? "
130872	130893	130894	130894	She	2120	" No -- I can not call them gifts ; but they are things that I have valued very much . "
130981	130984	130986	130986	Harriet	115	" Now , "
130988	130995	130986	130986	Harriet	115	" you _ must _ recollect . "
130996	131004	130952	130952	Harriet	115	" No , indeed I do not . "
131005	131190	130986	130986	Harriet	115	" Dear me ! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat -- just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came-- I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister?-- But , as you had none about you , and knew I had , you desired me to supply him ; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me . And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it-- so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat . "
131191	131196	131198	131198	Emma	128	" My dearest Harriet ! "
131211	131312	131198	131198	Emma	128	" you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear . Remember it ? Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic -- I knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me!--Oh ! my sins , my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)-- go on -- what else ? "
131313	131337	131423	131423	Harriet	115	" And had you really some at hand yourself ? I am sure I never suspected it , you did it so naturally . "
131338	131355	131357	131357	Emma	128	" And so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake ! "
131380	131417	131375	131375	she	128	" Lord bless me ! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about ! I never was equal to this . "
131418	131421	131423	131423	Harriet	115	" Here , "
131431	131470	131423	131423	Harriet	115	" here is something still more valuable , I mean that _ has _ _ been _ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did . "
131494	131500	131375	131375	she	128	" This was really his , "
131502	131657	131375	131375	she	128	Harriet.--"Do not you remember one morning?--no , I dare say you do not . But one morning -- I forget exactly the day -- but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _ that _ _ evening _ , he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket - book ; it was about spruce - beer . Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce - beer , and he wanted to put it down ; but when he took out his pencil , there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away , and it would not do , so you lent him another , and this was left upon the table as good for nothing . But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment . "
131658	131664	131666	131666	Emma	128	" I do remember it , "
131668	131730	131666	131666	Emma	128	" I perfectly remember it.-- Talking about spruce - beer.--Oh ! yes -- Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr. Elton 's seeming resolved to learn to like it too . I perfectly remember it.--Stop ; Mr. Knightley was standing just here , was not he ? I have an idea he was standing just here . "
131731	131768	131375	131375	she	128	" Ah ! I do not know . I can not recollect.--It is very odd , but I can not recollect.--Mr . Elton was sitting here , I remember , much about where I am now . "--
131769	131775	131666	131666	Emma	128	" Well , go on . "
131776	131818	131375	131375	she	128	" Oh ! that 's all . I have nothing more to shew you , or to say-- except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and I wish you to see me do it . "
131819	131837	131666	131666	Emma	128	" My poor dear Harriet ! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ? "
131838	131901	131375	131375	she	128	" Yes , simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now , and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them . It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married . I knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them . "
131902	131938	131666	131666	Emma	128	" But , Harriet , is it necessary to burn the court - plaister?--I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court - plaister might be useful . "
131939	131948	131950	131950	Harriet	115	" I shall be happier to burn it , "
131952	131985	131950	131950	Harriet	115	" It has a disagreeable look to me . I must get rid of every thing.-- There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven ! of Mr. Elton . "
131986	131990	131992	131992	Emma	128	" And when , "
131994	132004	131992	131992	Emma	128	" will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill ? "
132092	132108	132080	132080	She	128	" Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so"--and
132131	132137	132123	132123	Harriet	115	" I shall never marry . "
132169	132177	132138	132138	Emma	128	" Never marry!--This is a new resolution . "
132178	132190	132242	132242	She	128	" It is one that I shall never change , however . "
132196	132215	132138	132138	Emma	128	" I hope it does not proceed from-- I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton ? "
132216	132221	132223	132223	Harriet	115	" Mr. Elton indeed ! "
132224	132226	132227	132227	Emma	128	indignantly.--"Oh ! no"--and
132234	132241	132227	132227	Emma	128	" so superior to Mr. Elton ! "
132401	132457	132394	132394	She	128	" Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning . Your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you . Is not it so ? "
132458	132525	132394	132394	She	128	" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , believe me I have not the presumption to suppose-- Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance -- and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world , with the gratitude , wonder , and veneration , which are so proper , in me especially . "
132526	132550	132394	132394	She	128	" I am not at all surprized at you , Harriet . The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart . "
132551	132609	132394	132394	She	128	" Service ! oh ! it was such an inexpressible obligation!-- The very recollection of it , and all that I felt at the time-- when I saw him coming -- his noble look -- and my wretchedness before . Such a change ! In one moment such a change ! From perfect misery to perfect happiness ! "
132610	132874	132394	132394	She	128	" It is very natural . It is natural , and it is honourable.-- Yes , honourable , I think , to chuse so well and so gratefully.-- But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise . I do not advise you to give way to it , Harriet . I do not by any means engage for its being returned . Consider what you are about . Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you . Be observant of him . Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations . I give you this caution now , because I shall never speak to you again on the subject . I am determined against all interference . Henceforward I know nothing of the matter . Let no name ever pass our lips . We were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now.--He is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , Harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity . But take care of yourself . I would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _ him _ , is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value . "
133339	133346	133334	133334	his	321	" Myself creating what I saw , "
133561	133566	133568	133569	Frank Churchill	106	" By the bye , "
133575	133589	133571	133572	Mrs. Weston	169	" what became of Mr. Perry 's plan of setting up his carriage ? "
133598	133611	133590	133591	Mrs. Weston	169	" I did not know that he ever had any such plan . "
133612	133631	133568	133569	Frank Churchill	106	" Nay , I had it from you . You wrote me word of it three months ago . "
133632	133637	133590	133591	Mrs. Weston	169	" Me ! impossible ! "
133638	133705	133568	133569	Frank Churchill	106	" Indeed you did . I remember it perfectly . You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon . Mrs. Perry had told somebody , and was extremely happy about it . It was owing to _ her _ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm . You must remember it now ? "
133706	133719	133590	133591	Mrs. Weston	169	" Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment . "
133720	133766	133568	133569	Frank Churchill	106	" Never ! really , never!--Bless me ! how could it be?--Then I must have dreamt it -- but I was completely persuaded -- Miss Smith , you walk as if you were tired . You will not be sorry to find yourself at home . "
133767	133774	133776	133777	Mr. Weston	92	" What is this?--What is this ? "
133779	133814	133776	133777	Mr. Weston	92	" about Perry and a carriage ? Is Perry going to set up his carriage , Frank ? I am glad he can afford it . You had it from himself , had you ? "
133815	133820	133822	133823	his son	531	" No , sir , "
133827	133923	133822	133823	his son	531	" I seem to have had it from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston 's having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream . I am a great dreamer . I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away-- and when I have gone through my particular friends , then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry . "
133924	133930	133932	133933	his father	526	" It is odd though , "
133935	134057	133932	133933	his father	526	" that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe . Perry 's setting up his carriage ! and his wife 's persuading him to it , out of care for his health-- just what will happen , I have no doubt , some time or other ; only a little premature . What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream ! And at others , what a heap of absurdities it is ! Well , Frank , your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent . Emma , you are a great dreamer , I think ? "
134090	134098	134100	134101	Miss Bates	109	" Why , to own the truth , "
134117	134470	134100	134101	Miss Bates	109	" if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days . Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed . Jane , do n't you remember grandmama 's telling us of it when we got home ? I forget where we had been walking to-- very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls . Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of . At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware . I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not . I am not like Jane ; I wish I were . I will answer for it _ she _ never betrayed the least thing in the world . Where is she?--Oh ! just behind . Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry 's coming.-- Extraordinary dream , indeed ! "
134683	134687	134689	134690	Frank Churchill	106	" Miss Woodhouse , "
134707	134769	134689	134690	Frank Churchill	106	" have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ? It used to stand here . Where is it ? This is a sort of dull - looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer . We had great amusement with those letters one morning . I want to puzzle you again . "
134873	134878	134886	134886	he	91	" poor little boys , "
135248	135254	135245	135245	she	128	" Nonsense ! for shame ! "
135268	135277	135257	135258	Frank Churchill	106	" I will give it to her -- shall I?"--and
135289	135304	135281	135281	Emma	128	" No , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed . "
135451	135462	135441	135441	he	97	" I did not know that proper names were allowed , "
135506	135515	135517	135518	the latter	1662	" Aye , very true , my dear , "
135526	135577	135517	135518	the latter	1662	word--"I was just going to say the same thing . It is time for us to be going indeed . The evening is closing in , and grandmama will be looking for us . My dear sir , you are too obliging . We really must wish you good night . "
135760	135765	135767	135767	he	97	" Pray , Emma , "
135769	135823	135767	135767	he	97	" may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ? I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other . "
135860	135863	135864	135864	she	128	" Oh ! "
135870	135882	135864	135864	she	128	" it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves . "
135883	135887	135888	135888	he	97	" The joke , "
135892	135901	135888	135888	he	97	" seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill . "
136007	136012	136014	136014	he	97	" My dear Emma , "
136022	136044	136014	136014	he	97	" do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ? "
136045	136068	136333	136333	She	2171	" Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ? Oh ! yes , perfectly.-- Why do you make a doubt of it ? "
136069	136091	136014	136014	he	97	" Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ? "
136092	136097	136098	136098	she	128	" Never , never ! "
136104	136132	136098	136098	she	128	eagerness--"Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me . And how could it possibly come into your head ? "
136133	136160	136014	136014	he	97	" I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them-- certain expressive looks , which I did not believe meant to be public . "
136161	136332	136098	136098	she	128	" Oh ! you amuse me excessively . I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do-- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do . There is no admiration between them , I do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather of a totally different nature-- it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of nonsense in it -- but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be . That is , I _ presume _ it to be so on her side , and I can _ answer _ for its being so on his . I will answer for the gentleman 's indifference . "
137026	137038	137040	137040	he	92	" I am glad you approve of what I have done , "
137044	137095	137040	137040	he	92	" But I thought you would . Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers . One can not have too large a party . A large party secures its own amusement . And she is a good - natured woman after all . One could not leave her out . "
137208	137217	137218	137218	she	211	" Is not this most vexations , Knightley ? "
137219	137270	137197	137198	Mrs. Elton	211	cried.--"And such weather for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious . What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done . Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston . "
137271	137279	137281	137282	Mr. Knightley	97	" You had better explore to Donwell , "
137284	137304	137281	137282	Mr. Knightley	97	" That may be done without horses . Come , and eat my strawberries . They are ripening fast . "
137331	137342	137197	137198	Mrs. Elton	211	" Oh ! I should like it of all things , "
137431	137438	137440	137440	she	211	" You may depend upon me , "
137442	137466	137440	137440	she	211	" I certainly will come . Name your day , and I will come . You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax ? "
137467	137475	137477	137477	he	97	" I can not name a day , "
137479	137495	137477	137477	he	97	" till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you . "
137496	137531	137440	137440	she	211	" Oh ! leave all that to me . Only give me a carte - blanche.--I am Lady Patroness , you know . It is my party . I will bring friends with me . "
137532	137540	137542	137542	he	97	" I hope you will bring Elton , "
137544	137557	137542	137542	he	97	" but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations . "
137558	137621	137440	137440	she	211	" Oh ! now you are looking very sly . But consider -- you need not be afraid of delegating power to _ me _ . I am no young lady on her preferment . Married women , you know , may be safely authorised . It is my party . Leave it all to me . I will invite your guests . "
137622	137623	137542	137542	he	97	" No,"--he
137625	137652	137440	137440	she	211	replied,--"there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one is-- "
137653	137661	137663	137664	Mrs. Elton	211	" --Mrs . Weston , I suppose , "
137669	137687	137440	137440	she	211	" No -- Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself . "
137688	137697	137698	137698	she	211	" Ah ! you are an odd creature ! "
137708	137766	137440	137440	she	211	herself.--"You are a humourist , and may say what you like . Quite a humourist . Well , I shall bring Jane with me-- Jane and her aunt.--The rest I leave to you . I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family . Do n't scruple . I know you are attached to them . "
137767	137790	137440	137440	she	211	" You certainly will meet them if I can prevail ; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home . "
137791	137941	137440	137440	she	211	" That 's quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every day:--but as you like . It is to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley ; quite a simple thing . I shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm . Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon . Nothing can be more simple , you see . And Jane will have such another . There is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party . We are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors -- a table spread in the shade , you know . Every thing as natural and simple as possible . Is not that your idea ? "
137942	138013	137440	137440	she	211	" Not quite . My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room . The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , I think is best observed by meals within doors . When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house . "
138014	138070	137440	137440	she	211	" Well -- as you please ; only do n't have a great set out . And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?-- Pray be sincere , Knightley . If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges , or to inspect anything-- "
138071	138085	137440	137440	she	211	" I have not the least wish for it , I thank you . "
138086	138102	137440	137440	she	211	" Well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever . "
138103	138126	137440	137440	she	211	" I will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body 's assistance . "
138127	138231	137440	137440	she	211	" I wish we had a donkey . The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me -- and my caro sposo walking by . I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;--and very long walks , you know -- in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt . "
138232	138291	137440	137440	she	211	" You will not find either , between Donwell and Highbury . Donwell Lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry . Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it . You can borrow Mrs. Cole 's . I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible . "
138292	138373	137440	137440	she	211	" That I am sure you would . Indeed I do you justice , my good friend . Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart . As I tell Mr. E. , you are a thorough humourist.-- Yes , believe me , Knightley , I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme . You have hit upon the very thing to please me . "
138489	138625	138479	138479	He	91	" Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens . He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton , and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma 's , and Harriet 's going there some very fine morning . He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them-- very kind and sensible -- much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining out . "
139283	139434	139244	139244	her	211	of.--"The best fruit in England-- every body 's favourite -- always wholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one 's self -- the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time -- never tired-- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison-- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce -- Chili preferred-- white wood finest flavour of all -- price of strawberries in London-- abundance about Bristol -- Maple Grove -- cultivation -- beds when to be renewed -- gardeners thinking exactly different -- no general rule-- gardeners never to be put out of their way -- delicious fruit-- only too rich to be eaten much of -- inferior to cherries-- currants more refreshing -- only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping -- glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer-- must go and sit in the shade . "
139723	139747	139702	139702	she	327	" Should not they walk ? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens-- all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent . "--The
140194	140219	140223	140223	him	97	" These are my own concerns . I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin . "--She
140348	140368	140334	140334	He	526	" His aunt was so much better , that he had not a doubt of getting over to them . "--Mrs
140784	140791	140793	140793	she	98	" Will you be so kind , "
140795	140906	140793	140793	she	98	" when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly.--I have said nothing about it to any body . It would only be giving trouble and distress . Some are gone to the ponds , and some to the lime walk . Till they all come in I shall not be missed ; and when they do , will you have the goodness to say that I am gone ? "
140907	140924	141020	141020	She	2257	" Certainly , if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone ? "
140925	140944	140793	140793	she	98	" Yes -- what should hurt me?--I walk fast . I shall be at home in twenty minutes . "
140945	140983	141020	141020	She	2257	" But it is too far , indeed it is , to be walking quite alone . Let my father 's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage . It can be round in five minutes . "
140984	141019	140793	140793	she	98	" Thank you , thank you -- but on no account.--I would rather walk.-- And for _ me _ to be afraid of walking alone!--I , who may so soon have to guard others ! "
141032	141062	141027	141027	Emma	128	" That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now . I must order the carriage . The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already . "
141063	141065	140793	140793	she	98	" I am,"--she
141066	141138	141027	141027	Emma	128	answered--"I am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits . Mine , I confess , are exhausted . The greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that I am gone when it is necessary . "
141188	141199	141184	141184	her	128	" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone!"--seemed
141231	141242	141244	141244	Emma	128	" Such a home , indeed ! such an aunt ! "
141255	141279	141247	141247	she	128	" I do pity you . And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more I shall like you . "
141504	141516	141518	141518	Emma	128	" You will soon be cooler , if you sit still , "
141520	141581	141481	141481	he	106	" As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again . I could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming ! You will all be going soon I suppose ; the whole party breaking up . I met _ one _ as I came -- Madness in such weather!--absolute madness ! "
141671	141691	141643	141643	she	128	" No -- he should not eat . He was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter . "
141728	141767	141716	141716	Emma	128	" I am glad I have done being in love with him . I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning . Harriet 's sweet easy temper will not mind it . "
141867	141881	141883	141883	he	106	" As soon as my aunt gets well , I shall go abroad , "
141885	141933	141883	141883	he	106	" I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places . You will have my sketches , some time or other , to look at -- or my tour to read -- or my poem . I shall do something to expose myself . "
141934	141965	141832	141832	He	106	" That may be -- but not by sketches in Swisserland . You will never go to Swisserland . Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England . "
141966	142067	141883	141883	he	106	" They may be induced to go too . A warm climate may be prescribed for her . I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad . I assure you I have . I feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that I shall soon be abroad . I ought to travel . I am tired of doing nothing . I want a change . I am serious , Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy -- I am sick of England-- and would leave it to - morrow , if I could . "
142068	142093	141832	141832	He	106	" You are sick of prosperity and indulgence . Can not you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ? "
142094	142140	141883	141883	he	106	" _ I _ sick of prosperity and indulgence ! You are quite mistaken . I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged . I am thwarted in every thing material . I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person . "
142141	142199	141832	141832	He	106	" You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came . Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well . Another slice of cold meat , another draught of Madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us . "
142200	142220	141883	141883	he	106	" No -- I shall not stir . I shall sit by you . You are my best cure . "
142221	142266	141832	141832	He	106	" We are going to Box Hill to - morrow;--you will join us . It is not Swisserland , but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change . You will stay , and go with us ? "
142267	142284	141883	141883	he	106	" No , certainly not ; I shall go home in the cool of the evening . "
142285	142300	141832	141832	He	106	" But you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning . "
142301	142320	141883	141883	he	106	" No -- It will not be worth while . If I come , I shall be cross . "
142321	142328	141832	141832	He	106	" Then pray stay at Richmond . "
142329	142354	141883	141883	he	106	" But if I do , I shall be crosser still . I can never bear to think of you all there without me . "
142355	142380	141832	141832	He	106	" These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself . Chuse your own degree of crossness . I shall press you no more . "
142482	142499	142475	142475	his	106	" Well;--if _ you _ wish me to stay and join the party , I will . "
143014	143025	143026	143026	They	2274	" Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively . "
143131	143140	143142	143142	he	106	" How much I am obliged to you , "
143144	143182	143142	143142	he	106	" for telling me to come to - day!-- If it had not been for you , I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party . I had quite determined to go away again . "
143183	143233	143123	143123	She	128	" Yes , you were very cross ; and I do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries . I was a kinder friend than you deserved . But you were humble . You begged hard to be commanded to come . "
143234	143251	143142	143142	he	106	" Do n't say I was cross . I was fatigued . The heat overcame me . "
143252	143260	143123	143123	She	128	" It is hotter to - day . "
143261	143275	143142	143142	he	106	" Not to my feelings . I am perfectly comfortable to - day . "
143276	143286	143123	143123	She	128	" You are comfortable because you are under command . "
143287	143291	143142	143142	he	106	" Your command?--Yes . "
143292	143362	143123	143123	She	128	" Perhaps I intended you to say so , but I meant self - command . You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as I can not be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine . "
143363	143406	143142	143142	he	106	" It comes to the same thing . I can have no self - command without a motive . You order me , whether you speak or not . And you can be always with me . You are always with me . "
143407	143435	143123	143123	She	128	" Dating from three o'clock yesterday . My perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before . "
143436	143456	143142	143142	he	106	" Three o'clock yesterday ! That is your date . I thought I had seen you first in February . "
143457	143492	143123	143123	She	128	" Your gallantry is really unanswerable . But ( lowering her voice)-- nobody speaks except ourselves , and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people . "
143493	143503	143505	143505	he	2289	" I say nothing of which I am ashamed , "
143511	143554	143505	143505	he	2289	" I saw you first in February . Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can . Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side , and Dorking on the other . I saw you first in February . "
143558	143618	143123	143123	She	128	" Our companions are excessively stupid . What shall we do to rouse them ? Any nonsense will serve . They _ shall _ talk . Ladies and gentlemen , I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse ( who , wherever she is , presides ) to say , that she desires to know what you are all thinking of ? "
143656	143674	143635	143636	Mrs. Elton	211	" Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ? "
143675	143680	143681	143681	Emma	128	" Oh ! no , no"--cried
143689	143760	143687	143687	she	128	" Upon no account in the world . It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now . Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of . I will not say quite all . There are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet , ) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing . "
143761	143769	143771	143772	Mrs. Elton	211	" It is a sort of thing , "
143775	143819	143771	143772	Mrs. Elton	211	" which _ I _ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into . Though , perhaps , as the _ Chaperon _ of the party-- _ I _ never was in any circle -- exploring parties -- young ladies -- married women-- "
143835	143879	143829	143829	he	450	" Very true , my love , very true . Exactly so , indeed -- quite unheard of-- but some ladies say any thing . Better pass it off as a joke . Every body knows what is due to _ you _ . "
143880	143886	143888	143888	Frank	106	" It will not do , "
143892	144023	143888	143888	Frank	106	" they are most of them affronted . I will attack them with more address . Ladies and gentlemen -- I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way . Here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already , ) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated -- or two things moderately clever-- or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all . "
144024	144030	144032	144033	Miss Bates	109	" Oh ! very well , "
144035	144105	144032	144033	Miss Bates	109	" then I need not be uneasy . ` Three things very dull indeed . ' That will just do for me , you know . I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth , sha n't I ? ( looking round with the most good - humoured dependence on every body 's assent)--Do not you all think I shall ? "
144111	144140	143888	143888	Frank	106	" Ah ! ma'am , but there may be a difficulty . Pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once . "
144184	144236	143888	143888	Frank	106	" Ah!--well -- to be sure . Yes , I see what she means , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) and I will try to hold my tongue . I must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend . "
144237	144243	144245	144246	Mr. Weston	92	" I like your plan , "
144248	144271	144245	144246	Mr. Weston	92	" Agreed , agreed . I will do my best . I am making a conundrum . How will a conundrum reckon ? "
144272	144284	144286	144286	his	92	" Low , I am afraid , sir , very low , "
144287	144302	143888	143888	Frank	106	son;--"but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way . "
144303	144308	144310	144310	Emma	128	" No , no , "
144312	144343	144310	144310	Emma	128	" it will not reckon low . A conundrum of Mr. Weston 's shall clear him and his next neighbour . Come , sir , pray let me hear it . "
144344	144353	144355	144356	Mr. Weston	92	" I doubt its being very clever myself , "
144358	144384	144355	144356	Mr. Weston	92	" It is too much a matter of fact , but here it is.--What two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ? "
144385	144399	144310	144310	Emma	128	" What two letters!--express perfection ! I am sure I do not know . "
144400	144432	144355	144356	Mr. Weston	92	" Ah ! you will never guess . You , ( to Emma ) , I am certain , will never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em - ma.--Do you understand ? "
144494	144537	144489	144490	Mr. Knightley	97	" This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else . _ Perfection _ should not have come quite so soon . "
144538	144551	144553	144554	Mrs. Elton	211	" Oh ! for myself , I protest I must be excused , "
144556	144751	144553	144554	Mrs. Elton	211	" _ I _ really can not attempt -- I am not at all fond of the sort of thing . I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with . I knew who it came from . An abominable puppy!-- You know who I mean ( nodding to her husband ) . These kind of things are very well at Christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer . Miss Woodhouse must excuse me . I am not one of those who have witty things at every body 's service . I do not pretend to be a wit . I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue . Pass us , if you please , Mr. Churchill . Pass Mr. E. , Knightley , Jane , and myself . We have nothing clever to say-- not one of us .
144752	144763	144765	144766	her husband	450	" Yes , yes , pray pass _ me _ , "
144775	144810	144765	144766	her husband	450	" _ I _ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse , or any other young lady . An old married man-- quite good for nothing . Shall we walk , Augusta ? "
144811	144838	144839	144839	Jane	109	" With all my heart . I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot . Come , Jane , take my other arm . "
144853	144857	144859	144860	Frank Churchill	106	" Happy couple ! "
144869	145010	144839	144839	Jane	109	hearing:--"How well they suit one another!--Very lucky -- marrying as they did , upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only knew each other , I think , a few weeks in Bath ! Peculiarly lucky!-- for as to any real knowledge of a person 's disposition that Bath , or any public place , can give -- it is all nothing ; there can be no knowledge . It is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment . Short of that , it is all guess and luck-- and will generally be ill - luck . How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance , and rued it all the rest of his life ! "
145029	145037	145011	145012	Miss Fairfax	157	" Such things do occur , undoubtedly . "--She
145052	145057	145059	145059	he	106	" You were speaking , "
145068	145164	145063	145063	She	157	" I was only going to observe , that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women , I can not imagine them to be very frequent . A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise-- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards . I would be understood to mean , that it can be only weak , irresolute characters , ( whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance , ) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience , an oppression for ever . "
145188	145281	145165	145165	He	106	" Well , I have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever I marry , I hope some body will chuse my wife for me . Will you ? ( turning to Emma . ) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you . You provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father ) . Find some body for me . I am in no hurry . Adopt her , educate her . "
145282	145289	145165	145165	He	106	" And make her like myself . "
145290	145299	145165	145165	He	106	" By all means , if you can . "
145300	145316	145165	145165	He	106	" Very well . I undertake the commission . You shall have a charming wife . "
145317	145361	145165	145165	He	106	" She must be very lively , and have hazle eyes . I care for nothing else . I shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when I return , I shall come to you for my wife . Remember . "
145430	145435	145437	145437	Jane	157	" Now , ma'am , "
145442	145449	145437	145437	Jane	157	" shall we join Mrs. Elton ? "
145450	145523	145524	145524	They	2302	" If you please , my dear . With all my heart . I am quite ready . I was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well . We shall soon overtake her . There she is -- no , that 's somebody else . That 's one of the ladies in the Irish car party , not at all like her.-- Well , I declare-- "
145734	145819	145716	145716	He	97	" Emma , I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but I must still use it . I can not see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance . How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates ? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character , age , and situation?-- Emma , I had not thought it possible . "
145835	145867	145716	145716	He	97	" Nay , how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it . It was not so very bad . I dare say she did not understand me . "
145868	145945	145716	145716	He	97	" I assure you she did . She felt your full meaning . She has talked of it since . I wish you could have heard how she talked of it-- with what candour and generosity . I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome . "
145946	145949	145951	145951	Emma	128	" Oh ! "
145953	145986	145951	145951	Emma	128	" I know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her . "
145987	145992	145994	145994	he	2313	" They are blended , "
145996	146257	145994	145994	he	2313	" I acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good . Were she a woman of fortune , I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner . Were she your equal in situation-- but , Emma , consider how far this is from being the case . She is poor ; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to ; and , if she live to old age , must probably sink more . Her situation should secure your compassion . It was badly done , indeed ! You , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _ some _ , ) would be entirely guided by _ your _ treatment of her.--This is not pleasant to you , Emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but I must , I will,--I will tell you truths while I can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now . "
146813	146835	146805	146806	no one	3098	" How could you be so unfeeling to your father?-- I must , I will tell you truths while I can . "
147027	147035	147036	147036	She	128	" The ladies were all at home . "
147177	147205	147173	147174	Miss Bates	109	" Well , my dear , I shall _ say _ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough . "
147230	147240	147242	147242	she	114	" I am afraid Jane is not very well , "
147244	147316	147242	147242	she	114	" but I do not know ; they _ tell _ me she is well . I dare say my daughter will be here presently , Miss Woodhouse . I hope you find a chair . I wish Hetty had not gone . I am very little able -- Have you a chair , ma'am ? Do you sit where you like ? I am sure she will be here presently . "
147341	147344	147349	147349	her	128	came--"Very happy and obliged"--but
147395	147938	147376	147376	she	128	" Ah ! Miss Woodhouse , how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard-- and are come to give us joy . This does not seem much like joy , indeed , in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be very trying for us to part with her , after having had her so long , and she has a dreadful headache just now , writing all the morning:-- such long letters , you know , to be written to Colonel Campbell , and Mrs. Dixon . ` My dear , ' said I , ` you will blind yourself'-- for tears were in her eyes perpetually . One can not wonder , one can not wonder . It is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , I suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , Miss Woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing her tears)--but , poor dear soul ! if you were to see what a headache she has . When one is in great pain , you know one can not feel any blessing quite as it may deserve . She is as low as possible . To look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation . You will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room-- I want her to lie down upon the bed . ` My dear , ' said I , ` I shall say you are laid down upon the bed : ' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room . But , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well . She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her . You were kept waiting at the door -- I was quite ashamed-- but somehow there was a little bustle -- for it so happened that we had not heard the knock , and till you were on the stairs , we did not know any body was coming . ` It is only Mrs. Cole , ' said I , ` depend upon it . Nobody else would come so early . ' ` Well , ' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now . ' But then Patty came in , and said it was you . ` Oh ! ' said I , ` it is Miss Woodhouse : I am sure you will like to see her . '-- ` I can see nobody , ' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were . ` If you must go , my dear , ' said I , ` you must , and I will say you are laid down upon the bed . ' "
148067	148092	148023	148023	She	157	" It must be a severe trial to them all . She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell 's return . "
148093	148098	148100	148101	Miss Bates	109	" So very kind ! "
148103	148110	148100	148101	Miss Bates	109	" But you are always kind . "
148117	148120	148023	148023	She	157	" always ; "
148135	148145	148023	148023	She	157	" Where -- may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going ? "
148146	148230	148023	148023	She	157	" To a Mrs. Smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children . Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , Mrs. Suckling 's own family , and Mrs. Bragge 's ; but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove . Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove . "
148231	148247	148023	148023	She	157	" Mrs. Elton , I suppose , has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes-- "
148248	148530	148023	148023	She	157	" Yes , our good Mrs. Elton . The most indefatigable , true friend . She would not take a denial . She would not let Jane say , ` No ; ' for when Jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at Donwell , ) when Jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell 's return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over again -- and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than I did . It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take Jane 's answer ; but she positively declared she would _ not _ write any such denial yesterday , as Jane wished her ; she would wait -- and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go . Quite a surprize to me ! I had not the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside , and told her at once , that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge 's situation , she had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it till it was all settled . "
148531	148540	148023	148023	She	157	" You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton ? "
148541	148600	148023	148023	She	157	" Yes , all of us ; Mrs. Elton would have us come . It was settled so , upon the hill , while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley . ` You _ must _ _ all _ spend your evening with us , ' said she--`I positively must have you _ all _ come . ' "
148601	148611	148023	148023	She	157	" Mr. Knightley was there too , was he ? "
148612	148751	148023	148023	She	157	" No , not Mr. Knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though I thought he would come , because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him off , he did not;--but my mother , and Jane , and I , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had . Such kind friends , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one must always find agreeable , though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning 's party . Even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and I can not say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it . However , _ I _ shall always think it a very pleasant party , and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it . "
148752	148777	148023	148023	She	157	" Miss Fairfax , I suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ? "
148778	148785	148023	148023	She	157	" I dare say she had . "
148786	148830	148023	148023	She	157	" Whenever the time may come , it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends -- but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible -- I mean , as to the character and manners of the family . "
148831	148987	148023	148023	She	157	" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse . Yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it . Except the Sucklings and Bragges , there is not such another nursery establishment , so liberal and elegant , in all Mrs. Elton 's acquaintance . Mrs. Smallridge , a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove -- and as to the children , except the little Sucklings and little Bragges , there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere . Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!-- It will be nothing but pleasure , a life of pleasure.--And her salary!-- I really can not venture to name her salary to you , Miss Woodhouse . Even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane . "
148988	148993	148995	148995	Emma	128	" Ah ! madam , "
148997	149038	148995	148995	Emma	128	" if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself , I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned . "
149039	149048	148023	148023	She	157	" You are so noble in your ideas ! "
149049	149059	148995	148995	Emma	128	" And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you ? "
149060	149128	148023	148023	She	157	" Very soon , very soon , indeed ; that 's the worst of it . Within a fortnight . Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry . My poor mother does not know how to bear it . So then , I try to put it out of her thoughts , and say , Come ma'am , do not let us think about it any more . "
149129	149160	148995	148995	Emma	128	" Her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not Colonel and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ? "
149161	149490	148023	148023	She	157	" Yes ; Jane says she is sure they will ; but yet , this is such a situation as she can not feel herself justified in declining . I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton , and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it ! It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh ! no , now I recollect , now I have it ; something happened before tea , but not that . Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea , old John Abdy 's son wanted to speak with him . Poor old John , I have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty - seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed - ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints-- I must go and see him to - day ; and so will Jane , I am sure , if she gets out at all . And poor John 's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he can not keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr. Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond . That was what happened before tea . It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton . "
149800	149919	149795	149796	Miss Bates	109	" Aye , I see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte . What is to become of that?--Very true . Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.-- ` You must go , ' said she . ` You and I must part . You will have no business here.--Let it stay , however , ' said she ; ` give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back . I shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties . '-- And to this day , I do believe , she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter 's . "
150049	150110	150033	150033	Knightley	97	" I would not go away without seeing you , but I have no time to spare , and therefore must now be gone directly . I am going to London , to spend a few days with John and Isabella . Have you any thing to send or say , besides the ` love , ' which nobody carries ? "
150111	150124	150144	150144	he	97	" Nothing at all . But is not this a sudden scheme ? "
150125	150140	150033	150033	Knightley	97	" Yes -- rather -- I have been thinking of it some little time . "
150192	150258	150189	150189	his	434	" Well , my dear , and did you get there safely?--And how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming . Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates , Mr. Knightley , as I told you before . She is always so attentive to them ! "
150812	150947	150800	150801	Mr. Knightley	97	" I am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled . Mrs. Elton is very good - natured and agreeable , and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be . I hope it is a dry situation , and that her health will be taken good care of . It ought to be a first object , as I am sure poor Miss Taylor 's always was with me . You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us . And I hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long . "
151187	151258	151259	151261	Even Mr. Weston	92	" Poor Mrs. Churchill ! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper . It was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults , what would Mr. Churchill do without her ? Mr. Churchill 's loss would be dreadful indeed . Mr. Churchill would never get over it . "--
151273	151285	151263	151263	his	92	" Ah ! poor woman , who would have thought it ! "
151800	151810	151768	151768	She	128	" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ; "
152174	152190	152191	152191	Emma	128	" Miss Fairfax 's compliments and thanks , but is quite unequal to any exercise . "
152382	152443	152368	152368	she	109	" Indeed , the truth was , that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all-- Mrs. Elton , indeed , could not be denied -- and Mrs. Cole had made such a point -- and Mrs. Perry had said so much -- but , except them , Jane would really see nobody . "
152609	152653	152605	152606	Miss Bates	109	" dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing . "
152878	152893	152894	152894	He	92	" could not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak with her . "--
152931	152960	152916	152916	his	92	" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do , if it be possible . Mrs. Weston wants to see you . She must see you . "
152961	152966	152894	152894	He	92	" Is she unwell ? "
152967	153012	152916	152916	his	92	" No , no , not at all -- only a little agitated . She would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _ alone _ , and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come ? "
153013	153048	152894	152894	He	92	" Certainly . This moment , if you please . It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way . But what can be the matter?-- Is she really not ill ? "
153049	153078	152916	152916	his	92	" Depend upon me -- but ask no more questions . You will know it all in time . The most unaccountable business ! But hush , hush ! "
153153	153154	153155	153155	Emma	128	" Now,"--said
153165	153178	153155	153155	Emma	128	" now Mr. Weston , do let me know what has happened . "
153179	153182	153155	153155	Emma	128	" No , no,"--he
153184	153225	153155	153155	Emma	128	replied.--"Don't ask me . I promised my wife to leave it all to her . She will break it to you better than I can . Do not be impatient , Emma ; it will all come out too soon . "
153226	153232	153234	153234	Emma	128	" Break it to me , "
153240	153275	153155	153155	Emma	128	" Good God!--Mr . Weston , tell me at once.--Something has happened in Brunswick Square . I know it has . Tell me , I charge you tell me this moment what it is . "
153276	153284	153155	153155	Emma	128	" No , indeed you are mistaken . "--
153285	153324	153155	153155	Emma	128	" Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square . Which of them is it?-- I charge you by all that is sacred , not to attempt concealment . "
153325	153332	153155	153155	Emma	128	" Upon my word , Emma . "--
153333	153378	153155	153155	Emma	128	" Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour , that it has nothing to do with any of them ? Good Heavens!--What can be to be _ broke _ to me , that does not relate to one of that family ? "
153379	153384	153386	153386	he	2406	" Upon my honour , "
153390	153413	153386	153386	he	2406	" it does not . It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley . "
153424	153429	153430	153430	he	2406	" I was wrong , "
153433	153515	153430	153430	he	2406	" in talking of its being _ broke _ to you . I should not have used the expression . In fact , it does not concern you-- it concerns only myself,--that is , we hope.--Humph!--In short , my dear Emma , there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it . I do n't say that it is not a disagreeable business -- but things might be much worse.--If we walk fast , we shall soon be at Randalls . "
153628	153636	153638	153638	she	128	" Who is that gentleman on horseback ? "
153660	153693	153638	153638	she	128	" I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank , I assure you . You will not see him . He is half way to Windsor by this time . "
153694	153704	153638	153638	she	128	" Has your son been with you , then ? "
153705	153720	153638	153638	she	128	" Oh ! yes -- did not you know?--Well , well , never mind . "
153741	153758	153724	153724	he	92	" Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did . "
153767	153772	153774	153774	he	92	Randalls.--"Well , my dear , "
153780	153820	153825	153825	him	92	room--"I have brought her , and now I hope you will soon be better . I shall leave you together . There is no use in delay . I shall not be far off , if you want me . "--
153837	153853	153834	153834	he	92	room,--"I have been as good as my word . She has not the least idea . "
153887	153954	153883	153883	she	169	" What is it my dear friend ? Something of a very unpleasant nature , I find , has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is . I have been walking all this way in complete suspense . We both abhor suspense . Do not let mine continue longer . It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be . "
153955	153962	153964	153965	Mrs. Weston	169	" Have you indeed no idea ? "
153971	153993	153964	153965	Mrs. Weston	169	" Can not you , my dear Emma -- cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear ? "
153994	154010	153883	153883	she	169	" So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill , I do guess . "
154011	154029	154032	154032	her	169	" You are right . It does relate to him , and I will tell you directly ; "
154043	154079	154032	154032	her	169	" He has been here this very morning , on a most extraordinary errand . It is impossible to express our surprize . He came to speak to his father on a subject,--to announce an attachment-- "
154096	154104	154106	154107	Mrs. Weston	169	" More than an attachment , indeed , "
154109	154147	154106	154107	Mrs. Weston	169	" an engagement-- a positive engagement.--What will you say , Emma -- what will any body say , when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged;--nay , that they have been long engaged ! "
154160	154176	154152	154152	surprize;--and	2409	" Jane Fairfax!--Good God ! You are not serious ? You do not mean it ? "
154177	154184	154186	154187	Mrs. Weston	169	" You may well be amazed , "
154207	154294	154186	154187	Mrs. Weston	169	" You may well be amazed . But it is even so . There has been a solemn engagement between them ever since October -- formed at Weymouth , and kept a secret from every body . Not a creature knowing it but themselves -- neither the Campbells , nor her family , nor his.-- It is so wonderful , that though perfectly convinced of the fact , it is yet almost incredible to myself . I can hardly believe it.-- I thought I knew him . "
154336	154339	154341	154341	she	128	" Well , "
154350	154388	154341	154341	she	128	" this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day , before I can at all comprehend it . What!--engaged to her all the winter-- before either of them came to Highbury ? "
154389	154424	154494	154494	her	128	" Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me , Emma , very much . It has hurt his father equally . _ Some _ _ part _ of his conduct we can not excuse . "
154434	154476	154425	154425	Emma	128	" I will not pretend _ not _ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of . "
154497	154515	154516	154516	she	128	" That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast , of my present perfect indifference , "
154519	154616	154516	154516	she	128	" I will farther tell you , that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance , when I did like him , when I was very much disposed to be attached to him -- nay , was attached -- and how it came to cease , is perhaps the wonder . Fortunately , however , it did cease . I have really for some time past , for at least these three months , cared nothing about him . You may believe me , Mrs. Weston . This is the simple truth . "
154654	154666	154668	154668	she	169	" Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself , "
154670	154711	154668	154668	she	169	" On this point we have been wretched . It was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other -- and we were persuaded that it was so.-- Imagine what we have been feeling on your account . "
154712	154849	154617	154618	Mrs. Weston	169	" I have escaped ; and that I should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself . But this does not acquit _ him _ , Mrs. Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame . What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged , and with manners so _ very _ disengaged ? What right had he to endeavour to please , as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention , as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?-- How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?-- very wrong , very wrong indeed . "
154850	154864	154668	154668	she	169	" From something that he said , my dear Emma , I rather imagine-- "
154865	154916	154617	154618	Mrs. Weston	169	" And how could _ she _ bear such behaviour ! Composure with a witness ! to look on , while repeated attentions were offering to another woman , before her face , and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity , which I can neither comprehend nor respect . "
154917	155009	154668	154668	she	169	" There were misunderstandings between them , Emma ; he said so expressly . He had not time to enter into much explanation . He was here only a quarter of an hour , and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay-- but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said . The present crisis , indeed , seemed to be brought on by them ; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct . "
155010	155087	154617	154618	Mrs. Weston	169	" Impropriety ! Oh ! Mrs. Weston -- it is too calm a censure . Much , much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him , I can not say how it has sunk him in my opinion . So unlike what a man should be!-- None of that upright integrity , that strict adherence to truth and principle , that disdain of trick and littleness , which a man should display in every transaction of his life . "
155088	155131	154668	154668	she	169	" Nay , dear Emma , now I must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , I have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and-- "
155132	155136	155138	155138	Emma	128	" Good God ! "
155143	155185	154668	154668	she	169	her.--"Mrs . Smallridge , too ! Jane actually on the point of going as governess ! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy ? To suffer her to engage herself-- to suffer her even to think of such a measure ! "
155186	155324	154668	154668	she	169	" He knew nothing about it , Emma . On this article I can fully acquit him . It was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.-- Till yesterday , I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans . They burst on him , I do not know how , but by some letter or message-- and it was the discovery of what she was doing , of this very project of hers , which determined him to come forward at once , own it all to his uncle , throw himself on his kindness , and , in short , put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long . "
155331	155340	155342	155343	Mrs. Weston	169	" I am to hear from him soon , "
155345	155490	155342	155343	Mrs. Weston	169	" He told me at parting , that he should soon write ; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now . Let us wait , therefore , for this letter . It may bring many extenuations . It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood . Do n't let us be severe , do n't let us be in a hurry to condemn him . Let us have patience . I must love him ; and now that I am satisfied on one point , the one material point , I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may . They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment . "
155491	155497	155499	155499	Emma	128	" _ His _ sufferings , "
155502	155523	155499	155499	Emma	128	" do not appear to have done him much harm . Well , and how did Mr. Churchill take it ? "
155524	155623	155342	155343	Mrs. Weston	169	" Most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty . Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family ! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived , I suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility;--but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required . What a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave!-- He gave his consent with very little persuasion . "
155624	155627	155629	155629	Emma	128	" Ah ! "
155631	155641	155629	155629	Emma	128	" he would have done as much for Harriet . "
155642	155794	155342	155343	Mrs. Weston	169	" This was settled last night , and Frank was off with the light this morning . He stopped at Highbury , at the Bates 's , I fancy , some time -- and then came on hither ; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle , to whom he is just now more necessary than ever , that , as I tell you , he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.-- He was very much agitated -- very much , indeed -- to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.--In addition to all the rest , there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell , which he had had no previous suspicion of-- and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal . "
155795	155826	155629	155629	Emma	128	" And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells , the Dixons , did none of them know of the engagement ? "
155840	155865	155342	155343	Mrs. Weston	169	" None ; not one . He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves . "
155866	155869	155871	155871	Emma	128	" Well , "
155873	156017	155871	155871	Emma	128	" I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea , and I wish them very happy . But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding . What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage , and treachery?-- To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge us all!--Here have we been , the whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour , with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take the consequence , if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable ! "
156018	156027	156029	156030	Mrs. Weston	169	" I am quite easy on that head , "
156032	156056	156029	156030	Mrs. Weston	169	" I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other , which both might not have heard . "
156057	156084	155871	155871	Emma	128	" You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady . "
156085	156131	156029	156030	Mrs. Weston	169	" True . But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax , I never could , under any blunder , have spoken ill of her ; and as to speaking ill of him , there I must have been safe . "
156172	156330	156151	156152	His wife	2772	" Now , dearest Emma , let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease , and incline him to be satisfied with the match . Let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour . It is not a connexion to gratify ; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that , why should we ? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him , for Frank , I mean , that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for-- and still am disposed to give her credit for , in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right . And how much may be said in her situation for even that error ! "
156331	156336	156338	156338	Emma	128	" Much , indeed ! "
156341	156386	156338	156338	Emma	128	" If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax's.--Of such , one may almost say , that ` the world is not their 's , nor the world 's law . ' "
156402	156507	156389	156390	Mr. Weston	92	" A very pretty trick you have been playing me , upon my word ! This was a device , I suppose , to sport with my curiosity , and exercise my talent of guessing . But you really frightened me . I thought you had lost half your property , at least . And here , instead of its being a matter of condolence , it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I congratulate you , Mr. Weston , with all my heart , on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter . "
156655	156659	156613	156613	he	2413	" Harriet , poor Harriet!"--Those
156776	156788	156772	156772	he	97	" Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith . "--She
156961	156967	156968	156968	she	115	her.--"But , with common sense , "
156971	156982	156968	156968	she	115	" I am afraid I have had little to do . "
157290	157342	157343	157343	Emma	128	" For the present , the whole affair was to be completely a secret . Mr. Churchill had made a point of it , as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost ; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum . "--
157475	157481	157483	157483	Harriet	115	" Well , Miss Woodhouse ! "
157490	157501	157483	157483	Harriet	115	" is not this the oddest news that ever was ? "
157502	157509	157511	157511	Emma	128	" What news do you mean ? "
157531	157605	157483	157483	Harriet	115	" About Jane Fairfax . Did you ever hear any thing so strange ? Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for Mr. Weston has told me himself . I met him just now . He told me it was to be a great secret ; and , therefore , I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you , but he said you knew it . "
157606	157612	157613	157613	Emma	128	" What did Mr. Weston tell you?"--said
157618	157658	157613	157613	Emma	128	" Oh ! he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while . How very odd ! "
157719	157725	157727	157727	Harriet	115	" Had you any idea , "
157729	157759	157727	157727	Harriet	115	" of his being in love with her?--You , perhaps , might.--You ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body 's heart ; but nobody else-- "
157760	157765	157767	157767	Emma	128	" Upon my word , "
157769	157860	157767	157767	Emma	128	" I begin to doubt my having any such talent . Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly-- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr. Frank Churchill 's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax . You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly . "
157861	157864	157866	157866	Harriet	115	" Me ! "
157873	157889	157866	157866	Harriet	115	" Why should you caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill . "
157890	157904	157906	157906	Emma	128	" I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject , "
157910	157944	157906	157906	Emma	128	" but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ? "
157945	157961	157866	157866	Harriet	115	" Him!--never , never . Dear Miss Woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ? "
157966	157969	157971	157971	Emma	128	" Harriet ! "
157977	157993	157971	157971	Emma	128	pause--"What do you mean?-- Good Heaven ! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?-- "
158059	158068	158069	158069	she	115	" I should not have thought it possible , "
158072	158275	158069	158069	she	115	" that you could have misunderstood me ! I know we agreed never to name him-- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else , I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person . Mr. Frank Churchill , indeed ! I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other . I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill , who is like nobody by his side . And that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing!--I am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him . At first , if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened ; that there had been matches of greater disparity ( those were your very words);-- I should not have dared to give way to -- I should not have thought it possible -- But if _ you _ , who had been always acquainted with him-- "
158276	158279	158281	158281	Emma	128	" Harriet ! "
158285	158307	158043	158043	she	115	resolutely--"Let us understand each other now , without the possibility of farther mistake . Are you speaking of -- Mr. Knightley ? "
158308	158345	158069	158069	she	115	" To be sure I am . I never could have an idea of any body else-- and so I thought you knew . When we talked about him , it was as clear as possible . "
158346	158350	158352	158352	Emma	128	" Not quite , "
158358	158413	158352	158352	Emma	128	" for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person . I could almost assert that you had _ named _ Mr. Frank Churchill . I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , was spoken of . "
158414	158425	158069	158069	she	115	" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how you do forget ! "
158426	158511	158352	158352	Emma	128	" My dear Harriet , I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion . I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory . "
158512	158517	158519	158519	Harriet	115	" Oh , dear , "
158521	158640	158519	158519	Harriet	115	" now I recollect what you mean ; but I was thinking of something very different at the time . It was not the gipsies -- it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant . No ! ( with some elevation ) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance-- of Mr. Knightley 's coming and asking me to dance , when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me ; and when there was no other partner in the room . That was the kind action ; that was the noble benevolence and generosity ; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth . "
158641	158645	158647	158647	Emma	128	" Good God ! "
158649	158664	158647	158647	Emma	128	" this has been a most unfortunate-- most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done ? "
158665	158714	158715	158715	She	128	" You would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ? At least , however , I can not be worse off than I should have been , if the other had been the person ; and now -- it _ is _ possible-- "
158726	158735	158736	158736	she	128	" I do not wonder , Miss Woodhouse , "
158739	158912	158736	158736	she	128	" that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body . You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other . But I hope , Miss Woodhouse , that supposing -- that if-- strange as it may appear-- . But you know they were your own words , that _ more _ wonderful things had happened , matches of _ greater _ disparity had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me ; and , therefore , it seems as if such a thing even as this , may have occurred before-- and if I should be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to-- if Mr. Knightley should really -- if _ he _ does not mind the disparity , I hope , dear Miss Woodhouse , you will not set yourself against it , and try to put difficulties in the way . But you are too good for that , I am sure . "
158936	158949	158922	158922	Emma	128	" Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley 's returning your affection ? "
158950	158953	158955	158955	Harriet	115	" Yes , "
158960	158967	158955	158955	Harriet	115	fearfully--"I must say that I have . "
160190	160237	160177	160177	she	115	" Might he not?--Is not it possible , that when enquiring , as you thought , into the state of your affections , he might be alluding to Mr. Martin-- he might have Mr. Martin 's interest in view ? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit .
160238	160273	160177	160177	she	115	" Mr. Martin ! No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin . I hope I know better now , than to care for Mr. Martin , or to be suspected of it . "
160300	160313	160315	160315	she	115	" I never should have presumed to think of it at first , "
160317	160375	160315	160315	she	115	" but for you . You told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine -- and so I have . But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . "
160407	160447	160401	160401	her	115	" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . "
160506	160521	160497	160497	Harriet	115	" She could not compose herself-- Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go;"--with
160555	160566	160551	160551	Emma	128	" Oh God ! that I had never seen her ! "
162764	162768	162769	162769	he	92	" such things , "
162772	162777	162769	162769	he	92	" always got about . "
163103	163121	163123	163124	Mrs. Weston	169	" On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months , "
163126	163196	163123	163124	Mrs. Weston	169	" she was energetic . This was one of her expressions . ` I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'-- and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart . "
163197	163201	163203	163203	Emma	128	" Poor girl ! "
163205	163221	163203	163203	Emma	128	" She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ? "
163222	163415	163123	163124	Mrs. Weston	169	" Wrong ! No one , I believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself . ` The consequence , ' said she , ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought . But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct . Pain is no expiation . I never can be blameless . I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right ; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken , and the kindness I am now receiving , is what my conscience tells me ought not to be . ' ` Do not imagine , madam , ' she continued , ` that I was taught wrong . Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up . The error has been all my own ; and I do assure you that , with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give , I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell . ' "
163416	163420	163422	163422	Emma	128	" Poor girl ! "
163425	163461	163422	163422	Emma	128	" She loves him then excessively , I suppose . It must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement . Her affection must have overpowered her judgment . "
163462	163477	163123	163124	Mrs. Weston	169	" Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him . "
163478	163483	163485	163485	Emma	128	" I am afraid , "
163489	163501	163485	163485	Emma	128	" that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy . "
163502	163553	163554	163554	she	128	" On your side , my love , it was very innocently done . But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before . One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in , "
163557	163751	163554	163554	she	128	" was that of making her _ unreasonable _ . The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been-- that had been -- hard for him to bear . ` I did not make the allowances , ' said she , ` which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits-- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first . ' She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good . She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself . "
163752	163764	163766	163766	Emma	128	" If I did not know her to be happy now , "
163770	163894	163766	163766	Emma	128	" which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , I could not bear these thanks;--for , oh ! Mrs. Weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ) , this is all to be forgotten . You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars . They shew her to the greatest advantage . I am sure she is very good-- I hope she will be very happy . It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers . "
163988	164013	164014	164014	she	169	" We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come , "
164049	164057	164059	164060	Mrs. Weston	169	" Are you well , my Emma ? "
164065	164092	164059	164060	Mrs. Weston	169	" Oh ! perfectly . I am always well , you know . Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible . "
165307	165312	165291	165291	She	128	" How d'ye do 's "
165355	165380	165382	165382	he	97	" He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors . "--She
165542	165562	165530	165530	She	128	" You have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you . "
165563	165567	165569	165569	he	97	" Have I ? "
165577	165582	165569	165569	he	97	" of what nature ? "
165583	165596	165614	165614	he	97	" Oh ! the best nature in the world -- a wedding . "
165617	165633	165614	165614	he	97	" If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already . "
165634	165640	165642	165642	Emma	128	" How is it possible ? "
165674	165706	165662	165662	he	97	" I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened . "
165723	165780	165707	165707	Emma	128	" _ You _ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it -- but--(with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness . "
165832	165864	165818	165818	him	97	" Time , my dearest Emma , time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your father 's sake -- I know you will not allow yourself-- . "
165883	165894	165872	165872	he	97	" The feelings of the warmest friendship -- Indignation -- Abominable scoundrel!"--
165907	165935	165903	165903	he	97	" He will soon be gone . They will soon be in Yorkshire . I am sorry for _ her _ . She deserves a better fate . "
165961	166053	165903	165903	he	97	" You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right.-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion . My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier . "
166054	166057	166059	166059	he	97	" Emma ! "
166066	166070	166059	166059	he	97	" are you , indeed?"--
166073	166200	165903	165903	he	97	himself--"No , no , I understand you -- forgive me -- I am pleased that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret , indeed ! and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!--I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt-- I could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?-- Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature . "
166201	166205	166207	166207	Emma	128	" Mr. Knightley , "
166217	166295	166207	166207	Emma	128	" I am in a very extraordinary situation . I can not let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.-- But I never have . "
166350	166622	166344	166344	She	128	" I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased.-- An old story , probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding . Many circumstances assisted the temptation . He was the son of Mr. Weston -- he was continually here -- I always found him very pleasant -- and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered , and I allowed his attentions . Latterly , however -- for some time , indeed-- I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side . He has imposed on me , but he has not injured me . I have never been attached to him . And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour . He never wished to attach me . It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another.--It was his object to blind all about him ; and no one , I am sure , could be more effectually blinded than myself -- except that I was _ not _ blinded -- that it was my good fortune -- that , in short , I was somehow or other safe from him . "
166676	166761	166673	166673	he	2505	" I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose , however , that I may have underrated him . My acquaintance with him has been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has a chance.--I have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well . "
166762	166773	166775	166775	Emma	128	" I have no doubt of their being happy together , "
166777	166790	166775	166775	Emma	128	" I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached . "
166791	166799	166801	166802	Mr. Knightley	97	" He is a most fortunate man ! "
166807	167108	166801	166802	Mr. Knightley	97	" So early in life -- at three - and - twenty -- a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill . At three - and - twenty to have drawn such a prize ! What years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him!--Assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for Jane Fairfax 's character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour,-- equality of situation -- I mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one-- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _ her _ regard , must , I think , be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune . Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets with a young woman at a watering - place , gains her affection , can not even weary her by negligent treatment -- and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him , they could not have found her superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has only to speak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.-- He had used every body ill -- and they are all delighted to forgive him.-- He is a fortunate man indeed ! "
167109	167118	167175	167175	she	128	" You speak as if you envied him . "
167119	167139	166801	166802	Mr. Knightley	97	" And I do envy him , Emma . In one respect he is the object of my envy . "
167207	167263	167199	167200	Mr. Knightley	97	" You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity.--You are wise -- but _ I _ can not be wise . Emma , I must tell you what you will not ask , though I may wish it unsaid the next moment . "
167264	167279	167280	167280	she	128	" Oh ! then , do n't speak it , do n't speak it , "
167284	167297	167280	167280	she	128	" Take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself . "
167298	167302	167304	167304	he	97	" Thank you , "

167432	167446	167420	167420	Emma	128	spoke--"I should like to take another turn . Mr. Perry is not gone . "
167457	167532	167455	167455	she	128	" I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr. Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me.--I will hear whatever you like . I will tell you exactly what I think . "
167533	167536	167537	167538	Mr. Knightley.--"Emma	366	" As a friend!"--repeated
167538	167605	167606	167606	He	2510	Knightley.--"Emma , that I fear is a word -- No , I have no wish -- Stay , yes , why should I hesitate?-- I have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma , I accept your offer-- Extraordinary as it may seem , I accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend.--Tell me , then , have I no chance of ever succeeding ? "
167625	167630	167632	167632	he	2510	" My dearest Emma , "
167634	167675	167632	167632	he	2510	" for dearest you will always be , whatever the event of this hour 's conversation , my dearest , most beloved Emma -- tell me at once . Say ` No , ' if it is to be said . "--
167680	167684	167685	167685	he	2510	nothing.--"You are silent , "
167692	167703	167685	167685	he	2510	" absolutely silent ! at present I ask no more . "
167734	167743	167744	167744	he	2510	" I can not make speeches , Emma : "
167763	167894	167744	167744	he	2510	convincing.--"If I loved you less , I might be able to talk about it more . But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them . The manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them . God knows , I have been a very indifferent lover.-- But you understand me.--Yes , you see , you understand my feelings-- and will return them if you can . At present , I ask only to hear , once to hear your voice . "
169963	170116	170117	170117	Yours	2540	" I have the greatest pleasure , my dear Emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed . I know what thorough justice you will do it , and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.--I think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again ; but I will not delay you by a long preface.--We are quite well.-- This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday , but it was an ungenial morning ; and though you will never own being affected by weather , I think every body feels a north - east wind.-- I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning , but had the comfort of hearing last night , by Mr. Perry , that it had not made him ill . "
170120	170123	170117	170117	Yours	2540	" A. W. "
170138	173173	170117	170117	Yours	2540	" If I made myself intelligible yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected or not , I know it will be read with candour and indulgence.-- You are all goodness , and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.-- But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent . My courage rises while I write . It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble . I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon , that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.--You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls ; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards . This was the fact . My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question . I shall not discuss it here . For my temptation to _ think _ it a right , I refer every caviller to a brick house , sashed windows below , and casements above , in Highbury . I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness . Every possibility of good was before me , and the first of blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence . If you need farther explanation , I have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband 's son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.--See me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to Randalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid . You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury ; and as _ you _ were the person slighted , you will forgive me instantly ; but I must work on my father 's compassion , by reminding him , that so long as I absented myself from his house , so long I lost the blessing of knowing you . My behaviour , during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you , did not , I hope , lay me open to reprehension , excepting on one point . And now I come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation . With the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think I ought to add , with the deepest humiliation.-- A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it ought.-- In order to assist a concealment so essential to me , I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.--I can not deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but I am sure you will believe the declaration , that had I not been convinced of her indifference , I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.-- Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured playfulness , which exactly suited me . We seemed to understand each other . From our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , I can not say;--when I called to take leave of her , I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth , and I then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree.-- She may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part . I can not doubt it . You will find , whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints , that it did not take her wholly by surprize . She frequently gave me hints of it . I remember her telling me at the ball , that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.-- I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss . While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse , I could deserve nothing from either . Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to . My heart was in Highbury , and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be , and with the least suspicion . If you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account.-- Of the pianoforte so much talked of , I feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F-- , who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her.-- The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice to . You will soon , I earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself.-- No description can describe her . She must tell you herself what she is-- yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit.--Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her.-- She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend . I want to have your opinion of her looks . I know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit . Perhaps it is paid already . Let me hear from you without delay ; I am impatient for a thousand particulars . Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and I am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery . When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle 's generosity , I am mad with joy : but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her , and how little I deserve to be forgiven , I am mad with anger . If I could but see her again!--But I must not propose it yet . My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must still add to this long letter . You have not heard all that you ought to hear . I could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult . , as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects , I should not have presumed on such early measures , but from the very particular circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose . I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty , and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.-- But I had no choice . The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman -- Here , my dear madam , I was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country , and am now , I hope , rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be.--It is , in fact , a most mortifying retrospect for me . I behaved shamefully . And here I can admit , that my manners to Miss W. , in being unpleasant to Miss F. , were highly blameable . _ She _ disapproved them , which ought to have been enough.--My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased ; I thought unreasonably so : I thought her , on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious : I thought her even cold . But she was always right . If I had followed her judgment , and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper , I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.-- Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There _ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis . I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it . She absolutely refused to allow me , which I then thought most unreasonable . Now , however , I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion . While I , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless?--Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury , the truth must have been suspected.-- I was mad enough , however , to resent.--I doubted her affection . I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to Miss W. , as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.-- In short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and I returned the same evening to Richmond , though I might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because I would be as angry with her as possible . Even then , I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but I was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and I went away determined that she should make the first advances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party . Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again . Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls , she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton ; the whole system of whose treatment of her , by the bye , has ever filled me with indignation and hatred . I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known.-- ` Jane , ' indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you . Think , then , what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority . Have patience with me , I shall soon have done.-- She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.-- _ She _ _ felt _ _ the _ _ engagement _ _ to _ _ be _ _ a _ _ source _ _ of _ _ repentance _ _ and _ _ misery _ _ to _ _ each _ : _ she _ _ dissolved _ _ it_.--This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt 's death . I answered it within an hour ; but from the confusion of my mind , and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once , my answer , instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day , was locked up in my writing - desk ; and I , trusting that I had written enough , though but a few lines , to satisfy her , remained without any uneasiness.--I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily ; but I made excuses for her , and was too busy , and -- may I add?-- too cheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor ; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her , my own letters all returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post , stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last ; and adding , that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued , and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible , she now sent me , by a safe conveyance , all my letters , and requested , that if I could not directly command hers , so as to send them to Highbury within a week , I would forward them after that period to her at-- : in short , the full direction to Mr. Smallridge 's , near Bristol , stared me in the face . I knew the name , the place , I knew all about it , and instantly saw what she had been doing . It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy . For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me.--Imagine the shock ; imagine how , till I had actually detected my own blunder , I raved at the blunders of the post.-- What was to be done?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle . Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.-- I spoke ; circumstances were in my favour ; the late event had softened away his pride , and he was , earlier than I could have anticipated , wholly reconciled and complying ; and could say at last , poor man ! with a deep sigh , that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake?--No ; do not pity me till I reached Highbury , and saw how ill I had made her . Do not pity me till I saw her wan , sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone.--I was not disappointed ; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey . A great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure I had to persuade away . But it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment 's uneasiness can ever occur between us again . Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before . A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her.--If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve , I am quite of your opinion.--Miss W. calls me the child of good fortune . I hope she is right.--In one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL .
173436	173447	173449	173449	he	97	" I shall be very glad to look it over , "
173451	173467	173449	173449	he	97	" but it seems long . I will take it home with me at night . "
173491	173500	173501	173501	he	97	" I would rather be talking to you , "
173504	173519	173501	173501	he	97	" but as it seems a matter of justice , it shall be done . "
173532	173570	173520	173520	He	97	" Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman 's letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference . "
173590	173623	173571	173571	He	97	" Humph ! a fine complimentary opening : But it is his way . One man 's style must not be the rule of another 's . We will not be severe . "
173624	173632	173633	173633	he	97	" It will be natural for me , "
173638	173677	173633	173633	he	97	" to speak my opinion aloud as I read . By doing it , I shall feel that I am near you . It will not be so great a loss of time : but if you dislike it-- "
173678	173688	173571	173571	He	97	" Not at all . I should wish it . "
173699	173704	173706	173706	he	97	" He trifles here , "
173708	173787	173706	173706	he	97	" as to the temptation . He knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to have formed the engagement.--`His father 's disposition:'-- he is unjust , however , to his father . Mr. Weston 's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions ; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.--Very true ; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here . "
173788	173795	173797	173797	Emma	128	" And I have not forgotten , "
173799	173826	173797	173797	Emma	128	" how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would . You pass it over very handsomely-- but you were perfectly right . "
173827	173859	173861	173861	he	2543	" I was not quite impartial in my judgment , Emma:--but yet , I think-- had _ you _ not been in the case -- I should still have distrusted him . "
173930	174038	174039	174039	Emma	128	" Very bad -- though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous game . Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.-- No judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his own wishes , and regardless of little besides his own convenience.-- Fancying you to have fathomed his secret . Natural enough!-- his own mind full of intrigue , that he should suspect it in others.--Mystery ; Finesse -- how they pervert the understanding ! My Emma , does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other ? "
174065	174072	174074	174074	she	128	" You had better go on , "
174088	174170	174076	174076	He	2544	" the pianoforte ! Ah ! That was the act of a very , very young man , one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure . A boyish scheme , indeed!--I can not comprehend a man 's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with ; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument 's coming if she could . "
174204	174211	174213	174213	his	106	" I perfectly agree with you , sir,"--was
174216	174230	174213	174213	his	106	" You did behave very shamefully . You never wrote a truer line . "
174269	174383	174261	174261	he	106	" This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could . He should have respected even unreasonable scruples , had there been such ; but hers were all reasonable . We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment . "
174469	174486	174488	174488	his	106	" There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends , the Eltons , "
174490	174536	174488	174488	his	106	observation.--"His feelings are natural.-- What ! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each-- she dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well , he must be a most extraordinary-- "
174537	174552	174488	174488	his	106	" Nay , nay , read on.--You will find how very much he suffers . "
174553	174559	174561	174562	Mr. Knightley	97	" I hope he does , "
174570	174582	174561	174562	Mr. Knightley	97	" ` Smallridge!'--What does this mean ? What is all this ? "
174583	174624	174488	174488	his	106	" She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge 's children-- a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's -- a neighbour of Maple Grove ; and , by the bye , I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment ? "
174625	174664	174561	174562	Mr. Knightley	97	" Say nothing , my dear Emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of Mrs. Elton . Only one page more . I shall soon have done . What a letter the man writes ! "
174665	174679	174488	174488	his	106	" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him . "
174680	174807	174561	174562	Mr. Knightley	97	" Well , there _ is _ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill.--Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her . ` Dearer , much dearer than ever . ' I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker , with his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve . ' Come , he knows himself there . ` Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune . '--Those were Miss Woodhouse 's words , were they?-- And a fine ending -- and there is the letter . The child of good fortune ! That was your name for him , was it ? "
174808	174853	174488	174488	his	106	" You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am ; but still you must , at least I hope you must , think the better of him for it . I hope it does him some service with you . "
174854	175008	174561	174562	Mr. Knightley	97	" Yes , certainly it does . He has had great faults , faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness ; and I am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves : but still as he is , beyond a doubt , really attached to Miss Fairfax , and will soon , it may be hoped , have the advantage of being constantly with her , I am very ready to believe his character will improve , and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants . And now , let me talk to you of something else . I have another person 's interest at present so much at heart , that I can not think any longer about Frank Churchill . Ever since I left you this morning , Emma , my mind has been hard at work on one subject . "
175067	175090	175057	175057	Emma	128	" While her dear father lived , any change of condition must be impossible for her . She could never quit him . "
175467	175477	175479	175479	Emma	128	" Ah ! there is one difficulty unprovided for , "
175481	175502	175479	175479	Emma	128	" I am sure William Larkins will not like it . You must get his consent before you ask mine . "
176698	176703	176669	176669	Patty	197	" Beg her to walk up;"--and
176788	176820	176768	176768	She	109	" This is most kind , indeed!--Miss Woodhouse , it is impossible for me to express -- I hope you will believe -- Excuse me for being so entirely without words . "
177066	177167	177037	177037	she	114	" We can finish this some other time , you know . You and I shall not want opportunities . And , in fact , you have heard all the essential already . I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology , and is not offended . You see how delightfully she writes . Oh ! she is a sweet creature ! You would have doated on her , had you gone.--But not a word more . Let us be discreet-- quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines-- I forget the poem at this moment :
177168	177178	177179	177179	You	2583	" For when a lady 's in the case , "
177187	177187	177179	177179	You	2583	"
177248	177248	177267	177267	she	128	"
177275	177302	177267	177267	she	128	" I mentioned no _ names _ , you will observe.--Oh ! no ; cautious as a minister of state . I managed it extremely well . "
177344	177413	177337	177337	she	128	" Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit?--(here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane . ) Upon my word , Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!-- Oh ! if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst!"--
177427	177464	177416	177417	Mrs. Bates	114	" We do not say a word of any _ assistance _ that Perry might have ; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh ! no ; Perry shall have all the credit . "
177465	177479	177480	177480	she	114	" I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , "
177485	177597	177480	177480	she	114	" since the party to Box Hill . Very pleasant party . But yet I think there was something wanting . Things did not seem -- that is , there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least , but I might be mistaken . However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again . What say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to Box Hill again , while the fine weather lasts?-- It must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _ one _ exception . "
177643	177723	177728	177728	her	109	" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness.--It is impossible to say -- Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane 's prospects-- that is , I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.-- How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.-- Such a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes , indeed.-- Charming young man!--that is -- so very friendly ; I mean good Mr. Perry!-- such attention to Jane!"--And
177787	177847	177779	177780	Mrs. Elton	211	" Yes , here I am , my good friend ; and here I have been so long , that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that I am waiting for my lord and master . He promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you . "
177848	177889	177779	177780	Mrs. Elton	211	" What ! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?-- That will be a favour indeed ! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr. Elton 's time is so engaged . "
177890	178029	178033	178033	her	2591	" Upon my word it is , Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning to night.--There is no end of people 's coming to him , on some pretence or other.--The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion . They seem not able to do any thing without him.--`Upon my word , Mr. E. , ' I often say , ` rather you than I.-- I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if I had half so many applicants . '--Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.--However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all . "
178040	178052	178033	178033	her	2591	Emma--"A congratulatory visit , you know.--Oh ! yes , quite indispensable . "
178061	178097	178053	178054	Miss Bates	109	" He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley ; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.--Mr . E. is Knightley 's right hand . "
178111	178126	178098	178098	Emma	128	" Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk . "
178127	178175	178053	178054	Miss Bates	109	" Oh ! no , it is a meeting at the Crown , a regular meeting . Weston and Cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way . "
178176	178184	178186	178186	Emma	128	" Have not you mistaken the day ? "
178188	178220	178186	178186	Emma	128	" I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to - morrow.--Mr . Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for Saturday . "
178221	178234	178053	178054	Miss Bates	109	" Oh ! no , the meeting is certainly to - day , "
178252	178257	178258	178258	she	211	" I do believe , "
178261	178282	178258	178258	she	211	" this is the most troublesome parish that ever was . We never heard of such things at Maple Grove . "
178283	178290	178292	178292	Jane	109	" Your parish there was small , "
178294	178316	178186	178186	Emma	128	" Upon my word , my dear , I do not know , for I never heard the subject talked of . "
178317	178363	178258	178258	she	211	" But it is proved by the smallness of the school , which I have heard you speak of , as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge ; the only school , and not more than five - and - twenty children . "
178364	178443	178186	178186	Emma	128	" Ah ! you clever creature , that 's very true . What a thinking brain you have ! I say , Jane , what a perfect character you and I should make , if we could be shaken together . My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate , however , that _ some _ people may not think _ you _ perfection already.--But hush!-- not a word , if you please . "
178517	178607	178513	178513	her	1872	" Very pretty , sir , upon my word ; to send me on here , to be an encumbrance to my friends , so long before you vouchsafe to come!-- But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with . You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.-- Here have I been sitting this hour , giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience -- for who can say , you know , how soon it may be wanted ? "
178659	178666	178668	178668	he	100	" When I got to Donwell , "
178670	178708	178668	178668	he	100	" Knightley could not be found . Very odd ! very unaccountable ! after the note I sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one . "
178709	178712	178714	178714	his	100	" Donwell ! "
178715	178739	178668	178668	he	100	wife.--"My dear Mr. E. , you have not been to Donwell!--You mean the Crown ; you come from the meeting at the Crown . "
178740	178872	178714	178714	his	100	" No , no , that 's to - morrow ; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to - day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!-- I went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill - usage , ) which made it so much the worse . And then not to find him at home ! I assure you I am not at all pleased . And no apology left , no message for me . The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.-- Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone . Perhaps to Hartfield , perhaps to the Abbey Mill , perhaps into his woods.-- Miss Woodhouse , this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain it ? "
178898	178904	178906	178907	Mrs. Elton	211	" I can not imagine , "
178921	179059	178906	178907	Mrs. Elton	211	" I can not imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world ! The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E. , he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;-- and his servants forgot it . Depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants , who are all , I have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration . And as for Mrs. Hodges , Wright holds her very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt , and never sent it . "
179060	179066	179068	179069	Mr. Elton	100	" I met William Larkins , "
179071	179183	179068	179069	Mr. Elton	100	" as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour . He did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him . I have nothing to do with William 's wants , but it really is of very great importance that _ I _ should see Knightley to - day ; and it becomes a matter , therefore , of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose . "
179274	179332	179265	179265	she	128	" It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility . Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent . "
179333	179336	179338	179338	Jane	157	" Oh ! "
179362	179497	179338	179338	Jane	157	composure--"there would have been no danger . The danger would have been of my wearying you . You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest-- . Indeed , Miss Woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly , ) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to -- I have not time for half that I could wish to say . I long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself . I feel it so very due . But , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend-- "
179498	179510	179512	179512	Emma	128	" Oh ! you are too scrupulous , indeed you are , "
179520	179548	179512	179512	Emma	128	" You owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even-- "
179549	179587	179736	179736	Jane	157	" You are very kind , but I know what my manners were to you.-- So cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life of deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you . "
179588	179644	179512	179512	Emma	128	" Pray say no more . I feel that all the apologies should be on my side . Let us forgive each other at once . We must do whatever is to be done quickest , and I think our feelings will lose no time there . I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor ? "
179645	179648	179736	179736	Jane	157	" Very . "
179649	179675	179512	179512	Emma	128	" And the next news , I suppose , will be , that we are to lose you-- just as I begin to know you . "
179676	179704	179736	179736	Jane	157	" Oh ! as to all that , of course nothing can be thought of yet . I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell . "
179705	179715	179717	179717	Emma	128	" Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps , "
179719	179730	179717	179717	Emma	128	smiling--"but , excuse me , it must be thought of . "
179739	179814	179736	179736	Jane	157	" You are very right ; it has been thought of . And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ) , that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled . There must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for . "
179815	179854	179855	179856	CHAPTER XVII	128	" Thank you , thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured of.-- Oh ! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!-- Good - bye , good - bye . "
180044	180059	180060	180060	she	128	" She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me , "
180061	180095	180002	180003	Mrs. Weston--	388	continued--"like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis ' Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan . "
180096	180100	180102	180103	Mr. Knightley	97	" That is , "
180105	180135	180102	180103	Mr. Knightley	97	" she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all . It will be the only difference . "
180136	180140	180142	180142	Emma	128	" Poor child ! "
180144	180155	180142	180142	Emma	128	" at that rate , what will become of her ? "
180156	180220	180102	180103	Mr. Knightley	97	" Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands . She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older . I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma . I , who am owing all my happiness to _ you _ , would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them ? "
180227	180258	180221	180221	Emma	128	" But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people . I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it . "
180259	180398	180102	180103	Mr. Knightley	97	" Do you?--I have no doubt . Nature gave you understanding:-- Miss Taylor gave you principles . You must have done well . My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good . It was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me?-- and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner . I do not believe I did you any good . The good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me . I could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least . "
180399	180410	180412	180412	Emma	128	" I am sure you were of use to me , "
180414	180485	180412	180412	Emma	128	" I was very often influenced rightly by you -- oftener than I would own at the time . I am very sure you did me good . And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen . "
180486	180559	180102	180103	Mr. Knightley	97	" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks--`Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor 's leave'--something which , you knew , I did not approve . In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one . "
180560	180578	180412	180412	Emma	128	" What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance . "
180579	180628	180102	180103	Mr. Knightley	97	" ` Mr. Knightley . '--You always called me , ` Mr. Knightley ; ' and , from habit , it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal . I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what . "
180629	180676	180412	180412	Emma	128	" I remember once calling you ` George , ' in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago . I did it because I thought it would offend you ; but , as you made no objection , I never did it again . "
180677	180689	180102	180103	Mr. Knightley	97	" And can not you call me ` George ' now ? "
180690	180727	180728	180728	she	2614	" Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but ` Mr. Knightley . ' I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton , by calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise , "
180734	180771	180728	180728	she	2614	blushing--"I will promise to call you once by your Christian name . I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better , for worse . "
181105	181114	181116	181117	Mr. Knightley	97	" John does not even mention your friend , "
181119	181132	181116	181117	Mr. Knightley	97	" Here is his answer , if you like to see it . "
181181	181191	181193	181194	Mr. Knightley	97	" John enters like a brother into my happiness , "
181196	181255	181193	181194	Mr. Knightley	97	" but he is no complimenter ; and though I well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise . But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes . "
181256	181264	181266	181266	Emma	128	" He writes like a sensible man , "
181275	181344	181266	181266	Emma	128	" I honour his sincerity . It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already . Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him . "
181345	181358	181193	181194	Mr. Knightley	97	" My Emma , he means no such thing . He only means-- "
181359	181374	181376	181376	she	2624	" He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two , "
181383	181406	181376	181376	she	2624	smile--"much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject . "
181407	181413	181193	181194	Mr. Knightley	97	" Emma , my dear Emma-- "
181414	181417	181418	181418	she	2624	" Oh ! "
181425	181519	181418	181418	she	2624	" if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion . Depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing _ you _ justice . He will think all the happiness , all the advantage , on your side of the question ; all the merit on mine . I wish I may not sink into ` poor Emma ' with him at once.-- His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther . "
181520	181523	181524	181524	he	2624	" Ah ! "
181527	181600	181524	181524	he	2624	" I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together . I am amused by one part of John 's letter-- did you notice it?--where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind . "
181601	181635	181418	181418	she	2624	" If I understand your brother , he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying . He had no idea of me . He seems perfectly unprepared for that . "
181636	181745	181524	181524	he	2624	" Yes , yes -- but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings . What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.-- But it was so , I suppose . I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day . I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual . I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` Uncle seems always tired now . ' "
182781	182797	182769	182769	he	450	saying--"Those matters will take care of themselves ; the young people will find a way . "
182997	183008	183010	183010	he	92	" It is to be a secret , I conclude , "
183012	183048	183010	183010	he	92	" These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them . Only let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion . "
183262	183273	183259	183259	he	100	" the young lady 's pride would now be contented ; "
183276	183288	183259	183259	he	100	" she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ; "
183303	183307	183259	183259	he	100	" Rather he than I!"--
183315	183472	183309	183310	Mrs. Elton	211	indeed.--"Poor Knightley ! poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was extremely concerned ; for , though very eccentric , he had a thousand good qualities.-- How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love-- not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him ! But that would be all over now.-- Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _ her _ . Oh ! no ; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every thing.--Extremely disagreeable ! But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan , living together . It would never do . She knew a family near Maple Grove who had tried it , and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter .
183557	183570	183542	183542	he	97	" I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news . "
183571	183576	183578	183578	she	128	" Good or bad ? "
183588	183600	183542	183542	he	97	" I do not know which it ought to be called . "
183601	183621	183542	183542	he	97	" Oh ! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance . You are trying not to smile . "
183622	183627	183629	183629	he	97	" I am afraid , "
183635	183656	183632	183632	his	97	" I am very much afraid , my dear Emma , that you will not smile when you hear it . "
183657	183683	183542	183542	he	97	" Indeed ! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too . "
183684	183690	183691	183691	he	97	" There is one subject , "
183694	183708	183691	183691	he	97	" I hope but one , on which we do not think alike . "
183725	183737	183709	183709	He	97	" Does nothing occur to you?-- Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith . "
183758	183768	183770	183770	he	97	" Have you heard from her yourself this morning ? "
183772	183784	183770	183770	he	97	" You have , I believe , and know the whole . "
183785	183800	183738	183738	Her	2656	" No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me . "
183801	183824	183770	183770	he	97	" You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is . Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin . "
183847	183854	183838	183838	her	128	" No , this is impossible ! "
183861	183868	183870	183871	Mr. Knightley	97	" It is so , indeed , "
183873	183891	183870	183871	Mr. Knightley	97	" I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left me not half an hour ago . "
183904	183963	183892	183892	She	128	" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were the same . But in time they will . Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject . "
183964	183974	183975	183975	she	128	" You mistake me , you quite mistake me , "
183981	184044	183979	183979	herself	128	" It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I can not believe it . It seems an impossibility!--You can not mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin . You can not mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet . You only mean , that he intends it . "
184045	184054	184056	184057	Mr. Knightley	97	" I mean that he has done it , "
184065	184070	184056	184057	Mr. Knightley	97	" and been accepted . "
184071	184075	184076	184076	she	128	" Good God ! "
184077	184113	184056	184057	Mr. Knightley	97	cried.--"Well!"--Then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , "
184162	184162	184076	184076	she	128	"
184163	184513	184514	184514	He	2657	" It is a very simple story . He went to town on business three days ago , and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John.--He delivered these papers to John , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley 's . They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley 's . The party was to be our brother and sister , Henry , John -- and Miss Smith . My friend Robert could not resist . They called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as I understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving . He came down by yesterday 's coach , and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast , to report his proceedings , first on my affairs , and then on his own . This is all that I can relate of the how , where , and when . Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.-- She will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman 's language can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only in the great.--However , I must say , that Robert Martin 's heart seemed for _ him _ , and to _ me _ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at Astley 's , my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John , and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy . "
184569	184700	184566	184566	he	2657	" Emma , my love , you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy ; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected . His situation is an evil -- but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend ; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more . His good sense and good principles would delight you.--As far as the man is concerned , you could not wish your friend in better hands . His rank in society I would alter if I could , which is saying a great deal I assure you , Emma.--You laugh at me about William Larkins ; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin . "
184727	184825	184701	184701	He	2658	" You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match . I think Harriet is doing extremely well . _ Her _ connexions may be worse than _ his _ . In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are . I have been silent from surprize merely , excessive surprize . You can not imagine how suddenly it has come on me ! how peculiarly unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before . "
184826	184835	184837	184838	Mr. Knightley	97	" You ought to know your friend best , "
184840	184876	184837	184838	Mr. Knightley	97	" but I should say she was a good - tempered , soft - hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her . "
184886	184991	184877	184877	Emma	128	" Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But , Mr. Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _ accepted _ him . I could suppose she might in time -- but can she already?-- Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him?--It was not Harriet 's hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox . "
185049	185064	185066	185066	she	128	" No , I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin , "
185087	185094	185096	185097	Mr. Knightley	97	" Do you dare say this ? "
185099	185126	185096	185097	Mr. Knightley	97	" Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of?-- What do you deserve ? "
185127	185178	185066	185066	she	128	" Oh ! I always deserve the best treatment , because I never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer . Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are ? "
185179	185185	185186	185186	he	97	" I am quite sure , "
185193	185312	185186	185186	he	97	" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so . He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do . He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends . Could I mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to Mrs. Goddard ? I assured him that I could not . Then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day . "
185313	185319	185321	185321	Emma	128	" I am perfectly satisfied , "
185328	185336	185321	185321	Emma	128	" and most sincerely wish them happy . "
185337	185350	185066	185066	she	128	" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before . "
185351	185365	185321	185321	Emma	128	" I hope so -- for at that time I was a fool . "
185366	185528	185066	185066	she	128	" And I am changed also ; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet 's good qualities . I have taken some pains for your sake , and for Robert Martin 's sake , ( whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever , ) to get acquainted with her . I have often talked to her a good deal . You must have seen that I did . Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin 's cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.-- Much of this , I have no doubt , she may thank you for . "
185529	185532	185534	185534	Emma	128	" Me ! "
185538	185543	185066	185066	she	128	head.--"Ah ! poor Harriet ! "
186039	186047	186049	186050	Mrs. Weston	169	" It is Frank and Miss Fairfax , "
186052	186097	186049	186050	Mrs. Weston	169	" I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning . He stays till to - morrow , and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us.--They are coming in , I hope . "
186250	186297	186241	186242	Frank Churchill	106	" I have to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs. Weston 's letters . I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon . I hope you do not retract what you then said . "
186298	186303	186305	186305	Emma	128	" No , indeed , "
186312	186338	186305	186305	Emma	128	" not in the least . I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you -- and to give you joy in person . "
186362	186369	186371	186371	he	91	" Is not she looking well ? "
186379	186398	186371	186371	he	91	" Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston doat upon her . "
186438	186446	186447	186447	she	128	" I can never think of it , "
186450	186455	186447	186447	she	128	" without extreme shame . "
186456	186460	186461	186461	he	91	" The shame , "
186464	186496	186461	186461	he	91	" is all mine , or ought to be . But is it possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late . Early , I know , you had none . "
186497	186508	186421	186421	he	91	" I never had the smallest , I assure you . "
186509	186576	186461	186461	he	91	" That appears quite wonderful . I was once very near -- and I wish I had-- it would have been better . But though I was always doing wrong things , they were very bad wrong things , and such as did me no service.-- It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing . "
186577	186586	186588	186588	Emma	128	" It is not now worth a regret , "
186590	186596	186598	186598	he	91	" I have some hope , "
186600	186687	186598	186598	he	91	" of my uncle 's being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her . When the Campbells are returned , we shall meet them in London , and continue there , I trust , till we may carry her northward.--But now , I am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard , Miss Woodhouse?-- Till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation . Do not you pity me ? "
186708	186715	186718	186718	his	2671	" Ah ! by the bye , "
186726	186733	186734	186734	He	2671	moment--"I hope Mr. Knightley is well ? "
186738	186787	186734	186734	He	2671	laughed.--"I know you saw my letter , and think you may remember my wish in your favour . Let me return your congratulations.-- I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He is a man whom I can not presume to praise . "
186827	186883	186822	186822	his	2671	" Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness ! such delicacy!-- and yet without being actually fair.--One can not call her fair . It is a most uncommon complexion , with her dark eye - lashes and hair-- a most distinguishing complexion ! So peculiarly the lady in it.-- Just colour enough for beauty . "
186884	186892	186894	186894	Emma	128	" I have always admired her complexion , "
186898	186928	186894	186894	Emma	128	" but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?-- When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten ? "
186929	186943	186945	186945	he	2671	" Oh ! no -- what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare-- "
186960	186998	186954	186954	Emma	128	" I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time , you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.-- I am sure it was a consolation to you . "
186999	187025	186894	186894	Emma	128	" Oh ! no , no , no -- how can you suspect me of such a thing ? I was the most miserable wretch ! "
187026	187100	186954	186954	Emma	128	" Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth . I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation . I think there is a little likeness between us . "
187104	187111	187112	187112	she	2673	" If not in our dispositions , "
187123	187150	187112	187112	she	2673	" there is a likeness in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own . "
187151	187156	187157	187157	he	2672	" True , true , "
187162	187277	187157	187157	he	2672	" No , not true on your side . You can have no superior , but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel . Look at her . Is not she an angel in every gesture ? Observe the turn of her throat . Observe her eyes , as she is looking up at my father.-- You will be glad to hear ( inclining his head , and whispering seriously ) that my uncle means to give her all my aunt 's jewels . They are to be new set . I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head . Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair ? "
187278	187284	187286	187286	Emma	128	" Very beautiful , indeed , "
187300	187342	187289	187289	she	128	" How delighted I am to see you again ! and to see you in such excellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world . I should certainly have called at Hartfield , had you failed to come . "
187472	187552	187447	187448	Mr. Woodhouse	91	" She should always send for Perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment . She could not be too soon alarmed , nor send for Perry too often . It was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it . "
187559	187562	187564	187564	he	106	" Perry ! "
187582	187611	187564	187564	he	106	" My friend Mr. Perry ! What are they saying about Mr. Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel now?--Has he set up his carriage ? "
187649	187657	187658	187658	he	106	" Such an extraordinary dream of mine ! "
187661	187754	187658	187658	he	106	" I can never think of it without laughing.--She hears us , she hears us , Miss Woodhouse . I see it in her cheek , her smile , her vain attempt to frown . Look at her . Do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye-- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ? "
187789	187815	187772	187772	she	157	" How you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me!-- They _ will _ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them ! "
189240	189262	189218	189219	Mrs. Elton	211	own.--"Very little white satin , very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard of it . "--But
