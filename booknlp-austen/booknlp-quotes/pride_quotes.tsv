Character	Quote
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But you forget , mamma , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He is also handsome , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can . His character is thereby complete . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Did not you ? _ I _ did for you . But that is one great difference between us . Compliments always take _ you _ by surprise , and _ me _ never . What could be more natural than his asking you again ? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . No thanks to his gallantry for that . Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . You have liked many a stupider person . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . You never see a fault in anybody . All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I know you do : and it is _ that _ which makes the wonder . With _ your _ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! Affectation of candour is common enough ; one meets with it everywhere . But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the good of everybody ’s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad,--belongs to you alone . And so , you like this man ’s sisters , too , do you ? Their manners are not equal to his . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ That is very true , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ and I could easily forgive _ his _ pride , if he had not mortified _ mine _ . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Your plan is a good one , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . But these are not Jane ’s feelings ; she is not acting by design . As yet she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness . She has known him only a fortnight . She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes : these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce , but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ What does Mr. Darcy mean , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But if he does it any more , I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ The entreaties of several ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Mr. Darcy is all politeness , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ That would be a good scheme , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I had much rather go in the coach . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But if you have got them to - day , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ my mother ’s purpose will be answered . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , I am not at all afraid of her dying . People do not die of little trifling colds . She will be taken good care of . As long as she stays there , it is all very well . I would go and see her if I could have the carriage . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am _ not _ a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Then , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Indeed , mamma , you are mistaken , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You quite mistook Mr. Darcy . He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And so ended his affection , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . Everything nourishes what is strong already . But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Your humility , Mr. Bingley , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ must disarm reproof . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You have only proved by this , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . You have shown him off now much more than he did himself . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ What you ask , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . You wanted me , I know , to say ‘ Yes , ’ that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . I have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all ; and now despise me if you dare . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Indeed I do not dare . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly grouped , and appear to uncommon advantage . The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth . Good - bye . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Not at all , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ but , depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ We can all plague and punish one another . Tease him -- laugh at him . Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _ me _ to have many such acquaintance . I dearly love a laugh . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Certainly , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ there are such people , but I hope I am not one of _ them _ . I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , _ do _ divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Perhaps that is not possible for anyone . But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Such as vanity and pride . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . But pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind -- pride will be always under good regulation . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect . He owns it himself without disguise . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ _ That _ is a failing , indeed ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Implacable resentment _ is _ a shade in a character . But you have chosen your fault well . I really can not _ laugh _ at it . You are safe from me . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And _ your _ defect is a propensity to hate everybody . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He must be an oddity , I think , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I can not make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ? We can not suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , my dear ; I think not . I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse . There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter which promises well . I am impatient to see him . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ About a month , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ As much as I ever wish to be , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Upon my word I say no more _ here _ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . Everybody is disgusted with his pride . You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I should take him , even on _ my _ slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I do not at all know ; but I _ heard _ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Good heavens ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ but how could _ that _ be ? How could his will be disregarded ? Why did not you seek legal redress ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly disgraced . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But what , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ A thorough , determined dislike of me -- a dislike which I can not but attribute in some measure to jealousy . Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father ’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him , I believe , very early in life . He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood -- the sort of preference which was often given me . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this -- though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him -- I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ To treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ A young man , too , like _ you _ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ How strange ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you . If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Lady Catherine de Bourgh , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ has very lately given him a living . I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , indeed , I did not . I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine ’s connections . I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Mr. Collins , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but , from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him ; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It is _ your _ turn to say something now , Mr. Darcy . _ I _ talked about the dance , and _ you _ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Very well ; that reply will do for the present . Perhaps , by - and - by , I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones ; but _ now _ we may be silent . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Do you talk by rule , then , while you are dancing ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Sometimes . One must speak a little , you know . It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together ; and yet , for the advantage of _ some _ , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Both , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the _ éclat _ of a proverb . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ His guilt and his descent appear , by your account , to be the same , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy ’s steward , and of _ that _ , I can assure you , he informed me himself . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Insolent girl ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I want to know , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham . But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person , in which case you may be sure of my pardon . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy . I am perfectly satisfied . But what does he say of the living ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley ’s sincerity , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . Mr. Bingley ’s defence of his friend was a very able one , I dare say ; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh dear ! Yes , certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy -- I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you upstairs . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Dear ma’am , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr. Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear . I am going away myself . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you will stay where you are . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Lizzy , I _ insist _ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Upon my word , sir , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make _ me _ happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _ you _ so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Really , Mr. Collins , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ you puzzle me exceedingly . If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I do assure you , sir , that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man . I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . My feelings in every respect forbid it . Can I speak plainer ? Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Come here , child , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I have sent for you on an affair of importance . I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage . Is it true ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	words:--“‘I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope , at some future period , to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known , and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . I depend on you for that . ’ ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It is unlucky , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . But may we not hope that the period of future happiness , to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . I will read it to you .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ ‘ When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days ; but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter : I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the crowd , but of that I despair . I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you . ’
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _ should _ . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You shall have it in a few words . Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You must decide for yourself , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you , by all means , to refuse him . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I can not consider your situation with much compassion . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It keeps him in good humour , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ and I am more obliged to you than I can express . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ undoubtedly ; ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My dear Jane , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ you are too good . Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to you . I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Nay , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ this is not fair . _ You _ wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody . _ I _ only want to think _ you _ perfect , and you set yourself against it . Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good - will . You need not . There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well . The more I see of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . I have met with two instances lately : one I will not mention , the other is Charlotte ’s marriage . It is unaccountable ! in every view it is unaccountable ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . They will ruin your happiness . You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . Consider Mr. Collins ’s respectability , and Charlotte ’s prudent , steady character . Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for everybody ’s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ To oblige you , I would try to believe almost anything , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart . My dear Jane , Mr. Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man : you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him can not have a proper way of thinking . You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger security for happiness . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And men take care that they should . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley ’s conduct to design , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ but , without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error and there may be misery . Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ’s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes ; to the last . But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . Stop me , whilst you can . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , in conjunction with his friend . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Your first position is false . They may wish many things besides his happiness : they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am sorry it went off . But these things happen so often ! A young man , such as you describe Mr. Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and , when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ An excellent consolation in its way , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ but it will not do for _ us _ . We do not suffer by accident . It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I never saw a more promising inclination ; he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance ; and I spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer . Could there be finer symptoms ? Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ As I did the other day , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _ that _ . But do not imagine that he is always here so often . It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . You know my mother ’s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now I hope you are satisfied . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Well , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ have it as you choose . _ He _ shall be mercenary , and _ she _ shall be foolish . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . I am sick of them all . Thank heaven ! I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him . Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My dear , dear aunt , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ what delight ! what felicity ! You give me fresh life and vigour . Adieu to disappointment and spleen . What are men to rocks and mountains ? Oh , what hours of transport we shall spend ! And when we _ do _ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of anything . We _ will _ know where we have gone -- we _ will _ recollect what we have seen . Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . Let _ our _ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ At the door ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And is this all ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind . Why does she not come in ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I like her appearance , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . She will make him a very proper wife . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Then who taught you ? who attended to you ? Without a governess , you must have been neglected . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Compared with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means . We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . Those who chose to be idle certainly might . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Ay , no doubt : but that is what a governess will prevent ; and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way . I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe ’s calling yesterday to thank me ? She finds Miss Pope a treasure . ‘ Lady Catherine , ’ said she , ‘ you have given me a treasure . ’ Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , ma’am , all . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ All ! What , all five out at once ? Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . Perhaps _ she _ is full young to be much in company . But really , ma’am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first . And to be kept back on _ such _ a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ With three younger sisters grown up , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ he never failed to inform them ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My eldest sister has been in town these three months . Have you never happened to see her there ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ At Church ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You mean to frighten me , Mr. Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me . But I will not be alarmed , though your sister _ does _ play so well . There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . Indeed , Mr. Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You shall hear , then -- but prepare for something very dreadful . The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ? He danced only four dances ! I am sorry to pain you , but so it was . He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . Mr. Darcy , you can not deny the fact . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball - room . Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? My fingers wait your orders . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My fingers , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women ’s do . They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because I would not take the trouble of practising . It is not that I do not believe _ my _ fingers as capable as any other woman ’s of superior execution . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr. Darcy ! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Perfectly so , I thank you . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . But , perhaps , Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I should never have considered the distance as one of the _ advantages _ of the match , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled _ near _ her family . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I did not know before that you ever walked this way . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , I should have turned in a moment . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes -- if Darcy does not put it off again . But I am at his disposal . He arranges the business just as he pleases . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ In my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either . Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Is this , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ meant for me ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And pray , what is the usual price of an earl ’s younger son ? Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . But , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present ; and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh yes , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am thinking of what you have been telling me , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Your cousin ’s conduct does not suit my feelings . Why was he to be the judge ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ’s inclination ; or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . But , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ To Jane herself , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ there could be no possibility of objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is ! Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . Neither could anything be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could _ feel _ gratitude , I would now thank you . But I cannot -- I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone . It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . The feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I might as well inquire , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ why , with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I _ was _ uncivil ? But I have other provocations . You know I have . Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _ there _ . You dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Can you deny that you have done it ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But it is not merely this affair , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ on which my dislike is founded . Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham . On this subject , what can you have to say ? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And of your infliction , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You have reduced him to his present state of poverty -- comparative poverty . You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him . You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert . You have done all this ! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You are mistaken , Mr. Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ From the very beginning , from the first moment , I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I have been walking in the grove some time , in the hope of meeting you . Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you . I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham . Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours , I can only say that I am sorry . The necessity must be obeyed , and further apology would be absurd . I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country . But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . I had often seen him in love before . At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas ’s accidental information , that Bingley ’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided . From that moment I observed my friend ’s behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard ; and I remained convinced , from the evening ’s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment . If _ you _ have not been mistaken here , _ I _ must have been in an error . Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain ; but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears . I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . But there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . These causes must be stated , though briefly . The situation of your mother ’s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend you . But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say , farther , that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . The part which I acted is now to be explained . His sisters ’ uneasiness had been equally excited with my own : our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went -- and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice . I described and enforced them earnestly . But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance , which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister ’s indifference . He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal , regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point . To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . I can not blame myself for having done thus much . There is but one part of my conduct , in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ’s being in town . I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley ; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence is , perhaps , probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . It is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . If I have wounded your sister ’s feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr. Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . Of what he has _ particularly _ accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ; and on George Wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ’s education . My father was not only fond of this young man ’s society , whose manners were always engaging , he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . The vicious propensities , the want of principle , which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr. Darcy could not have . Here again I shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell . But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character . It adds even another motive . My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant . There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . His own father did not long survive mine ; and within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . I rather wished than believed him to be sincere ; but , at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman . The business was therefore soon settled . He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . All connection between us seemed now dissolved . I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . In town , I believe , he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence ; and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father ’s intentions . You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it . His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself . After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropped . How he lived , I know not . But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ’s nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr. Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement . She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement ; and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . Regard for my sister ’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure ; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge . Mr. Wickham ’s chief object was unquestionably my sister ’s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement . His revenge would have been complete indeed . This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham . I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood , he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at , ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either . Detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . For the truth of everything here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who , from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ’s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . If your abhorrence of _ me _ should make _ my _ assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . I will only add , God bless you .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ FITZWILLIAM DARCY . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ This must be false ! This can not be ! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and
Elizabeth Bennet	“ How despicably have I acted ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I , who have prided myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust . How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind . But vanity , not love , has been my folly . Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away where either were concerned . Till this moment , I never knew myself . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But my father can not . He wrote last week to hurry my return . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You are all kindness , madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And how much I shall have to conceal ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Are they , indeed ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ _ that _ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . Good Heaven ! Brighton and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And Mary King is safe ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ His being so sure of succeeding was wrong , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Indeed , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Blame you ! Oh , no . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No -- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But you _ will _ know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ This will not do , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ you never will be able to make both of them good for anything . Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy ’s , but you shall do as you choose . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . What is your own opinion ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You are quite right . To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . He is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character . We must not make him desperate . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And then , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . The liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If you were aware , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia ’s unguarded and imprudent manner , nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , no ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement ; but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But it is fortunate , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ that I have something to wish for . Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister ’s absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized . A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But surely , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars , without his perceiving me . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And of this place , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I might have been mistress ! With these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted ! Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But , no , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; I should not have been allowed to invite them . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ A little . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , very handsome . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Except , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ when she goes to Ramsgate . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , sir ; but I do not know when _ that _ will be . I do not know who is good enough for him . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , sir , I know I am . If I were to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . But I have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous - hearted boy in the world . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Can this be Mr. Darcy ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , ma’am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He is the best landlord , and the best master , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ that ever lived . Not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves . There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw anything of it . To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ In what an amiable light does this place him ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He is certainly a good brother , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ delightful , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ charming , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ What will be his surprise , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ when he knows who they are ! He takes them now for people of fashion . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Why is he so altered ? From what can it proceed ? It can not be for _ me _ , it can not be for _ my _ sake that his manners are thus softened . My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . It is impossible that he should still love me . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that can not be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , I thank you , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ There is nothing the matter with me . I am quite well , I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . It can not be concealed from anyone . My youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped ; has thrown herself into the power of -- of Mr. Wickham . They are gone off together from Brighton . _ You _ know him too well to doubt the rest . She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ When I consider , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ that _ I _ might have prevented it ! _ I _ who knew what he was . Had I but explained some part of it only -- some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! Had his character been known , this could not have happened . But it is all , all too late now . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond : they are certainly not gone to Scotland . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My father has gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle ’s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . How is such a man to be worked on ? How are they even to be discovered ? I have not the smallest hope . It is every way horrible ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Do you really think so ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It does seem , and it is most shocking , indeed , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ that a sister ’s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . But , really , I know not what to say . Perhaps I am not doing her justice . But she is very young : she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . She has been doing everything in her power , by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I do , indeed , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless . From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . Yet he knew to the contrary himself . He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But does Lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , yes!--that , that is the worst of all . Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . And when I returned home the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight ’s time . As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone , that the good opinion , which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . That _ she _ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . That such a consequence as _ this _ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Not the slightest . I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away . When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months : but he never distinguished _ her _ by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Is my father in town ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And have you heard from him often ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And my mother -- how is she ? How are you all ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But you -- how are you ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You look pale . How much you must have gone through ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment ! But at least it shows that _ she _ was serious in the object of her journey . Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _ scheme _ of infamy . My poor father ! how he must have felt it ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , Jane , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ She had better have stayed at home , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one ’s neighbours . Assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable . Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My dear Sir , * /
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . Be assured , my dear sir , that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be , of all others , most afflicting to a parent ’s mind . The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others : for who , as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ? And this consideration leads me , moreover , to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last November ; for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . Let me advise you , then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am , dear sir , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You must not be too severe upon yourself , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You may well warn me against such an evil . Human nature is so prone to fall into it ! No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . It will pass away soon enough . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I have seen them both . They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . These are conditions which , considering everything , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr. Wickham ’s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care . Send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly . We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . She comes to us to - day . I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on . Yours , etc .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ EDW . GARDINER . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Is it possible ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Can it be possible that he will marry her ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And have you answered the letter ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No ; but it must be done soon . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh ! my dear father , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ come back and write immediately . Consider how important every moment is in such a case . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And -- may I ask ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And they _ must _ marry ! Yet he is _ such _ a man . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ That is very true , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ though it had not occurred to me before . His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! Oh , it must be my uncle ’s doings ! Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . A small sum could not do all this . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And they are really to be married ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ How strange this is ! and for _ this _ we are to be thankful . That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! Oh , Lydia ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If we are ever able to learn what Wickham ’s debts have been , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own . The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge . By this time she is actually with them ! If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Their conduct has been such , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ as neither you , nor I , nor anybody , can ever forget . It is useless to talk of it . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I thank you for my share of the favour , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Lizzy , I never gave _ you _ an account of my wedding , I believe . You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ No , really , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I think there can not be too little said on the subject . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ La ! You are so strange ! But I must tell you how it went off . We were married , you know , at St. Clement ’s , because Wickham ’s lodgings were in that parish . And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o’clock . My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss ! I was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual : I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . If you ’ll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . Not one party , or scheme , or anything ! To be sure , London was rather thin , but , however , the Little Theatre was open .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Well , and so , just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone . And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day . But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes ’ time , and then we all set out . However , I recollected afterwards , that if he _ had _ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr. Darcy might have done as well . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Mr. Darcy ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , yes ! he was to come there with Wickham , you know . But , gracious me ! I quite forgot ! I ought not to have said a word about it . I promised them so faithfully ! What will Wickham say ? It was to be such a secret ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , certainly , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ we will ask you no questions . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You may readily comprehend , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and , comparatively speaking , a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . Pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Not that I _ shall _ , though , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ and , my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You certainly do , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ True . Are the others coming out ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It must be something particular to take him there at this time of year . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Very much . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I do not recollect that we did . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ How should you have liked making sermons ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I _ have _ heard from authority , which I thought _ as good _ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I _ did _ hear , too , that there was a time when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ This is the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yet it is hard , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ that this poor man can not come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! I _ will _ leave him to himself . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I wish I could say anything to comfort you , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ but it is wholly out of my power . You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Could I expect it to be otherwise ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yet why did he come ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ The first wish of my heart , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ is never more to be in company with either of them . Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! Let me never see either one or the other again ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ did he come at all ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He could be still amiable , still pleasing to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? If he fears me , why come hither ? If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? Teasing , teasing man ! I will think no more about him . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , very indifferent , indeed , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , Jane ! take care . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If he does not come to me , _ then _ , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I shall give him up for ever . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ A man who has once been refused ! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? Is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Is your sister at Pemberley still ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes ; she will remain there till Christmas . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And quite alone ? Have all her friends left her ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Mrs. Annesley is with her . The others have been gone on to Scarborough these three weeks . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Well , girls , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ what say you to the day ? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . The venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch . The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases ’ last week ; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least . And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . Mrs. Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . And what do you think she said besides ? ‘ Ah ! Mrs. Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last ! ’ She did , indeed . I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Lizzy , you must not do so . You must not suspect me . It mortifies me . I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it . I am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! And how impossible in others ! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Nothing , child , nothing . I did not wink at you . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ ’ Tis too much ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ by far too much . I do not deserve it . Oh , why is not everybody as happy ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I must go instantly to my mother , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude , or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself . He is gone to my father already . Oh , Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall I bear so much happiness ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And this , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ is the end of all his friend ’s anxious circumspection ! of all his sister ’s falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , and most reasonable end ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I suspected as much , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ That is the most unforgiving speech , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ that I ever heard you utter . Good girl ! It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley ’s pretended regard . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ He made a little mistake , to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ How could I ever think her like her nephew ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If you believed it impossible to be true , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . What could your Ladyship propose by it ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ will be rather a confirmation of it -- if , indeed , such a report is in existence . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I never heard that it was . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship . _ You _ may ask questions which _ I _ shall not choose to answer . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But you are not entitled to know _ mine _ ; nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Only this,--that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ These are heavy misfortunes , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Whatever my connections may be , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _ you _ . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ has any possible claim on me , in the present instance . No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy . And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _ were _ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ’s concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I shall know how to understand it . I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ From Mr. Collins ! and what can _ he _ have to say ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Are you not diverted ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , yes . Pray read on . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ ‘ After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that , on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . ’ Mr. Collins , moreover , adds , ‘ I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia ’s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known . I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . You ought certainly to forgive them as a Christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . ’ _ That _ is his notion of Christian forgiveness ! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte ’s situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch . But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . You are not going to be _ missish _ , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am exceedingly diverted . But it is so strange ! ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , _ that _ is what makes it amusing . Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference and _ your _ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd ! Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr. Collins ’s correspondence for any consideration . Nay , when I read a letter of his , I can not help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law . And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? Did she call to refuse her consent ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Yes , you know enough of my _ frankness _ to believe me capable of _ that _ . After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then we have both , I hope , improved in civility . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , do not repeat what I then said . These recollections will not do at all . I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I must ask whether you were surprised ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Not at all . When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Did you speak from your own observation , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You are joking , Lizzy . This can not be ! Engaged to Mr. Darcy ! No , no , you shall not deceive me : I know it to be impossible . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ This is a wretched beginning , indeed ! My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . I speak nothing but the truth . He still loves me , and we are engaged . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You know nothing of the matter . _ That _ is all to be forgot . Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now ; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable . This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ There can be no doubt of that . It is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . But are you pleased , Jane ? Shall you like to have such a brother ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Oh , yes ! You will only think I feel _ more _ than I ought to do when I tell you all . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley . I am afraid you will be angry . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began ; but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Have you any other objection , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ than your belief of my indifference ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I do , I do like him , ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I love him . Indeed he has no improper pride . He is perfectly amiable . You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! And so , Darcy did everything ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ’s debts , and got him his commission ! So much the better . It will save me a world of trouble and economy . Had it been your uncle ’s doing , I must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way . I shall offer to pay him to - morrow , he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Good gracious ! Lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! Mr. Darcy ! Who would have thought it ? And is it really true ? Oh , my sweetest Lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! What pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! Jane ’s is nothing to it -- nothing at all . I am so pleased -- so happy . Such a charming man ! so handsome ! so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before . I hope he will overlook it . Dear , dear Lizzy . A house in town ! Everything that is charming ! Three daughters married ! Ten thousand a year ! Oh , Lord ! what will become of me ? I shall go distracted . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ How could you begin ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I can not fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . It is too long ago . I was in the middle before I knew that I _ had _ begun . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to _ you _ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . Now , be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ For the liveliness of your mind I did . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You may as well call it impertinence at once . It was very little less . The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for _ your _ approbation alone . I roused and interested you , because I was so unlike _ them _ . Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it : but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . There -- I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . To be sure you know no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of _ that _ when they fall in love . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Dearest Jane ! who could have done less for her ? But make a virtue of it by all means . My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly , by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last ? What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ But I was embarrassed . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And so was I. ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ A man who had felt less might . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! But I wonder how long you _ would _ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . I wonder when you _ would _ have spoken if I had not asked you ! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . _ Too much _ , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? This will never do . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ You need not distress yourself . The moral will be perfectly fair . Lady Catherine ’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . I was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours . My aunt ’s intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know everything . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequences ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ My real purpose was to see _ you _ , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me . My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her ? ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . But it ought to be done ; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . ”
Elizabeth Bennet	“ I wish you joy . If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . It is a great comfort to have you so rich ; and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much ; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . Any place would do of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it , if you had rather not .
Elizabeth Bennet	“ Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Come , Darcy , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I must have you dance . I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . You had much better dance . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ _ You _ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ She is tolerable ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Which do you mean ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ She is tolerable : but not handsome enough to tempt _ me _ ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself , for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr. Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You can not refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I have been used to consider poetry as the _ food _ of love , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Nothing is more deceitful , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ than the appearance of humility . It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ The indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which , if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . The power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance . When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning , that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself ; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I daresay you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , ‘ Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ’ you would probably do it -- you would probably not go -- and , at another word , might stay a month . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Upon my word , I can not exactly explain the matter -- Darcy must speak for himself . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ To yield readily -- easily -- to the _ persuasion _ of a friend is no merit with you . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You appear to me , Mr. Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley . We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . But in general and ordinary cases , between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Perhaps I do . Arguments are too much like disputes . If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Do you not feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ This walk is not wide enough for our party . We had better go into the avenue . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ very glad ; ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ’s confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking : if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ No , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I have made no such pretension . I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . My temper I dare not vouch for . It is , I believe , too little yielding ; certainly too little for the convenience of the world . I can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them . My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his _ making _ friends ; whether he may be equally capable of _ retaining _ them , is less certain . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ For heaven ’s sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I assure you , madam , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ that she does not need such advice . She practises very constantly . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ So much the better . It can not be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice . I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson ’s room . She would be in nobody ’s way , you know , in that part of the house . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I shall not say that you are mistaken , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which , in fact , are not your own . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Perhaps , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I should have judged better had I sought an introduction , but I am ill - qualified to recommend myself to strangers . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . I can not catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You are perfectly right . You have employed your time much better . No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting . We neither of us perform to strangers . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I should not be surprised , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ This seems a very comfortable house . Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I believe she did -- and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . My friend has an excellent understanding -- though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . She seems perfectly happy , however ; and , in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ An easy distance do you call it ? It is nearly fifty miles . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ And what is fifty miles of good road ? Little more than half a day ’s journey . Yes , I call it a very easy distance . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ _ You _ can not have a right to such very strong local attachment . _ You _ can not have been always at Longbourn . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Are you pleased with Kent ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ He did not talk to me of his own arts , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ He only told me what I have now told you . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ That is not an unnatural surmise , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ’s triumph very sadly . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ In vain have I struggled . It will not do . My feelings will not be repressed . You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _ endeavour _ at civility , I am thus rejected . But it is of small importance . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . Towards _ him _ I have been kinder than towards myself . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ You take an eager interest in that gentleman ’s concerns , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ His misfortunes ! ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	contemptuously,--“yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ And this , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ is your opinion of me ! This is the estimation in which you hold me ! I thank you for explaining it so fully . My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! But , perhaps , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I , with greater policy , concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by everything . But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . They were natural and just . Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Yes , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ but _ that _ was only when I first knew her ; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Let me call your maid . Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I am grieved , indeed , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ grieved -- shocked . But is it certain , absolutely certain ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ When _ my _ eyes were opened to his real character , oh ! had I known what I ought , what I dared to do ! But I knew not -- I was afraid of doing too much . Wretched , wretched mistake ! ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Gracechurch Street , _ Sept. 6 _ . * /
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ My dear Niece ,
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a _ little _ writing will not comprise what I have to tell you . I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from _ you _ . Do n’t think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _ your _ side . If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . Your uncle is as much surprised as I am ; and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done . But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . Mr. Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _ yours _ seems to have been . He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both -- Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham ’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him . He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world . His character was to speak for itself . He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself . If he _ had another _ motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . He had been some days in town before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs. Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . She then took a large house in Edward Street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . This Mrs. Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . Wickham , indeed , had gone to her on their first arrival in London ; and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction . They were in ---- Street . He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia . His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance as far as it would go . But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . She cared for none of her friends ; she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving Wickham . She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt had never been _ his _ design . He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of Lydia ’s flight on her own folly alone . He meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once . Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . Wickham , of course , wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . Everything being settled between _ them _ , Mr. Darcy ’s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch Street the evening before I came home . But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen ; and Mr. Darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former . He did not leave his name , and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . On Saturday he came again . Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . They met again on Sunday , and then _ I _ saw him too . It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . But our visitor was very obstinate . I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all . He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but _ this _ is the true one . Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . But , Lizzy , this must go no further than yourself , or Jane at most . You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _ her _ , and his commission purchased . The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . It was owing to him , to his reserve and want of proper consideration , that Wickham ’s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . Perhaps there was some truth in _ this _ ; though I doubt whether _ his _ reserve , or _ anybody ’s _ reserve can be answerable for the event . But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _ another interest _ in the affair . When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . I believe I have now told you everything . It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . Lydia came to us , and Wickham had constant admission to the house . _ He _ was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _ her _ behaviour while she stayed with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane ’s letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain . I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . I was sometimes quite provoked ; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return , and , as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him ? His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _ that _ , if he marry _ prudently _ , his wife may teach him . I thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . But slyness seems the fashion . Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . A low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing . But I must write no more . The children have been wanting me this half hour .
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Yours , very sincerely ,
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ M. GARDINER . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I began to be afraid you would never come back again . People _ did _ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away . Miss Lucas is married and settled : and one of my own daughters . I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . It was in the ‘ Times ’ and the ‘ Courier , ’ I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . It was only said , ‘ Lately , George Wickham , Esq . , to Miss Lydia Bennet , ’ without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything . It was my brother Gardiner ’s drawing up , too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . Did you see it ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ If you _ will _ thank me , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ let it be for yourself alone . That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . But your _ family _ owe me nothing . Much as I respect them , I believe I thought only of _ you _ . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Did it , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I knew , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . I hope you have destroyed the letter . There was one part , especially the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ When I wrote that letter , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I believed myself perfectly calm and cool ; but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . The adieu is charity itself . But think no more of the letter . The feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten . You must learn some of my philosophy . Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . _ Your _ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of ignorance . But with _ me _ , it is not so . Painful recollections will intrude , which can not , which ought not to be repelled . I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . As a child I was taught what was _ right _ , but I was not taught to correct my temper . I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . Unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only _ child _ ) , I was spoiled by my parents , who , though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _ wish _ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . Such I was , from eight to eight - and - twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth ! What do I not owe you ! You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . By you , I was properly humbled . I came to you without a doubt of my reception . You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Indeed I had . What will you think of my vanity ? I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , I assure you . I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . How you must have hated me after _ that _ evening ! ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Hate you ! I was angry , perhaps , at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley . You blamed me for coming ? ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ No , indeed , I felt nothing but surprise . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Your surprise could not be greater than _ mine _ in being noticed by you . My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive _ more _ than my due . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ My object _ then _ , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ was to show you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . How soon any other wishes introduced themselves , I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ That is to say , you had given your permission . I guessed as much . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ On the evening before my going to London , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent . His surprise was great . He had never had the slightest suspicion . I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Well , my dear , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I have no more to say . If this be the case , he deserves you . I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to anyone less worthy . ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write . You supposed more than really existed . But _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err . You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . I thank you again and again , for not going to the Lakes . How could I be so silly as to wish it ! Your idea of the ponies is delightful . We will go round the park every day . I am the happiest creature in the world . Perhaps other people have said so before , but no one with such justice . I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me . You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . Yours , ”
Fitzwilliam Darcy	“ Dear Sir , * /
Jane Bennet	“ He is just what a young - man ought to be , ”
Jane Bennet	“ sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! ”
Jane Bennet	“ I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . I did not expect such a compliment . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Dear Lizzy ! ”
Jane Bennet	“ I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone ; but I always speak what I think . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Certainly not , at first ; but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . Miss Bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Are you quite sure , ma’am ? Is not there a little mistake ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Miss Bingley told me , ”
Jane Bennet	“ that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . With _ them _ he is remarkably agreeable . ”
Jane Bennet	“ But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . If _ I _ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . ”
Jane Bennet	“ But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavor to conceal it , he must find it out . ”
Jane Bennet	“ It is from Miss Bingley , ”
Jane Bennet	“ Can I have the carriage ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ Though it is difficult , ”
Jane Bennet	“ to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . ”
Jane Bennet	“ As to her _ younger _ daughters , she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not _ know _ of any prepossession;--her _ eldest _ daughter she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . ”
Jane Bennet	“ They have both , ”
Jane Bennet	“ been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear _ them _ , too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Laugh as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy , to be treating his father ’s favourite in such a manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? Oh no . ”
Jane Bennet	“ I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley ’s being imposed on than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr. Darcy contradict it . Besides , there was truth in his looks . ”
Jane Bennet	“ It is difficult , indeed -- it is distressing . One does not know what to think . ”
Jane Bennet	“ I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think . ”
Jane Bennet	“ No , ”
Jane Bennet	“ I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour , of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account , as well as his sister ’s , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy ’s regard . ”
Jane Bennet	“ No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . ”
Jane Bennet	“ He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _ conditionally _ only . ”
Jane Bennet	“ This is from Caroline Bingley : what it contains has surprised me a good deal . The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . You shall hear what she says . ”
Jane Bennet	“ It is evident by this , ”
Jane Bennet	“ that he comes back no more this winter . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Why will you think so ? It must be his own doing ; he is his own master . But you do not know _ all _ . I _ will _ read you the passage which particularly hurts me . I will have no reserves from _ you _ . ‘ Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister ; and to confess the truth , _ we _ are scarcely less eager to meet her again . I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . My brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister ’s partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman ’s heart . With all these circumstances to favour an attachment , and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? ’ What think you of _ this _ sentence , my dear Lizzy ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ Is it not clear enough ? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ’s indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard . Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ Most willingly . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection ; Miss Bingley , I am sure , can not : she is not such a simpleton . Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . But the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _ one _ inter - marriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that , because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday ; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . ”
Jane Bennet	“ If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , ”
Jane Bennet	“ your representation of all this might make me quite easy . But I know the foundation is unjust . Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . ”
Jane Bennet	“ That is right . You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine : believe her to be deceived , by all means . You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . ”
Jane Bennet	“ But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ How can you talk so ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ you must know , that , though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . ”
Jane Bennet	“ But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . A thousand things may arise in six months . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Indeed , Mr. Bennet , ”
Jane Bennet	“ it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that _ I _ should be forced to make way for _ her _ , and live to see her take my place in it ! ”
Jane Bennet	“ My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . Let us hope for better things . Let us flatter ourselves that _ I _ may be the survivor . ”
Jane Bennet	“ I can not bear to think that they should have all this estate . If it was not for the entail , I should not mind it . ”
Jane Bennet	“ What should not you mind ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ I should not mind anything at all . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . ”
Jane Bennet	“ I never can be thankful , Mr. Bennet , for anything about the entail . How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ’s own daughters I can not understand ; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins , too ! Why should _ he _ have it more than anybody else ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ You doubt me , ”
Jane Bennet	“ indeed , you have no reason . He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all . I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . Thank God I have not _ that _ pain . A little time , therefore -- I shall certainly try to get the better---- ”
Jane Bennet	“ I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself . ”
Jane Bennet	“ I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , ”
Jane Bennet	“ and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . But enough of this . You alluded to something else . You mentioned _ two _ instances . I can not misunderstand you , but I entreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _ that person _ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect . It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us . Women fancy admiration means more than it does . ”
Jane Bennet	“ If it is designedly done , they can not be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . ”
Jane Bennet	“ And do you impute it to either of those ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ I can not believe it . Why should they try to influence him ? They can only wish his happiness ; and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy , ”
Jane Bennet	“ but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ’s . What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . By supposing such an affection , you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy . Do not distress me by the idea . I am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . ”
Jane Bennet	“ My aunt , ”
Jane Bennet	“ is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street . ”
Jane Bennet	“ I did not think Caroline in spirits , ”
Jane Bennet	“ but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . I inquired after their brother , of course . He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him . I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner : I wish I could see her . My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out . I dare say I shall soon see them here . ”
Jane Bennet	“ My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley ’s regard for me . But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but , if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the meantime . When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was , in every respect , so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . I pity , though I can not help blaming , her . She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable . I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . I can not understand it . If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . Let me hear from you very soon . Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . We had better not mention it . I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . I am sure you will be very comfortable there .
Jane Bennet	“ But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , ”
Jane Bennet	“ I do not know when I have been more shocked , ”
Jane Bennet	“ Wickham so very bad ! It is almost past belief . And poor Mr. Darcy ! dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . Such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! It is really too distressing , I am sure you must feel it so . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Oh no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . Your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Poor Wickham ! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his manner . ”
Jane Bennet	“ There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men . One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . ”
Jane Bennet	“ I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _ appearance _ of it as you used to do . ”
Jane Bennet	“ And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . It is such a spur to one ’s genius , such an opening for wit , to have a dislike of that kind . One may be continually abusive without saying anything just ; but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Indeed , I could not . I was uncomfortable enough , I was very uncomfortable -- I may say unhappy . And with no one to speak to of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me , and say that I had not been so very weak , and vain , and nonsensical , as I knew I had ! Oh , how I wanted you ! ”
Jane Bennet	“ How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy , for now they _ do _ appear wholly undeserved . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Certainly . But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . There is one point on which I want your advice . I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham ’s character . ”
Jane Bennet	“ That it ought not to be attempted . Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public . On the contrary , every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . I am not equal to it . Wickham will soon be gone ; and , therefore , it will not signify to anybody here what he really is . Some time hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . At present I will say nothing about it . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Not yet , ”
Jane Bennet	“ But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope everything will be well . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Yes , he went on Tuesday , as I wrote you word . ”
Jane Bennet	“ We have heard only once . He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . ”
Jane Bennet	“ My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . She is upstairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . She does not yet leave her dressing - room . Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! are quite well . ”
Jane Bennet	“ He meant , I believe , ”
Jane Bennet	“ to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if anything could be made out from them . His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ’s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked , he meant to make inquiries at Clapham . If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make inquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . I do not know of any other designs that he had formed ; but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . ”
Jane Bennet	“ A gamester ! ”
Jane Bennet	“ This is wholly unexpected ; I had not an idea of it . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Then it is as I always hoped , ”
Jane Bennet	“ they are married ! ”
Jane Bennet	“ Let me write for you , ”
Jane Bennet	“ if you dislike the trouble yourself . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Complied with ! I am only ashamed of his asking so little . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Yes , yes , they must marry . There is nothing else to be done . But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Money ! my uncle ! ”
Jane Bennet	“ what do you mean , sir ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . ”
Jane Bennet	“ I comfort myself with thinking , ”
Jane Bennet	“ that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced . He has children of his own , and may have more . How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , ”
Jane Bennet	“ I hope and trust they will yet be happy . His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . ”
Jane Bennet	“ My dear , dear Lydia ! ”
Jane Bennet	“ this is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be -- I knew he would manage everything . How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too ! But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . Stay , stay , I will go myself . Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill . I will put on my things in a moment . My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! ”
Jane Bennet	“ I will go to Meryton , ”
Jane Bennet	“ as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long . Kitty , run down and order the carriage . An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . Girls , can I do anything for you in Meryton ? Oh ! here comes Hill . My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding . ”
Jane Bennet	“ If it was to be a secret , ”
Jane Bennet	“ say not another word on the subject . You may depend upon my seeking no further . ”
Jane Bennet	“ I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , ”
Jane Bennet	“ It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference ; but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much I suffer from what she says . Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over ! ”
Jane Bennet	“ Good gracious ! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does , I vow . Well , any friend of Mr. Bingley ’s will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Let me first see how he behaves , ”
Jane Bennet	“ it will then be early enough for expectation . ”
Jane Bennet	“ We will be down as soon as we can , ”
Jane Bennet	“ but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went upstairs half an hour ago . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Oh ! hang Kitty ! what has she to do with it ? Come , be quick , be quick ! where is your sash , my dear ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ He has made me so happy , ”
Jane Bennet	“ by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! I had not believed it possible . ”
Jane Bennet	“ But how did he account for it ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ It must have been his sisters ’ doing . They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I can not wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again : though we can never be what we once were to each other . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! ”
Jane Bennet	“ Oh , Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ? If I could but see you as happy ! If there were but such another man for you ! ”
Jane Bennet	“ Oh , Lizzy ! it can not be . I know how much you dislike him . ”
Jane Bennet	“ Good heaven ! can it be really so ? Yet now I must believe you , ”
Jane Bennet	“ My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ Very , very much . Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . And do you really love him quite well enough ? Oh , Lizzy ! do anything rather than marry without affection . Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ What do you mean ? ”
Jane Bennet	“ My dearest sister , now be , _ be _ serious . I want to talk very seriously . Let me know everything that I am to know without delay . Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? ”
William Collins	“ Protested that he never read novels ”
William Collins	“ I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . It amazes me , I confess ; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . But I will no longer importune my young cousin . ”
William Collins	“ I know very well , madam , ”
William Collins	“ that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . There are , undoubtedly , many who could not say the same ; but , thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . ”
William Collins	“ You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy . ”
William Collins	“ I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , ”
William Collins	“ that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially ; a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . ”
William Collins	“ I have found out , ”
William Collins	“ by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness . I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh , and of her mother , Lady Catherine . How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! Who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . ”
William Collins	“ Indeed I am . I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . I believe him to be Lady Catherine ’s _ nephew _ . It will be in my power to assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight . ”
William Collins	“ I have no reason , I assure you , ”
William Collins	“ to be dissatisfied with my reception . Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine ’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . It was really a very handsome thought . Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . ”
William Collins	“ If I , ”
William Collins	“ were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible . And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . I can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family . ”
William Collins	“ to assure you in the most animated language ”
William Collins	“ May I hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? ”
William Collins	“ Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _ not _ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother ’s permission for this address . You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . ”
William Collins	“ My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and , thirdly , which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss De Bourgh ’s footstool,--that she said , ‘ Mr. Collins , you must marry . A clergyman like you must marry . Choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for _ my _ sake , and for your _ own _ ; let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . This is my advice . Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ’ Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , I think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father ( who , however , may live many years longer ) , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents . , which will not be yours till after your mother ’s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent : and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . ”
William Collins	“ I am not now to learn , ”
William Collins	“ that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . I am , therefore , by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . ”
William Collins	“ Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , ”
William Collins	gravely--“but I can not imagine that her Ladyship would at all disapprove of you . And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . ”
William Collins	“ When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and , perhaps , you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . ”
William Collins	“ You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course . My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into further consideration that , in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . Your portion is unhappily so small , that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . As I must , therefore , conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . ”
William Collins	“ Pardon me for interrupting you , madam , ”
William Collins	“ but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . If , therefore , she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because , if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . ”
William Collins	“ My dear madam , ”
William Collins	“ let us be for ever silent on this point . Far be it from me , ”
William Collins	“ to resent the behaviour of your daughter . Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all : the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been , in early preferment ; and , I trust , I am resigned . Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed , that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ’s favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter ’s lips instead of your own ; but we are all liable to error . I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family ; and if my _ manner _ has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologize . ”
William Collins	“ My dear madam , ”
William Collins	“ this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . ”
William Collins	“ My dear sir , ”
William Collins	“ I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her Ladyship ’s concurrence . ”
William Collins	“ Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . Her Ladyship ’s carriage is regularly ordered for us . I _ should _ say , one of her Ladyship ’s carriages , for she has several . ”
William Collins	“ Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . She is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference . ”
William Collins	“ Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter . I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest -- there is no occasion for anything more . Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . ”
William Collins	“ I know not , Miss Elizabeth , ”
William Collins	“ whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us ; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly . ”
William Collins	“ It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome . Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine ’s family is , indeed , the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . You see on what a footing we are . You see how continually we are engaged there . In truth , I must acknowledge , that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . ”
William Collins	“ But , ”
William Collins	“ you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . ”
William Collins	“ My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? ”
George Wickham	“ I know little of the game at present , ”
George Wickham	“ but I shall be glad to improve myself ; for in my situation of life---- ”
George Wickham	“ Yes , ”
George Wickham	“ his estate there is a noble one . A clear ten thousand per annum . You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself -- for I have been connected with his family , in a particular manner , from my infancy . ”
George Wickham	“ I have no right to give _ my _ opinion , ”
George Wickham	“ as to his being agreeable or otherwise . I am not qualified to form one . I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . It is impossible for _ me _ to be impartial . But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish -- and , perhaps , you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . ”
George Wickham	“ I can not pretend to be sorry , ”
George Wickham	“ that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _ him _ I believe it does not often happen . The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chooses to be seen . ”
George Wickham	“ I wonder , ”
George Wickham	“ whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . ”
George Wickham	“ Oh no -- it is not for _ me _ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy . If _ he _ wishes to avoid seeing _ me _ he must go . We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding _ him _ but what I might proclaim to all the world -- a sense of very great ill - usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr. Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . ”
George Wickham	“ It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , ”
George Wickham	“ which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire . I know it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps ; and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . Society , I own , is necessary to me . I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . I _ must _ have employment and society . A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . The church _ ought _ to have been my profession -- I was brought up for the church ; and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . ”
George Wickham	“ Indeed ! ”
George Wickham	“ Yes -- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift . He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . I can not do justice to his kindness . He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . ”
George Wickham	“ There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law . A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short , anything or nothing . Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it . I have a warm unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _ of _ him , and _ to _ him , too freely . I can recall nothing worse . But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . ”
George Wickham	“ Some time or other he _ will _ be -- but it shall not be by _ me _ . Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose _ him _ . ”
George Wickham	“ I will not trust myself on the subject , ”
George Wickham	“ _ I _ can hardly be just to him . ”
George Wickham	“ We were born in the same parish , within the same park ; the greatest part of our youth was passed together : inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care . _ My _ father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr. Philips , appears to do so much credit to ; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend . Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ’s active superintendence ; and when , immediately before my father ’s death , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _ him _ as of affection to myself . ”
George Wickham	“ It _ is _ wonderful , ”
George Wickham	“ for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride . ”
George Wickham	“ Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good ? ”
George Wickham	“ Yes ; it has often led him to be liberal and generous ; to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . Family pride , and _ filial _ pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . He has also _ brotherly _ pride , which , with _ some _ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . ”
George Wickham	“ What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? ”
George Wickham	“ I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley . How can Mr. Bingley , who seems good - humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr. Bingley ? ”
George Wickham	“ He is a sweet - tempered , amiable , charming man . He can not know what Mr. Darcy is . ”
George Wickham	“ I believe her to be both in a great degree , ”
George Wickham	“ I have not seen her for many years ; but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . ”
George Wickham	“ I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . ”
George Wickham	“ How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? ”
George Wickham	“ Nearly three weeks . ”
George Wickham	“ And you saw him frequently ? ”
George Wickham	“ Yes , almost every day . ”
George Wickham	“ His manners are very different from his cousin ’s . ”
George Wickham	“ Yes , very different ; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance . ”
George Wickham	“ Indeed ! ”
George Wickham	“ And pray may I ask-- ”
George Wickham	“ Is it in address that he improves ? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style ? for I dare not hope , ”
George Wickham	“ that he is improved in essentials . ”
George Wickham	“ You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right . His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by . I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . His fear of her has always operated , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . ”
George Wickham	“ I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? ”
George Wickham	“ I should be sorry , indeed , if it were . _ We _ were always good friends , and now we are better . ”
George Wickham	“ I do not know . Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . And so , my dear sister , I find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . ”
George Wickham	“ I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . But of course she did not mention my name to you . ”
George Wickham	“ Yes , she did . ”
George Wickham	“ And what did she say ? ”
George Wickham	“ That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had -- not turned out well . At such a distance as _ that _ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . ”
George Wickham	“ I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . We passed each other several times . I wonder what he can be doing there . ”
George Wickham	“ Undoubtedly . Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . ”
George Wickham	“ And do you like her ? ”
George Wickham	“ I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . When I last saw her , she was not very promising . I am very glad you liked her . I hope she will turn out well . ”
George Wickham	“ Did you go by the village of Kympton ? ”
George Wickham	“ I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had . A most delightful place ! Excellent parsonage - house ! It would have suited me in every respect . ”
George Wickham	“ Exceedingly well . I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . One ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! But it was not to be . Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance when you were in Kent ? ”
George Wickham	“ You have ! Yes , there was something in _ that _ ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . ”
George Wickham	“ You did ! and it was not wholly without foundation . You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . ”
George Wickham	“ Oh , Lord ! I do n’t know . Not these two or three years , perhaps . ”
George Wickham	“ As often as I can . But you know married women have never much time for writing . My sisters may write to _ me _ . They will have nothing else to do . ”
Charles Bingley	“ When the Party entered ”
Charles Bingley	“ I certainly shall not . You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . ”
Charles Bingley	“ I would not be so fastidious as you are , ”
Charles Bingley	“ for a kingdom ! Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening ; and there are several of them , you see , uncommonly pretty . ”
Charles Bingley	“ Oh , she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say very agreeable . Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . ”
Charles Bingley	“ It is amazing to me , ”
Charles Bingley	“ how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are . ”
Charles Bingley	“ Yes , all of them , I think . They all paint tables , cover screens , and net purses . I scarcely know any one who can not do all this ; and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . ”
Charles Bingley	“ I did not know before , ”
Charles Bingley	“ that you were a studier of character . It must be an amusing study . ”
Charles Bingley	“ When I am in the country , ”
Charles Bingley	“ I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town , it is pretty much the same . They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . ”
Charles Bingley	“ She seems a very pleasant young woman , ”
Charles Bingley	“ I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and , when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball . But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill ? ”
Charles Bingley	“ Nay , ”
Charles Bingley	“ I am exceedingly gratified , ”
Charles Bingley	“ by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me if , under such a circumstance , I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could . ”
Charles Bingley	“ By all means , ”
Charles Bingley	“ let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size , for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening , when he has nothing to do . ”
Charles Bingley	“ was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; ”
Charles Bingley	“ It is above eight months . We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . ”
Charles Bingley	“ Where is your sister ? ”
Charles Bingley	“ With my mother upstairs . She will be down in a moment , I dare say . ”
Charles Bingley	“ Mrs. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? ”
Charles Bingley	“ It may do very well for the others , ”
Charles Bingley	“ but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . Wo n’t it , Kitty ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . She has two nieces of her own . She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Do n’t keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven ’s sake ! Have a little compassion on my nerves . You tear them to pieces . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ To - morrow fortnight . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _ her _ . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I honour your circumspection . A fortnight ’s acquaintance is certainly very little . One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . But if _ we _ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Nonsense , nonsense ! ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet ! But I knew I should persuade you at last . I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . Well , how pleased I am ! And it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Oh , my dear , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I am quite delighted with him . He is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women . I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses . I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst ’s gown---- ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ But I can assure you , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _ his _ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . So high and so conceited , that there was no enduring him ! He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! Not handsome enough to dance with ! I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set - downs . I quite detest the man . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ _ You _ began the evening well , Charlotte , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ _ You _ were Mr. Bingley ’s first choice . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Oh , you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced with her twice . To be sure that _ did _ seem as if he admired her -- indeed , I rather believe he _ did_--I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson : did not I mention it to you ? Mr. Robinson ’s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _ which _ he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question , ‘ Oh , the eldest Miss Bennet , beyond a doubt : there can not be two opinions on that point . ’ ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided , indeed -- that does seem as if -- but , however , it may all come to nothing , you know . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I beg you will not put it into Lizzy ’s head to be vexed by his ill - treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Without once opening his lips ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Ay , because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I do not believe a word of it , my dear . If he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to Mrs. Long . But I can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I believe , ma’am , I may safely promise you _ never _ to dance with him . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ and if I were to see you at it , I should take away your bottle directly . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I am astonished , my dear , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . If I wished to think slightingly of anybody ’s children , it should not be of my own , however . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Yes ; but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ My dear Mr. Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age , I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and , indeed , so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William ’s in his regimentals . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Well , Jane , who is it from ? What is it about ? What does he say ? Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ My dear friend , * /
Mrs. Bennet	“ If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives ; for a whole day ’s _ tête - à - tête _ between two women can never end without a quarrel . Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . Yours ever ,
Mrs. Bennet	“ CAROLINE BINGLEY . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Dining out , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ that is very unlucky . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Oh , but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley ’s chaise to go to Meryton ; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure . They are wanted in the farm , Mr. Bennet , are not they ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Indeed I have , sir , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ She is a great deal too ill to be moved . Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her . We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I am sure , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ if it was not for such good friends , I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I ever met with . I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _ her _ . You have a sweet room here , Mr. Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . You will not think of quitting it in a hurry , I hope , though you have but a short lease . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Yes , indeed , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I assure you there is quite as much of _ that _ going on in the country as in town . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I can not see that London has any great advantage over the country , for my part , except the shops and public places . The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr. Bingley ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Ay , that is because you have the right disposition . But that gentleman , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ seemed to think the country was nothing at all . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Who do you mean , my dear ? I know of nobody that is coming , I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in ; and I hope _ my _ dinners are good enough for her . I do not believe she often sees such at home . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ A gentleman and a stranger ! It is Mr. Bingley , I am sure . Why , Jane -- you never dropped a word of this -- you sly thing ! Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley . But -- good Lord ! how unlucky ! there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day . Lydia , my love , ring the bell . I must speak to Hill this moment . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ No , that I am sure I shall not : and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . I hate such false friends . Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Dear Sir ,
Mrs. Bennet	“ The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness ; and , since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach : but , for some time , I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance . ”--‘There
Mrs. Bennet	’--“My mind , however , is now made up on the subject ; for , having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England . As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . I can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologize for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends ; but of this hereafter . If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o’clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend ,
Mrs. Bennet	“ You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough . Things are settled so oddly . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ You allude , perhaps , to the entail of this estate . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Ah , sir , I do indeed . It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . Not that I mean to find fault with _ you _ , for such things , I know , are all chance in this world . There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . At present I will not say more , but , perhaps , when we are better acquainted---- ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . Does she live near you , sir ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her Ladyship ’s residence . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I think you said she was a widow , sir ? has she any family ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Ah , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ then she is better off than many girls . And what sort of young lady is she ? Is she handsome ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ She is a most charming young lady , indeed . Lady Catherine herself says that , in point of true beauty , Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of , as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them . But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Has she been presented ? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the British Court of its brightest ornament . Her Ladyship seemed pleased with the idea ; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess ; and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ But depend upon it , Mr. Collins , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . I will speak to her about it myself directly . She is a very headstrong , foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will _ make _ her know it . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Sir , you quite misunderstand me , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . In everything else she is as good - natured a girl as ever lived . I will go directly to Mr. Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy . Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins , and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Speak to Lizzy about it yourself . Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Very well -- and this offer of marriage you have refused ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I have , sir . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Very well . We now come to the point . Your mother insists upon your accepting it . Is it not so , Mrs. Bennet ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Yes , or I will never see her again . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do _ not _ marry Mr. Collins , and I will never see you again if you _ do _ . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ What do you mean , Mr. Bennet , by talking in this way ? You promised me to _ insist _ upon her marrying him . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me ; I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Ay , there she comes , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way . But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead . _ I _ shall not be able to keep you -- and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day . I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children . Not that I have much pleasure , indeed , in talking to anybody . People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . Those who do not complain are never pitied . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Oh , Mr. Collins ! ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and , depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I do not blame Jane , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could . But , Lizzy ! Oh , sister ! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins ’s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . The Lucases are very artful people , indeed , sister . They are all for what they can get . I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ _ wished _ they might be happy . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Well , Lizzy , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ what is your opinion _ now _ of this sad business of Jane ’s ? For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . I told my sister Philips so the other day . But I can not find out that Jane saw anything of him in London . Well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have inquired of everybody , too , who is likely to know . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Oh , well ! it is just as he chooses . Nobody wants him to come ; though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and , if I was her , I would not have put up with it . Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ If one could but go to Brighton ! ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ If I had been able , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ to carry my point in going to Brighton with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened : but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am . Poor , dear child ! And now here ’s Mr. Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Oh , my dear brother , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ that is exactly what I could most wish for . And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _ make _ them marry . And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married . And , above all things , keep Mr. Bennet from fighting . Tell him what a dreadful state I am in -- that I am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at my heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . Oh , brother , how kind you are ! I know you will contrive it all . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ What ! is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Sure he will not leave London before he has found them . Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Haye Park might do , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off . I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ E. GARDINER . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Oh , my dear Lydia , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ when shall we meet again ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Write to me very often , my dear . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Well , so much the better . Not that I care about it , though . He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . And who knows what _ may _ happen ? But that is nothing to us . You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . And so , it is quite certain he is coming ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes , my dear , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ you will wait on him , of course . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ It is a long time , Mr. Bingley , since you went away , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr. Bingley , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned . I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Next time you call , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I hope we shall be more lucky . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Can you come to - morrow ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . He is come -- Mr. Bingley is come . He is , indeed . Make haste , make haste . Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . Never mind Miss Lizzy ’s hair . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you . Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . No , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . That lady , I suppose , is your mother ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ And _ that _ , I suppose , is one of your sisters ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Yes , madam , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ She is my youngest girl but one . My youngest of all is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the ground , walking with a young man , who , I believe , will soon become a part of the family . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my Lady , I dare say ; but , I assure you , it is much larger than Sir William Lucas ’s . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ This must be a most inconvenient sitting - room for the evening in summer : the windows are full west . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well ? ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Yes , very well . I saw them the night before last . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ Good gracious ! ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? I had no notion but he would go a - shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . What shall we do with him ? Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley ’s way . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ to walk to Oakham Mount this morning . It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . ”
Mrs. Bennet	“ I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but I hope you will not mind it . It is all for Jane ’s sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then ; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I do not cough for my own amusement , ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ We will go as far as Meryton with you , ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Your father ’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins , I think ? For your sake , ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh ’s family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ A little . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Oh then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to ---- you shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ One of them does . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as yours . Do you draw ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ No , not at all . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ What , none of you ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Not one . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ That is very strange . But I suppose you had no opportunity . Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ My mother would have no objection , but my father hates London . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Has your governess left you ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ We never had any governess . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ No governess ! How was that possible ? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ You can not be more than twenty , I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I am not one - and - twenty . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ and pray tell her from me , that she can not expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master . She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne ’s . Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! But so they always are . The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely -- more , I think , than last year . His attachment to Rosings certainly increases . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . I expected you to stay two months . I told Mrs. Collins so before you came . There can be no occasion for your going so soon . Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Oh , your father , of course , may spare you , if your mother can . Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father . And if you will stay another _ month _ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche - box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and , indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Mrs. Collins , you must send a servant with them . You know I always speak my mind , and I can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . It is highly improper . You must contrive to send somebody . I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men - servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr. Darcy of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs. Collins . I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _ you _ to let them go alone . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ My uncle is to send a servant for us . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man - servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . Where shall you change horses ? Oh , Bromley , of course . If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _ me _ a great deal of good , ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I can not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _ me _ as well as Lydia , ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ though I am _ not _ her particular friend . I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ And Lydia used to want to go to London , ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I am not going to run away , papa , ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ If _ I _ should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ There is a gentleman with him , mamma , ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ who can it be ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ La ! ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . Mr. what ’s his name -- that tall , proud man . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ What is the matter , mamma ? What do you keep winking at me for ? What am I to do ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ You have a very small park here , ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Indeed , you are mistaken , madam ; I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Lady Catherine , I have nothing further to say . You know my sentiments . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I have said no such thing . I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to _ you _ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ And this is your real opinion ! This is your final resolve ! Very well . I shall now know how to act . Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . I came to try you . I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . I send no compliments to your mother . You deserve no such attention . I am most seriously displeased . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Mr. Darcy , I am a very selfish creature , and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours . I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . Were it known to the rest of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ You must not blame my aunt . Lydia ’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Upon my word , ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? What is it you are talking of ? What are you telling Miss Bennet ? Let me hear what it is . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Of music ! Then pray speak aloud . It is of all subjects my delight . I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient . And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Miss Bennet , ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ you ought to know that I am not to be trifled with . But however insincere _ you _ may choose to be , you shall not find _ me _ so . My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness ; and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago . I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that _ you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew -- my own nephew , Mr. Darcy . Though I _ know _ it must be a scandalous falsehood , though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ If ! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ And can you likewise declare , that there is no _ foundation _ for it ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ This is not to be borne . Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason . But _ your _ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . You may have drawn him in . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? I have not been accustomed to such language as this . I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Let me be rightly understood . This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place . No , never . Mr. Darcy is engaged to _ my daughter _ . Now , what have you to say ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . It was the favourite wish of _ his _ mother , as well as of hers . While in their cradles we planned the union ; and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends -- to his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh ? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Yes ; and I had heard it before . But what is that to me ? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh . You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage . Its completion depended on others . If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Because honour , decorum , prudence -- nay , interest -- forbid it . Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him . Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Obstinate , headstrong girl ! I am ashamed of you ! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? Is nothing due to me on that score ? Let us sit down . You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be dissuaded from it . I have not been used to submit to any person ’s whims . I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ _ That _ will make your Ladyship ’s situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _ me _ . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I will not be interrupted ! Hear me in silence . My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . They are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father ’s , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled , families . Their fortune on both sides is splendid . They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune ! Is this to be endured ? But it must not , shall not be ! If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman ’s daughter ; so far we are equal . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ True . You _ are _ a gentleman ’s daughter . But what was your mother ? Who are your uncles and aunts ? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Tell me , once for all , are you engaged to him ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I am not . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ I will make no promise of the kind . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Miss Bennet , I am shocked and astonished . I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede . I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ And I certainly _ never _ shall give it . I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable . Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise make _ their _ marriage at all more probable ? Supposing him to be attached to me , would _ my _ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged . You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these . How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _ his _ affairs , I can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no further on the subject . ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ Not so hasty , if you please . I have by no means done . To all the objections I have already urged I have still another to add . I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ’s infamous elopement . I know it all ; that the young man ’s marrying her was a patched - up business , at the expense of your father and uncle . And is _ such _ a girl to be my nephew ’s sister ? Is _ her _ husband , who is the son of his late father ’s steward , to be his brother ? Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking ? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! Unfeeling , selfish girl ! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ You are then resolved to have him ? ”
Lady Catherine de Bourgh	“ It is well . You refuse , then , to oblige me . You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Oh , ”
Lydia Bennet	“ I am not afraid ; for though I _ am _ the youngest , I ’m the tallest . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ He rode a black horse ”
Lydia Bennet	“ If my children are silly , I must hope to be always sensible of it . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Mamma , ”
Lydia Bennet	“ my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson ’s as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke ’s library . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ With the officers ! ”
Lydia Bennet	“ I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _ that _ . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ If we make haste , ”
Lydia Bennet	“ perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter , before he goes . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Oh yes -- it would be much better to wait till Jane was well ; and by that time , most likely , Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . And when you have given _ your _ ball , ”
Lydia Bennet	“ I shall insist on their giving one also . I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Fordyce ’s Sermons . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Do you know , mamma , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard ? and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him . My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Lord , how tired I am ! ”
Lydia Bennet	“ I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Good Lord ! Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? ”
Lydia Bennet	“ And we mean to treat you all , ”
Lydia Bennet	“ but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . ”
Lydia Bennet	purchases,--“Look here , I have bought this bonnet . I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Oh , but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the ----shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ They are going to be encamped near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all . Mamma would like to go , too , of all things ! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Now I have got some news for you , ”
Lydia Bennet	“ What do you think ? It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Ay , that is just like your formality and discretion . You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say . But he is an ugly fellow ! I am glad he is gone . I never saw such a long chin in my life . Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? There is no danger of Wickham ’s marrying Mary King -- there ’s for you ! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ; gone to stay . Wickham is safe . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ I am sure there is not on _ his _ . I will answer for it , he never cared three straws about her . Who _ could _ about such a nasty little freckled thing ? ”
Lydia Bennet	“ How nicely we are crammed in ! ”
Lydia Bennet	“ I am glad I brought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another band - box ! Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home . And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away . Have you seen any pleasant men ? Have you had any flirting ? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . She is almost three - and - twenty ! Lord ! how ashamed I should be of not being married before three - and - twenty ! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands you ca n’t think . She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins ; but _ I _ do not think there would have been any fun in it . Lord ! how I should like to be married before any of you ! and then I would _ chaperon _ you about to all the balls . Dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster ’s ! Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by - the - bye , Mrs. Forster and me are _ such _ friends ! ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come : but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman ’s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun ! Not a soul knew of it , but Colonel and Mrs. Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you can not imagine how well he looked ! When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . Lord ! how I laughed ! and so did Mrs. Forster . I thought I should have died . And _ that _ made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Oh , Mary , ”
Lydia Bennet	“ I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . And then when we came away it was such fun ! I thought we never should have got into the coach . I was ready to die of laughter . And then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that anybody might have heard us ten miles off ! ”
Lydia Bennet	“ I am sure I shall break _ mine _ , ”
Lydia Bennet	“ She is so fond of Mrs. Forster , ”
Lydia Bennet	“ it will be quite shocking to send her away ! And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . The officers may not be so pleasant in General---- ’s regiment . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Only think of its being three months , ”
Lydia Bennet	“ since I went away : it seems but a fortnight , I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . Good gracious ! when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Oh , mamma , do the people hereabouts know I am married to - day ? I was afraid they might not ; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like anything . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Ah , Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Mrs. Wickham ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Well , mamma , ”
Lydia Bennet	“ and what do you think of my husband ? Is not he a charming man ? I am sure my sisters must all envy me . I only hope they may have half my good luck . They must all go to Brighton . That is the place to get husbands . What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go ! ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Oh , Lord ! yes ; there is nothing in that . I shall like it of all things . You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ Thank you , ”
Lydia Bennet	“ for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be so angry . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed ; but do n’t imagine it was from any silly cause . I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I _ should _ be looked at . I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . Not that I am afraid of _ myself _ , but I dread other people ’s remarks . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ It has been a very agreeable day , ”
Lydia Bennet	“ The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . I hope we may often meet again . ”
Lydia Bennet	“ My dear Lizzy , * /
Lydia Bennet	“ Yours , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ No more have I , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country . I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Well , my dear , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness -- if she should die -- it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley , and under your orders . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ I hope , my dear , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . But if you will listen to his letter , you may , perhaps , be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , _ 15th October _ . * /
Mr. Bennet	“ WILLIAM COLLINS . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ At four o’clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and , I doubt not , will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ There is some sense in what he says about the girls , however ; and , if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ You judge very properly , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? ”
Mr. Bennet	“ They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time ; and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Oh , Mr. Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins , for she vows she will not have him ; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _ her _ . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ I have not the pleasure of understanding you , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Of what are you talking ? ”
Mr. Bennet	“ And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems a hopeless business . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Let her be called down . She shall hear my opinion . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ I leave it to yourself to determine , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ So , Lizzy , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ your sister is crossed in love , I find . I congratulate her . Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . When is your turn to come ? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane . Now is your time . Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . Let Wickham be your man . He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ True , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Already arisen ! ”
Mr. Bennet	“ What ! has she frightened away some of your lovers ? Poor little Lizzy ! But do not be cast down . Such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret . Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia ’s folly . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Indeed , you are mistaken . I have no such injuries to resent . It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining . Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia ’s character . Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly . If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . Her character will be fixed ; and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . She will follow wherever Lydia leads . Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrolled ! Oh , my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or I may say , three -- very silly sisters . We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . Let her go , then . Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody . At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . The officers will find women better worth their notice . Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Do not give way to useless alarm , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . In a few days more , we may gain some news of them ; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Say nothing of that . Who should suffer but myself ? It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ He is as fine a fellow , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ as ever I saw . He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . I am prodigiously proud of him . I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son - in - law . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ Jane , I congratulate you . You will be a very happy woman . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ You are a good girl , ”
Mr. Bennet	“ and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . Your tempers are by no means unlike . You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . ”
Mr. Bennet	“ I must trouble you once more for congratulations . Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy . Console Lady Catherine as well as you can . But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . He has more to give .
Caroline Bingley	“ Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I am all astonishment . How long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am I to wish you joy ? ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ but this was all lost upon me . I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning . Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ _ You _ observed it , Mr. Darcy , I am sure , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _ your sister _ make such an exhibition . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Certainly not . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! what could she mean by it ? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country - town indifference to decorum . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I am afraid , Mr. Darcy , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton ? ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ If they had uncles enough to fill _ all _ Cheapside , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ it would not make them one jot less agreeable . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Miss Eliza Bennet , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ despises cards . She is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I am astonished , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr. Darcy ! ”
Caroline Bingley	“ And then you have added so much to it yourself -- you are always buying books . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Neglect ! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . Charles , when you build _ your _ house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I am talking of possibilities , Charles . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? ”
Caroline Bingley	“ will she be as tall as I am ? ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I think she will . She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet ’s height , or rather taller . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ How I long to see her again ! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . Such a countenance , such manners , and so extremely accomplished for her age ! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ All young ladies accomplished ! My dear Charles , what do you mean ? ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Nor I , I am sure , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Eliza Bennet , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , I daresay , it succeeds ; but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Removed ! ”
Caroline Bingley	“ It must not be thought of . My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ You may depend upon it , madam , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Oh , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable . He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I hope , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , to cure the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ No , no ; stay where you are ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity ? ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Oh yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . Put them next to your great - uncle the judge . They are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines . As for your Elizabeth ’s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? ”
Caroline Bingley	“ It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression ; but their colour and shape , and the eyelashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I did not know that you intended to walk , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! I declare , after all , there is no enjoyment like reading ! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book ! When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ By the bye Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it begins ; but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing , and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I should like balls infinitely better , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say ; but it would not be near so much like a ball . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Oh , shocking ! ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I never heard anything so abominable . How shall we punish him for such a speech ? ”
Caroline Bingley	“ But upon my honour I do _ not _ . I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _ that _ . Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind ! No , no ; I feel he may defy us there . And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . Mr. Darcy may hug himself . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over , I presume , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ and pray what is the result ? ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Do let us have a little music , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ? Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr. Darcy ’s steward . Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for , as to Mr. Darcy ’s using him ill , it is perfectly false : for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner . I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame ; that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned ; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ’s guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I beg your pardon , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Excuse my interference ; it was kindly meant . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton ? They must be a great loss to _ your _ family . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr. Darcy , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter . She is grown so brown and coarse ! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ For my own part , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . Her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive anything extraordinary in them . They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ‘ _ She _ a beauty ! I should as soon call her mother a wit . ’ But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . ”
Caroline Bingley	“ Yours sincerely , ”
Caroline Bingley	“ O that my dear mother had more command over herself ! she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . But I will not repine . It can not last long . He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ _ My _ overhearings were more to the purpose than _ yours _ , Eliza , ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just _ tolerable _ . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ It may , perhaps , be pleasant , ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . We can all _ begin _ freely -- a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better show _ more _ affection than she feels . Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane ’s disposition as you do . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ Not as you represent it . Had she merely _ dined _ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ Well , ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar beforehand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ I dare say you will find him very agreeable . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ Heaven forbid ! _ That _ would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ Engaged to Mr. Collins ! my dear Charlotte , impossible ! ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman ’s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ I see what you are feeling , ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you . But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . I am not romantic , you know . I never was . I ask only a comfortable home ; and , considering Mr. Collins ’s character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ _ That _ you certainly shall . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ And I have another favour to ask . Will you come and see me ? ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ My father and Maria are to come to me in March , ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ and I hope you will consent to be of the party . Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman , indeed , ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ and a most attentive neighbour . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ What can be the meaning of this ? ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ My dear Eliza , he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long , ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ but I wish he had danced with Eliza . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ His pride , ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ does not offend _ me _ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . One can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , everything in his favour , should think highly of himself . If I may so express it , he has a _ right _ to be proud . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ Did not you think , Mr. Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ You are severe on us . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ It will be _ her _ turn soon to be teased , ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody ! If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable ; but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ Very well ; if it must be so , it must . ”
Charlotte Lucas	“ There is a very fine old saying , which everybody here is of course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and I shall keep mine to swell my song . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Offended two or three young ladies ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ But that expression of ‘ violently in love ’ is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . It is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour ’s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . Pray , how _ violent was _ Mr. Bingley ’s love ? ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . Poor Jane ! I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . It had better have happened to _ you _ , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? Change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ I hope , ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ And _ that _ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? Mr. Darcy may , perhaps , have _ heard _ of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month ’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and , depend upon it , Mr. Bingley never stirs without him . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ So much the better . I hope they will not meet at all . But does not Jane correspond with his sister ? _ She _ will not be able to help calling . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ She will drop the acquaintance entirely . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Will you come and see me ? ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him , in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . I have nothing to say against _ him _ : he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . But as it is -- you must not let your fancy run away with you . You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . Your father would depend on _ your _ resolution and good conduct , I am sure . You must not disappoint your father . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . I will take care of myself , and of Mr. Wickham too . He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Elizabeth , you are not serious now . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ I beg your pardon . I will try again . At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw -- and if he becomes really attached to me -- I believe it will be better that he should not . I see the imprudence of it . Oh , _ that _ abominable Mr. Darcy ! My father ’s opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to forfeit it . My father , however , is partial to Mr. Wickham . In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see , every day , that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld , by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow - creatures , if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wiser to resist ? All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . In short , I will do my best . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often . At least you should not _ remind _ your mother of inviting him . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	on:--“I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . But my feelings are not only cordial towards _ him _ , they are even impartial towards Miss King . I can not find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . There can be no love in all this . My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance . Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do . They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ On the Stairs ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ But , my dear Elizabeth , ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ what sort of girl is Miss King ? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . I know no harm of her . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather ’s death made her mistress of this fortune ? ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ No -- why should he ? If it were not allowable for him to gain _ my _ affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe . If _ she _ does not object to it , why should _ we _ ? ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ _ Her _ not objecting does not justify _ him _ . It only shows her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ No , Lizzy , that is what I do _ not _ choose . I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Take care , Lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ but perhaps , to the Lakes . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ If it were merely a fine house richly furnished , ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . They have some of the finest woods in the country . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ I have heard much of your master ’s fine person , ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ it is a handsome face . But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ His father was an excellent man , ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ From what we have seen of him , ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham . He has not an ill - natured look . On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . But , to be sure , the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character ! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and _ that _ , in the eye of a servant , comprehends every virtue . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ But what is to be done about Pemberley ? ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so ? ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . _ That _ is all settled . ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ Upon my word , ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ I begin to be of your uncle ’s opinion . It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . I can not think so very ill of Wickham . Can you , yourself , Lizzie , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? ”
Mrs. Gardiner	“ And do you really know all this ? ”
Sir William Lucas	“ What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr. Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing , after all . I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ Certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world : every savage can dance . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ Your friend performs delightfully , ”
Sir William Lucas	“ and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr. Darcy . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , sir . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . Do you often dance at St. James ’s ? ”
Sir William Lucas	“ Never , sir . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? ”
Sir William Lucas	“ It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ You have a house in town , I conclude ? ”
Sir William Lucas	“ Indeed , sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ He is , indeed : but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we can not wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? ”
Sir William Lucas	“ I can guess the subject of your reverie . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ I should imagine not . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner,--in such society ; and , indeed , I am quite of your opinion . I was never more annoyed ! The insipidity , and yet the noise -- the nothingness , and yet the self - importance , of all these people ! What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! ”
Sir William Lucas	“ Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . My mind was more agreeably engaged . I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ Miss Elizabeth Bennet . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . A lady ’s imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony , in a moment . I knew you would be wishing me joy . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ I have been most highly gratified , indeed , my dear sir ; such very superior dancing is not often seen . It is evident that you belong to the first circles . Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you : and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza ( glancing at her sister and Bingley ) , shall take place . What congratulations will then flow in ! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you , sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ Such very superior dancing is not often seen . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ Sir William ’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ I do not think we were speaking at all . Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I can not imagine . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ What think you of books ? ”
Sir William Lucas	“ Books -- oh no!--I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may compare our different opinions . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ No -- I can not talk of books in a ball - room ; my head is always full of something else . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ The _ present _ always occupies you in such scenes -- does it ? ”
Sir William Lucas	“ I am , ”
Sir William Lucas	“ I can readily believe , ”
Sir William Lucas	“ that reports may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . ”
Sir William Lucas	“ I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , ”
Sir William Lucas	“ I confess , ”
Sir William Lucas	“ that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship ’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation , moreover , including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ? ”
Sir William Lucas	“ I am the less surprised at what has happened , ”
Sir William Lucas	“ from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . About the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . ”
Georgiana Darcy	“ Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , ”
Georgiana Darcy	“ has too much truth . The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen ; but I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . I can not boast of knowing more than half - a - dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished . ”
Georgiana Darcy	“ Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . ”
Georgiana Darcy	“ All this she must possess , ”
Georgiana Darcy	“ and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . ”
Georgiana Darcy	“ Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this ? ”
Georgiana Darcy	“ Undoubtedly , ”
Georgiana Darcy	“ there is meanness in _ all _ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . ”
Georgiana Darcy	“ The country , ”
Georgiana Darcy	“ can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . ”
Georgiana Darcy	“ What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane ? ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ Oh , yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! She plays and sings all day long . In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master : she comes here to - morrow with him . ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ Not so much as I could wish , sir : but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ If your master would marry , you might see more of him . ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ In the first place , ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ Well , then,--supposing them to be in London -- they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose . It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ’s intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . If there were anyone that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . At present we have nothing to guide us . Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head . But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person . ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ It was greatly my wish that he should do so , ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ as soon as his marriage was fixed on . And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ’s . It is Mr. Wickham ’s intention to go into the Regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . He has the promise of an ensigncy in General---- ’s regiment , now quartered in the north . It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . He promises fairly ; and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself . And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information ? He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south . She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--Yours , etc .
Mr. Gardiner	“ There are very few people of whom so much can be said . You are lucky in having such a master . ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ He is perfectly well - behaved , polite , and unassuming , ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his Colonel ’s family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? His temptation is not adequate to the risk . ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . If , indeed , it should be so ! But I dare not hope it . Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ Oh , but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption ! And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road . ”
Mr. Gardiner	“ But why all this secrecy ? Why any fear of detection ? Why must their marriage be private ? Oh , no , no -- this is not likely . His most particular friend , you see by Jane ’s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . He can not afford it . And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father ’s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _ he _ would do as little and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . ”
Mary Bennet	“ Pride , ”
Mary Bennet	“ is a very common failing , I believe . By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonymously . A person may be proud without being vain . Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves ; vanity to what we would have others think of us . ”
Mary Bennet	“ I admire the activity of your benevolence , ”
Mary Bennet	“ but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . ”
Mary Bennet	“ In point of composition , ”
Mary Bennet	“ his letter does not seem defective . The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . ”
Mary Bennet	“ While I can have my mornings to myself , ”
Mary Bennet	“ it is enough . I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody . ”
Mary Bennet	“ Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures . They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . But I confess they would have no charms for _ me _ . I should infinitely prefer a book . ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ We were talking of music , madam , ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill - qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ I can answer your question , ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ without applying to him . It is because he will not give himself the trouble . ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ I have been making the tour of the park , ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ as I generally do every year , and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage . Are you going much farther ? ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ He likes to have his own way very well , ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ But so we all do . It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . I speak feelingly . A younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ These are home questions -- and perhaps I can not say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature . But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . Younger sons can not marry where they like . ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ Our habits of expense make us too dependent , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ No , ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ that is an advantage which he must divide with me . I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . ”
Colonel Fitzwilliam	“ There were some very strong objections against the lady , ”
Mr. Hurst	“ Do you prefer reading to cards ? ”
Mr. Hurst	“ that is rather singular . ”
Mr. Hurst	“ And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow ; and though I have not many , I have more than I ever looked into . ”
Mr. Hurst	“ It ought to be good , ”
Mr. Hurst	“ it has been the work of many generations . ”
Mr. Hurst	“ I can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . ”
Mr. Hurst	“ I wish it may . ”
Mr. Hurst	“ With all my heart : I will buy Pemberley itself , if Darcy will sell it . ”
Mr. Hurst	“ Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation . ”
Mrs. Hurst	“ She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . I shall never forget her appearance this morning . She really looked almost wild . ”
Mrs. Hurst	“ She did indeed , Louisa . I could hardly keep my countenance . Very nonsensical to come at all ! Why must _ she _ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? Her hair so untidy , so blowzy ! ”
Mrs. Hurst	“ Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain , and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office . ”
Mrs. Hurst	“ You used us abominably ill , ”
Mrs. Hurst	“ running away without telling us that you were coming out . ”
Lady Lucas	“ So much love and eloquence ”
