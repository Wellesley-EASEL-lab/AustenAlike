Fanny Price	“ no , no — not at all — no , thank you ”
Fanny Price	“ My uncle ! ”
Fanny Price	“ she could only say it was very unlucky , but some people _ were _ stupid , and Fanny must take more pains : she did not know what else was to be done ; and , except her being so dull , she must add she saw no harm in the poor little thing , and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages , and fetching what she wanted . ”
Fanny Price	“ So , Fanny , you are going to leave us , and live with my sister . How shall you like it ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Going to leave you ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , my dear ; why should you be astonished ? You have been five years with us , and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died . But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same . ”
Fanny Price	“ I shall be very sorry to go away , ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , I dare say you will ; _ that ’s _ natural enough . I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world . ”
Fanny Price	“ I hope I am not ungrateful , aunt , ”
Fanny Price	“ No , my dear ; I hope not . I have always found you a very good girl . ”
Fanny Price	“ And am I never to live here again ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Never , my dear ; but you are sure of a comfortable home . It can make very little difference to you , whether you are in one house or the other . ”
Fanny Price	“ Cousin , ”
Fanny Price	“ something is going to happen which I do not like at all ; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first , you will not be able to do it now . I am going to live entirely with my aunt Norris . ”
Fanny Price	“ Indeed ! ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes ; my aunt Bertram has just told me so . It is quite settled . I am to leave Mansfield Park , and go to the White House , I suppose , as soon as she is removed there . ”
Fanny Price	“ Well , Fanny , and if the plan were not unpleasant to you , I should call it an excellent one . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh , cousin ! ”
Fanny Price	“ It has everything else in its favour . My aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you . She is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought , and I am glad her love of money does not interfere . You will be what you ought to be to her . I hope it does not distress you very much , Fanny ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Indeed it does : I can not like it . I love this house and everything in it : I shall love nothing there . You know how uncomfortable I feel with her . ”
Fanny Price	“ I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child ; but it was the same with us all , or nearly so . She never knew how to be pleasant to children . But you are now of an age to be treated better ; I think she is behaving better already ; and when you are her only companion , you _ must _ be important to her . ”
Fanny Price	“ I can never be important to any one . ”
Fanny Price	“ What is to prevent you ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Everything . My situation , my foolishness and awkwardness . ”
Fanny Price	“ As to your foolishness and awkwardness , my dear Fanny , believe me , you never have a shadow of either , but in using the words so improperly . There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known . You have good sense , and a sweet temper , and I am sure you have a grateful heart , that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it . I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion . ”
Fanny Price	“ You are too kind , ”
Fanny Price	“ how shall I ever thank you as I ought , for thinking so well of me . Oh ! cousin , if I am to go away , I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life . ”
Fanny Price	“ Why , indeed , Fanny , I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House . You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park ; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever . The two families will be meeting every day in the year . The only difference will be that , living with your aunt , you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be . _ Here _ there are too many whom you can hide behind ; but with _ her _ you will be forced to speak for yourself . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh ! do not say so . ”
Fanny Price	“ I must say it , and say it with pleasure . Mrs. Norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now . She is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about , and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers . ”
Fanny Price	“ I can not see things as you do ; but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself , and I am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be . If I could suppose my aunt really to care for me , it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody . _ Here _ , I know , I am of none , and yet I love the place so well . ”
Fanny Price	“ The place , Fanny , is what you will not quit , though you quit the house . You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever . Even _ your _ constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change . You will have the same walks to frequent , the same library to choose from , the same people to look at , the same horse to ride . ”
Fanny Price	“ Very true . Yes , dear old grey pony ! Ah ! cousin , when I remember how much I used to dread riding , what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good ( oh ! how I have trembled at my uncle ’s opening his lips if horses were talked of ) , and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears , and convince me that I should like it after a little while , and feel how right you proved to be , I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well . ”
Fanny Price	“ And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health , and as much for your ultimate happiness too . ”
Fanny Price	“ Cut down an avenue ! What a pity ! Does it not make you think of Cowper ? ‘ Ye fallen avenues , once more I mourn your fate unmerited . ’ ”
Fanny Price	“ It would be delightful to _ me _ to see the progress of it all , ”
Fanny Price	“ Ay , you have been brought up to it . It was no part of my education ; and the only dose I ever had , being administered by not the first favourite in the world , has made me consider improvements _ in _ _ hand _ as the greatest of nuisances . Three years ago the Admiral , my honoured uncle , bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in ; and my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures ; but it being excessively pretty , it was soon found necessary to be improved , and for three months we were all dirt and confusion , without a gravel walk to step on , or a bench fit for use . I would have everything as complete as possible in the country , shrubberies and flower - gardens , and rustic seats innumerable : but it must all be done without my care . Henry is different ; he loves to be doing . ”
Fanny Price	“ When they are at a distance from all their family , ”
Fanny Price	“ they can write long letters . ”
Fanny Price	“ At sea , has she ? In the king ’s service , of course ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Among admirals , large enough ; but , ”
Fanny Price	“ we know very little of the inferior ranks . Post - captains may be very good sort of men , but they do not belong to _ us _ . Of various admirals I could tell you a great deal : of them and their flags , and the gradation of their pay , and their bickerings and jealousies . But , in general , I can assure you that they are all passed over , and all very ill used . Certainly , my home at my uncle ’s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals . Of _ Rears _ and _ Vices _ I saw enough . Now do not be suspecting me of a pun , I entreat . ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , the profession is well enough under two circumstances : if it make the fortune , and there be discretion in spending it ; but , in short , it is not a favourite profession of mine . It has never worn an amiable form to _ me _ . ”
Fanny Price	“ Do not you think , ”
Fanny Price	“ that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford , as her niece has been entirely brought up by her ? She can not have given her right notions of what was due to the Admiral . ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , except as to his writing her such short letters . She made me almost laugh ; but I can not rate so very highly the love or good - nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters , when they are separated . I am sure William would never have used _ me _ so , under any circumstances . And what right had she to suppose that _ you _ would not write long letters when you were absent ? ”
Fanny Price	“ No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse , I assure you , ”
Fanny Price	“ I am very strong . Nothing ever fatigues me but doing what I do not like . Miss Price , I give way to you with a very bad grace ; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride , and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear , delightful , beautiful animal . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , I do not know — not if you want the mare , ”
Fanny Price	“ I shall not ride to - morrow , certainly , ”
Fanny Price	“ I have been out very often lately , and would rather stay at home . You know I am strong enough now to walk very well . ”
Fanny Price	“ I am disappointed , ”
Fanny Price	“ This is not my idea of a chapel . There is nothing awful here , nothing melancholy , nothing grand . Here are no aisles , no arches , no inscriptions , no banners . No banners , cousin , to be ‘ blown by the night wind of heaven . ’ No signs that a ‘ Scottish monarch sleeps below . ’ ”
Fanny Price	“ You forget , Fanny , how lately all this has been built , and for how confined a purpose , compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries . It was only for the private use of the family . They have been buried , I suppose , in the parish church . _ There _ you must look for the banners and the achievements . ”
Fanny Price	“ It was foolish of me not to think of all that ; but I am disappointed . ”
Fanny Price	“ It is a pity , ”
Fanny Price	“ that the custom should have been discontinued . It was a valuable part of former times . There is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house , with one ’s ideas of what such a household should be ! A whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine ! ”
Fanny Price	“ Certainly , ”
Fanny Price	“ I do not think you ever will , ”
Fanny Price	“ I am just as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to take orders . You really are fit for something better . Come , do change your mind . It is not too late . Go into the law . ”
Fanny Price	“ Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two , but I forestall you ; remember , I have forestalled you . ”
Fanny Price	“ I wonder that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood ; but the next time we come to a seat , if it is not disagreeable to you , I should be glad to sit down for a little while . ”
Fanny Price	“ how thoughtless I have been ! I hope you are not very tired . Perhaps , ”
Fanny Price	“ my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm . ”
Fanny Price	“ Thank you , but I am not at all tired . ”
Fanny Price	“ I am really not tired , which I almost wonder at ; for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood . Do not you think we have ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh ! you do not consider how much we have wound about . We have taken such a very serpentine course , and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight line , for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path . ”
Fanny Price	“ But if you remember , before we left that first great path , we saw directly to the end of it . We looked down the whole vista , and saw it closed by iron gates , and it could not have been more than a furlong in length . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh ! I know nothing of your furlongs , but I am sure it is a very long wood , and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it ; and therefore , when I say that we have walked a mile in it , I must speak within compass . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh ! do not attack me with your watch . A watch is always too fast or too slow . I can not be dictated to by a watch . ”
Fanny Price	“ I shall soon be rested , ”
Fanny Price	“ to sit in the shade on a fine day , and look upon verdure , is the most perfect refreshment . ”
Fanny Price	“ Miss Price all alone ”
Fanny Price	“ My dear Fanny , how comes this ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Poor dear Fanny , ”
Fanny Price	“ how ill you have been used by them ! You had better have staid with us . ”
Fanny Price	“ You will hurt yourself , Miss Bertram , ”
Fanny Price	“ you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes ; you will tear your gown ; you will be in danger of slipping into the ha - ha . You had better not go . ”
Fanny Price	“ Thank you , my dear Fanny , but I and my gown are alive and well , and so good - bye . ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , yes , we saw him . He was posting away as if upon life and death , and could but just spare time to tell us his errand , and where you all were . ”
Fanny Price	“ It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing . ”
Fanny Price	“ _ That _ is Miss Maria ’s concern . I am not obliged to punish myself for _ her _ sins . The mother I could not avoid , as long as my tiresome aunt was dancing about with the housekeeper , but the son I _ can _ get away from . ”
Fanny Price	“ I am very sorry , ”
Fanny Price	“ it is very unlucky . ”
Fanny Price	“ It is a pity you should not join them . They expected to have a better view of the house from that part of the park , and will be thinking how it may be improved ; and nothing of that sort , you know , can be settled without you . ”
Fanny Price	“ But _ that _ I am sure it has not , ”
Fanny Price	“ It is the same sort of thing , ”
Fanny Price	“ as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy , or the son of a general to be in the army , and nobody sees anything wrong in that . Nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best , or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , ”
Fanny Price	“ but we need not give up his profession for all that ; because , whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen , he would have taken a — not a good temper into it ; and as he must , either in the navy or army , have had a great many more people under his command than he has now , I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman . Besides , I can not but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession , where he would have had less time and obligation — where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself , the _ frequency _ , at least , of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now . A man — a sensible man like Dr. Grant , can not be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week , can not go to church twice every Sunday , and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does , without being the better for it himself . It must make him think ; and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman . ”
Fanny Price	“ Here ’s harmony ! ”
Fanny Price	“ here ’s repose ! Here ’s what may leave all painting and all music behind , and what poetry only can attempt to describe ! Here ’s what may tranquillise every care , and lift the heart to rapture ! When I look out on such a night as this , I feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world ; and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more attended to , and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene . ”
Fanny Price	“ I like to hear your enthusiasm , Fanny . It is a lovely night , and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel , in some degree , as you do ; who have not , at least , been given a taste for Nature in early life . They lose a great deal . ”
Fanny Price	“ _ You _ taught me to think and feel on the subject , cousin . ”
Fanny Price	“ I had a very apt scholar . There ’s Arcturus looking very bright . ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , and the Bear . I wish I could see Cassiopeia . ”
Fanny Price	“ We must go out on the lawn for that . Should you be afraid ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Not in the least . It is a great while since we have had any star - gazing . ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes ; I do not know how it has happened . ”
Fanny Price	“ I am rather surprised , ”
Fanny Price	“ that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon , after being here so long before , full seven weeks ; for I had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about , that I thought something would certainly occur , when he was once gone , to take him elsewhere . He is used to much gayer places than Mansfield . ”
Fanny Price	“ What a favourite he is with my cousins ! ”
Fanny Price	“ If Miss Bertram were not engaged , ”
Fanny Price	“ I could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia . ”
Fanny Price	entered—“Such a horribly vile billiard - table as ours is not to be met with , I believe , above ground . I can stand it no longer , and I think , I may say , that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again ; but one good thing I have just ascertained : it is the very room for a theatre , precisely the shape and length for it ; and the doors at the farther end , communicating with each other , as they may be made to do in five minutes , by merely moving the bookcase in my father ’s room , is the very thing we could have desired , if we had sat down to wish for it ; and my father ’s room will be an excellent greenroom . It seems to join the billiard - room on purpose . ”
Fanny Price	“ I think it would be very wrong . In a _ general _ light , private theatricals are open to some objections , but as _ we _ are circumstanced , I must think it would be highly injudicious , and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind . It would shew great want of feeling on my father ’s account , absent as he is , and in some degree of constant danger ; and it would be imprudent , I think , with regard to Maria , whose situation is a very delicate one , considering everything , extremely delicate . ”
Fanny Price	“ Perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit them . Your brother ’s taste and your sisters ’ seem very different . ”
Fanny Price	“ I have no hope there , Fanny . If they persist in the scheme , they will find something . I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _ them _ , and that is all I can do . ”
Fanny Price	“ I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side . ”
Fanny Price	“ I dare say she would , but she has no influence with either Tom or my sisters that could be of any use ; and if I can not convince them myself , I shall let things take their course , without attempting it through her . Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all , and we had better do anything than be altogether by the ears . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh no , _ that _ will never do ! Let us have no ranting tragedies . Too many characters . Not a tolerable woman ’s part in the play . Anything but _ that _ , my dear Tom . It would be impossible to fill it up . One could not expect anybody to take such a part . Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end . _ That _ might do , perhaps , but for the low parts . If I _ must _ give my opinion , I have always thought it the most insipid play in the English language . _ I _ do not wish to make objections ; I shall be happy to be of any use , but I think we could not chuse worse . ”
Fanny Price	“ Me ! ”
Fanny Price	“ Indeed you must excuse me . I could not act anything if you were to give me the world . No , indeed , I can not act . ”
Fanny Price	“ It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart , ”
Fanny Price	“ but I really can not act . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , indeed , Mr. Bertram , you must excuse me . You can not have an idea . It would be absolutely impossible for me . If I were to undertake it , I should only disappoint you . ”
Fanny Price	“ You must excuse me , indeed you must excuse me , ”
Fanny Price	“ I do not like my situation : this _ place _ is too hot for me , ”
Fanny Price	“ Come in ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , certainly . ”
Fanny Price	“ I want to consult . I want your opinion . ”
Fanny Price	“ My opinion ! ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , your advice and opinion . I do not know what to do . This acting scheme gets worse and worse , you see . They have chosen almost as bad a play as they could , and now , to complete the business , are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us . This is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first . I know no harm of Charles Maddox ; but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable , the _ more _ than intimacy — the familiarity . I can not think of it with any patience ; and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must , _ if _ _ possible _ , be prevented . Do not you see it in the same light ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes ; but what can be done ? Your brother is so determined . ”
Fanny Price	“ There is but _ one _ thing to be done , Fanny . I must take Anhalt myself . I am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , ”
Fanny Price	“ not immediately , but — ”
Fanny Price	“ I am sorry for Miss Crawford ; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against , and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle . It will be such a triumph to the others ! ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , it will be a great point . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , I can not think of anything else . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh , cousin ! ”
Fanny Price	“ No doubt she will be very glad . It must be a great relief to her , ”
Fanny Price	“ I believe , ”
Fanny Price	“ there will be three acts rehearsed to - morrow evening , and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once . ”
Fanny Price	“ Thank you ; I am quite warm , very warm . Allow me to stay here a little while , and do have the goodness to hear me my third act . I have brought my book , and if you would but rehearse it with me , I should be _ so _ obliged ! I came here to - day intending to rehearse it with Edmund — by ourselves — against the evening , but he is not in the way ; and if he _ were _ , I do not think I could go through it with _ him _ , till I have hardened myself a little ; for really there is a speech or two . You will be so good , wo n’t you ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Have I ? I will do my best with the greatest readiness ; but I must _ read _ the part , for I can say very little of it . ”
Fanny Price	“ If Miss Price would be so good as to _ read _ the part . ”
Fanny Price	“ On your judgment , Edmund , I depended ; what have you been about ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh , not to _ him _ ! Look so to all the others , but not to _ him _ ! ”
Fanny Price	“ Do you think so ? ”
Fanny Price	“ in my opinion , my uncle would not like _ any _ addition . I think he values the very quietness you speak of , and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants . And it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be — I mean before my uncle went abroad . As well as I can recollect , it was always much the same . There was never much laughing in his presence ; or , if there is any difference , it is not more , I think , than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first . There must be a sort of shyness ; but I can not recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry , except when my uncle was in town . No young people ’s are , I suppose , when those they look up to are at home ”
Fanny Price	“ I suppose I am graver than other people , ”
Fanny Price	“ The evenings do not appear long to me . I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies . I could listen to him for an hour together . It entertains _ me _ more than many other things have done ; but then I am unlike other people , I dare say . ”
Fanny Price	“ Your uncle thinks you very pretty , dear Fanny — and that is the long and the short of the matter . Anybody but myself would have made something more of it , and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before ; but the truth is , that your uncle never did admire you till now — and now he does . Your complexion is so improved!—and you have gained so much countenance!—and your figure — nay , Fanny , do not turn away about it — it is but an uncle . If you can not bear an uncle ’s admiration , what is to become of you ? You must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at . You must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh ! do n’t talk so , do n’t talk so , ”
Fanny Price	“ But I do talk to him more than I used . I am sure I do . Did not you hear me ask him about the slave - trade last night ? ”
Fanny Price	“ And I longed to do it — but there was such a dead silence ! And while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word , or seeming at all interested in the subject , I did not like — I thought it would appear as if I wanted to set myself off at their expense , by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel . ”
Fanny Price	“ She must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you , ”
Fanny Price	“ to have any such apprehension . And Sir Thomas ’s wishing just at first to be only with his family , is so very natural , that she can argue nothing from that . After a little while , I dare say , we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way , allowing for the difference of the time of year . ”
Fanny Price	“ This is the first October that she has passed in the country since her infancy . I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country ; and November is a still more serious month , and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on . ”
Fanny Price	“ Where is Fanny ? ”
Fanny Price	“ What will you have ? ”
Fanny Price	“ But they are passed over , ”
Fanny Price	“ I have been watching them . This weather is all from the south . ”
Fanny Price	“ This is pretty , very pretty , ”
Fanny Price	“ every time I come into this shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty . Three years ago , this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field , never thought of as anything , or capable of becoming anything ; and now it is converted into a walk , and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament ; and perhaps , in another three years , we may be forgetting — almost forgetting what it was before . How wonderful , how very wonderful the operations of time , and the changes of the human mind ! ”
Fanny Price	“ If any one faculty of our nature may be called _ more _ wonderful than the rest , I do think it is memory . There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers , the failures , the inequalities of memory , than in any other of our intelligences . The memory is sometimes so retentive , so serviceable , so obedient ; at others , so bewildered and so weak ; and at others again , so tyrannic , so beyond control ! We are , to be sure , a miracle every way ; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out . ”
Fanny Price	“ It may seem impertinent in _ me _ to praise , but I must admire the taste Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this . There is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk ! Not too much attempted ! ”
Fanny Price	“ I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive ! ”
Fanny Price	“ My uncle ’s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own , and so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general . The evergreen ! How beautiful , how welcome , how wonderful the evergreen ! When one thinks of it , how astonishing a variety of nature ! In some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety , but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence . You will think me rhapsodising ; but when I am out of doors , especially when I am sitting out of doors , I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain . One can not fix one ’s eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy . ”
Fanny Price	“ _ Too _ quiet for you , I believe . ”
Fanny Price	“ Envy Mrs. Rushworth ! ”
Fanny Price	“ Come , come , it would be very un - handsome in us to be severe on Mrs. Rushworth , for I look forward to our owing her a great many gay , brilliant , happy hours . I expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton another year . Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing ; for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth ’s wife must be to fill her house , and give the best balls in the country . ”
Fanny Price	“ How differently we feel ! ”
Fanny Price	“ To me , the sound of _ Mr. _ Bertram is so cold and nothing - meaning , so entirely without warmth or character ! It just stands for a gentleman , and that ’s all . But there is nobleness in the name of Edmund . It is a name of heroism and renown ; of kings , princes , and knights ; and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections . ”
Fanny Price	“ I grant you the name is good in itself , and _ Lord _ Edmund or _ Sir _ Edmund sound delightfully ; but sink it under the chill , the annihilation of a Mr. , and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas . Well , shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting down out of doors at this time of year , by being up before they can begin ? ”
Fanny Price	“ but she did not suppose it would be in her power , ”
Fanny Price	“ If you can not do without me , ma’am — ”
Fanny Price	“ Thank you , I am _ so _ glad , ”
Fanny Price	“ And yet why should I be glad ? for am I not certain of seeing or hearing something there to pain me ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh ! depend upon it , your aunt can do very well without you , or you would not be allowed to go . _ I _ shall be here , so you may be quite easy about your aunt . And I hope you will have a very _ agreeable _ day , and find it all mighty _ delightful _ . But I must observe that five is the very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table ; and I can not but be surprised that such an _ elegant _ lady as Mrs. Grant should not contrive better ! And round their enormous great wide table , too , which fills up the room so dreadfully ! Had the doctor been contented to take my dining - table when I came away , as anybody in their senses would have done , instead of having that absurd new one of his own , which is wider , literally wider than the dinner - table here , how infinitely better it would have been ! and how much more he would have been respected ! for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere . Remember that , Fanny . Five — only five to be sitting round that table . However , you will have dinner enough on it for ten , I dare say . ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , sir , ”
Fanny Price	“ Never happier!—never happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable!—never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly ! Oh ! what a corrupted mind ! ”
Fanny Price	“ As far as _ I _ am concerned , sir , I would not have delayed his return for a day . My uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive , that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough . ”
Fanny Price	“ The most interesting in the world , ”
Fanny Price	brother—“how to make money ; how to turn a good income into a better . Dr. Grant is giving Bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon . I find he takes orders in a few weeks . They were at it in the dining - parlour . I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off . He will have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with , and earned without much trouble . I apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year . Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother ; and as of course he will still live at home , it will be all for his _ menus _ _ plaisirs _ ; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter , I suppose , will be the sum total of sacrifice . ”
Fanny Price	“ Will he not feel this ? ”
Fanny Price	“ No , he can feel nothing as he ought . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh ! cousin , stop a moment , pray stop ! ”
Fanny Price	“ I can not attempt to thank you , ”
Fanny Price	“ thanks are out of the question . I feel much more than I can possibly express . Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond — ”
Fanny Price	“ If that is all you have to say , Fanny ”
Fanny Price	“ No , no , it is not . I want to consult you . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh , this is beautiful indeed ! This is the very thing , precisely what I wished for ! This is the only ornament I have ever had a desire to possess . It will exactly suit my cross . They must and shall be worn together . It comes , too , in such an acceptable moment . Oh , cousin , you do not know how acceptable it is . ”
Fanny Price	“ My dear Fanny , you feel these things a great deal too much . I am most happy that you like the chain , and that it should be here in time for to - morrow ; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion . Believe me , I have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours . No , I can safely say , I have no pleasure so complete , so unalloyed . It is without a drawback . ”
Fanny Price	“ If it had been given to me in the first instance , ”
Fanny Price	“ I should not have thought of returning it ; but being her brother ’s present , is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it , when it is not wanted ? ”
Fanny Price	“ No , it is not handsomer , not at all handsomer in its way , and , for my purpose , not half so fit . The chain will agree with William ’s cross beyond all comparison better than the necklace . ”
Fanny Price	“ My very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept ”
Fanny Price	“ Suppose I were to find him there again to - day ! ”
Fanny Price	“ I am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you . This ought to be a day of pleasure . My uncle meant it so . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh yes , yes ! and it will be a day of pleasure . It will all end right . I am only vexed for a moment . In fact , it is not that I consider the ball as ill - timed ; what does it signify ? But , Fanny , ”
Fanny Price	“ you know what all this means . You see how it is ; and could tell me , perhaps better than I could tell you , how and why I am vexed . Let me talk to you a little . You are a kind , kind listener . I have been pained by her manner this morning , and can not get the better of it . I know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own , but the influence of her former companions makes her seem — gives to her conversation , to her professed opinions , sometimes a tinge of wrong . She does not _ think _ evil , but she speaks it , speaks it in playfulness ; and though I know it to be playfulness , it grieves me to the soul . ”
Fanny Price	“ The effect of education , ”
Fanny Price	“ If you only want me as a listener , cousin , I will be as useful as I can ; but I am not qualified for an adviser . Do not ask advice of _ me _ . I am not competent . ”
Fanny Price	“ You are right , Fanny , to protest against such an office , but you need not be afraid . It is a subject on which I should never ask advice ; it is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked ; and few , I imagine , do ask it , but when they want to be influenced against their conscience . I only want to talk to you . ”
Fanny Price	“ One thing more . Excuse the liberty ; but take care _ how _ you talk to me . Do not tell me anything now , which hereafter you may be sorry for . The time may come — ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , cousin , I am convinced that _ you _ would be incapable of anything else , though perhaps some might not . I can not be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say . Do not check yourself . Tell me whatever you like . ”
Fanny Price	“ Chapman helped her to dress . I sent Chapman to her . ”
Fanny Price	“ Perhaps _ you _ can tell me why my brother goes to town to - morrow ? He says he has business there , but will not tell me what . The first time he ever denied me his confidence ! But this is what we all come to . All are supplanted sooner or later . Now , I must apply to you for information . Pray , what is Henry going for ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh ! yes , sir , ”
Fanny Price	“ I must get up and breakfast with him . It will be the last time , you know ; the last morning . ”
Fanny Price	“ You had better not . He is to have breakfasted and be gone by half - past nine . Mr. Crawford , I think you call for him at half - past nine ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Well , well ! ”
Fanny Price	game—“And _ that _ makes thirty - one ; four in hand and eight in crib . You are to deal , ma’am ; shall I deal for you ? ”
Fanny Price	“ I do not know , ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes ; I had not particularly expected it . ”
Fanny Price	“ He did not , the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before . ”
Fanny Price	“ I only heard a part of the letter ; it was to my uncle ; but I believe it was very short ; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines . All that I heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer , and that he had agreed to do so . A _ few _ days longer , or _ some _ days longer ; I am not quite sure which . ”
Fanny Price	“ Three grown up . ”
Fanny Price	“ I do not at all know . I never heard . ”
Fanny Price	“ I know nothing of the Miss Owens , ”
Fanny Price	“ You can not doubt your being missed by many , ”
Fanny Price	“ You will be very much missed . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , ”
Fanny Price	“ I do not expect it at all . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , I do not , ”
Fanny Price	“ The more I think of it , ”
Fanny Price	“ the more am I convinced that you are doing quite right ; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you , I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy . Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed . You will both find your good in it . ”
Fanny Price	“ Has this been all _ your _ doing , then ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Good heaven ! how very , very kind ! Have you really — was it by _ your _ desire ? I beg your pardon , but I am bewildered . Did Admiral Crawford apply ? How was it ? I am stupefied . ”
Fanny Price	“ I will go to my uncle . My uncle ought to know it as soon as possible . ”
Fanny Price	“ Do n’t , Mr. Crawford , pray do n’t ! I beg you would not . This is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me . I must go away . I can not bear it . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , no , no ! ”
Fanny Price	“ This is all nonsense . Do not distress me . I can hear no more of this . Your kindness to William makes me more obliged to you than words can express ; but I do not want , I can not bear , I must not listen to such — No , no , do n’t think of me . But you are _ not _ thinking of me . I know it is all nothing . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh yes ! certainly , ”
Fanny Price	“ I am very much obliged to you , my dear Miss Crawford , for your kind congratulations , as far as they relate to my dearest William . The rest of your note I know means nothing ; but I am so unequal to anything of the sort , that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice . I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his manners ; if he understood me as well , he would , I dare say , behave differently . I do not know what I write , but it would be a great favour of you never to mention the subject again . With thanks for the honour of your note ,
Fanny Price	”
Fanny Price	“ I am not cold , sir : I never sit here long at this time of year . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , sir . ”
Fanny Price	“ my aunt Norris ”
Fanny Price	“ You are mistaken , sir , ”
Fanny Price	“ you are quite mistaken . How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing ? I gave him no encouragement yesterday . On the contrary , I told him , I can not recollect my exact words , but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him , that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect , and that I begged him never to talk to me in that manner again . I am sure I said as much as that and more ; and I should have said still more , if I had been quite certain of his meaning anything seriously ; but I did not like to be , I could not bear to be , imputing more than might be intended . I thought it might all pass for nothing with _ him _ . ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , ”
Fanny Price	“ I am very sorry , ”
Fanny Price	“ I am very sorry indeed . ”
Fanny Price	“ Sorry ! yes , I hope you are sorry ; and you will probably have reason to be long sorry for this day ’s transactions . ”
Fanny Price	“ If it were possible for me to do otherwise ”
Fanny Price	“ but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him happy , and that I should be miserable myself . ”
Fanny Price	“ I must be a brute , indeed , if I can be really ungrateful ! ”
Fanny Price	“ Heaven defend me from being ungrateful ! ”
Fanny Price	“ If I had known you were going out , I should have got you just to go as far as my house with some orders for Nanny , ”
Fanny Price	“ which I have since , to my very great inconvenience , been obliged to go and carry myself . I could very ill spare the time , and you might have saved me the trouble , if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were going out . It would have made no difference to you , I suppose , whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house . ”
Fanny Price	“ Indeed , sir , ”
Fanny Price	“ I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should continue to — I know that it is paying me a very great compliment , and I feel most undeservedly honoured ; but I am so perfectly convinced , and I have told him so , that it never will be in my power — ”
Fanny Price	“ My dear aunt , _ you _ can not wish me to do differently from what I have done , I am sure . _ You _ can not wish me to marry ; for you would miss me , should not you ? Yes , I am sure you would miss me too much for that . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , my dear , I should not think of missing you , when such an offer as this comes in your way . I could do very well without you , if you were married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford . And you must be aware , Fanny , that it is every young woman ’s duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this . ”
Fanny Price	“ No , indeed , you know your duty too well for me to — even supposing — ”
Fanny Price	“ A most desirable Estate in South Wales ”
Fanny Price	“ Pray , sir , do n’t ; pray , Mr. Crawford , ”
Fanny Price	“ Perhaps , sir , ”
Fanny Price	speaking—“perhaps , sir , I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as you seemed to do at that moment . ”
Fanny Price	“ If you hear of it from everybody , cousin , there can be nothing for me to tell . ”
Fanny Price	“ I am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what I feel . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh no ! But I thought you blamed me . I thought you were against me . This is such a comfort ! ”
Fanny Price	“ My uncle thought me wrong , and I knew he had been talking to you . ”
Fanny Price	“ So far your conduct has been faultless , and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise . But the matter does not end here . Crawford ’s is no common attachment ; he perseveres , with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before . This , we know , must be a work of time . But ”
Fanny Price	“ let him succeed at last , Fanny , let him succeed at last . You have proved yourself upright and disinterested , prove yourself grateful and tender - hearted ; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always believed you born for . ”
Fanny Price	“ Oh ! never , never , never ! he never will succeed with me . ”
Fanny Price	“ I mean , ”
Fanny Price	“ that I _ think _ I never shall , as far as the future can be answered for ; I think I never shall return his regard . ”
Fanny Price	“ We are so totally unlike , ”
Fanny Price	“ we are so very , very different in all our inclinations and ways , that I consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together , even if I _ could _ like him . There never were two people more dissimilar . We have not one taste in common . We should be miserable . ”
Fanny Price	“ It is not merely in _ temper _ that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself ; though , in _ that _ respect , I think the difference between us too great , infinitely too great : his spirits often oppress me ; but there is something in him which I object to still more . I must say , cousin , that I can not approve his character . I have not thought well of him from the time of the play . I then saw him behaving , as it appeared to me , so very improperly and unfeelingly — I may speak of it now because it is all over — so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth , not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him , and paying attentions to my cousin Maria , which — in short , at the time of the play , I received an impression which will never be got over . ”
Fanny Price	“ As a bystander , ”
Fanny Price	“ perhaps I saw more than you did ; and I do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous . ”
Fanny Price	“ Before the play , I am much mistaken if _ Julia _ did not think he was paying her attentions . ”
Fanny Price	“ I am persuaded that he does not think , as he ought , on serious subjects . ”
Fanny Price	“ I would not engage in such a charge , ”
Fanny Price	“ in such an office of high responsibility ! ”
Fanny Price	“ Was Mrs. Grant in the room , then ? ”
Fanny Price	“ It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford . ”
Fanny Price	“ I knew she would be very angry with me . ”
Fanny Price	“ And Mrs. Grant , did she say — did she speak ; was she there all the time ? ”
Fanny Price	“ I _ should _ have thought , ”
Fanny Price	“ that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man ’s not being approved , not being loved by some one of her sex at least , let him be ever so generally agreeable . Let him have all the perfections in the world , I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself . But , even supposing it is so , allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has , how was I to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own ? He took me wholly by surprise . I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning ; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me . In my situation , it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on Mr. Crawford . I am sure his sisters , rating him as they do , must have thought it so , supposing he had meant nothing . How , then , was I to be — to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me ? How was I to have an attachment at his service , as soon as it was asked for ? His sisters should consider me as well as him . The higher his deserts , the more improper for me ever to have thought of him . And , and — we think very differently of the nature of women , if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply . ”
Fanny Price	“ Ha ! ”
Fanny Price	“ am I here again ? The East room ! Once only was I in this room before ”
Fanny Price	“ Once only before . Do you remember it ? I came to rehearse . Your cousin came too ; and we had a rehearsal . You were our audience and prompter . A delightful rehearsal . I shall never forget it . Here we were , just in this part of the room : here was your cousin , here was I , here were the chairs . Oh ! why will such things ever pass away ? ”
Fanny Price	“ The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable ! The subject of it so very — very — what shall I say ? He was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me . I think I see him now , trying to be as demure and composed as Anhalt ought , through the two long speeches . ‘ When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state , matrimony may be called a happy life . ’ I suppose no time can ever wear out the impression I have of his looks and voice as he said those words . It was curious , very curious , that we should have such a scene to play ! If I had the power of recalling any one week of my existence , it should be that week — that acting week . Say what you would , Fanny , it should be _ that _ ; for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other . His sturdy spirit to bend as it did ! Oh ! it was sweet beyond expression . But alas , that very evening destroyed it all . That very evening brought your most unwelcome uncle . Poor Sir Thomas , who was glad to see you ? Yet , Fanny , do not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas , though I certainly did hate him for many a week . No , I do him justice now . He is just what the head of such a family should be . Nay , in sober sadness , I believe I now love you all . ”
Fanny Price	“ I have had a little fit since I came into this room , as you may perceive , ”
Fanny Price	“ but it is over now ; so let us sit down and be comfortable ; for as to scolding you , Fanny , which I came fully intending to do , I have not the heart for it when it comes to the point . ”
Fanny Price	“ Good , gentle Fanny ! when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long , I feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you . ”
Fanny Price	“ last . ”
Fanny Price	“ But you are only going from one set of friends to another . You are going to a very particular friend . ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , very true . Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years . But I have not the least inclination to go near her . I can think only of the friends I am leaving : my excellent sister , yourself , and the Bertrams in general . You have all so much more _ heart _ among you than one finds in the world at large . You all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you , which in common intercourse one knows nothing of . I wish I had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till after Easter , a much better time for the visit , but now I can not put her off . And when I have done with her I must go to her sister , Lady Stornaway , because _ she _ was rather my most particular friend of the two , but I have not cared much for _ her _ these three years . ”
Fanny Price	“ How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for you upstairs , and setting off to find my way to the East room , without having an idea whereabouts it was ! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came along , and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work ; and then your cousin ’s astonishment , when he opened the door , at seeing me here ! To be sure , your uncle ’s returning that very evening ! There never was anything quite like it . ”
Fanny Price	“ Why , Fanny , you are absolutely in a reverie . Thinking , I hope , of one who is always thinking of you . Oh ! that I could transport you for a short time into our circle in town , that you might understand how your power over Henry is thought of there ! Oh ! the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens ; the wonder , the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done ! For as to secrecy , Henry is quite the hero of an old romance , and glories in his chains . You should come to London to know how to estimate your conquest . If you were to see how he is courted , and how I am courted for his sake ! Now , I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you . When she comes to know the truth she will , very likely , wish me in Northamptonshire again ; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser , by a first wife , whom she is wild to get married , and wants Henry to take . Oh ! she has been trying for him to such a degree . Innocent and quiet as you sit here , you can not have an idea of the _ sensation _ that you will be occasioning , of the curiosity there will be to see you , of the endless questions I shall have to answer ! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth , and how you do your hair , and who makes your shoes . I wish Margaret were married , for my poor friend ’s sake , for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people . And yet it was a most desirable match for Janet at the time . We were all delighted . She could not do otherwise than accept him , for he was rich , and she had nothing ; but he turns out ill - tempered and _ exigeant _ , and wants a young woman , a beautiful young woman of five - and - twenty , to be as steady as himself . And my friend does not manage him well ; she does not seem to know how to make the best of it . There is a spirit of irritation which , to say nothing worse , is certainly very ill - bred . In their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect . Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister , and a certain consideration for her judgment , which makes one feel there _ is _ attachment ; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers . I shall be at Mansfield for ever , Fanny . My own sister as a wife , Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband , are my standards of perfection . Poor Janet has been sadly taken in , and yet there was nothing improper on her side : she did not run into the match inconsiderately ; there was no want of foresight . She took three days to consider of his proposals , and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having , and especially applied to my late dear aunt , whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance , and she was decidedly in favour of Mr. Fraser . This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort . I have not so much to say for my friend Flora , who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway , who has about as much sense , Fanny , as Mr. Rushworth , but much worse - looking , and with a blackguard character . I _ had _ my doubts at the time about her being right , for he has not even the air of a gentleman , and now I am sure she was wrong . By the bye , Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter she came out . But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him , I should never have done . It is you , only you , insensible Fanny , who can think of him with anything like indifference . But are you so insensible as you profess yourself ? No , no , I see you are not . ”
Fanny Price	“ I will not say , ”
Fanny Price	“ that I was not half afraid at the time of its being so , for there was something in your look that frightened me , but not at first ; I was as unsuspicious of it at first — indeed , indeed I was . It is as true as that I sit here . And had I had an idea of it , nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace . As to your brother ’s behaviour , certainly I was sensible of a particularity : I had been sensible of it some little time , perhaps two or three weeks ; but then I considered it as meaning nothing : I put it down as simply being his way , and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me . I had not , Miss Crawford , been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn . I was quiet , but I was not blind . I could not but see that Mr. Crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing . ”
Fanny Price	“ I can not think well of a man who sports with any woman ’s feelings ; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander - by can judge of . ”
Fanny Price	“ mama ”
Fanny Price	“ The Thrush is gone out of harbour , please sir , and one of the officers has been here to — ”
Fanny Price	“ She had been into the kitchen , ”
Fanny Price	“ to hurry Sally and help make the toast , and spread the bread and butter , or she did not know when they should have got tea , and she was sure her sister must want something after her journey . ”
Fanny Price	“ What have you got there , my love ? ”
Fanny Price	“ come and shew it to me . ”
Fanny Price	“ And now that I have begun , ”
Fanny Price	“ my letter will not be worth your reading , for there will be no little offering of love at the end , no three or four lines _ passionnées _ from the most devoted H. C. in the world , for Henry is in Norfolk ; business called him to Everingham ten days ago , or perhaps he only pretended the call , for the sake of being travelling at the same time that you were . But there he is , and , by the bye , his absence may sufficiently account for any remissness of his sister ’s in writing , for there has been no ‘ Well , Mary , when do you write to Fanny ? Is not it time for you to write to Fanny ? ’ to spur me on . At last , after various attempts at meeting , I have seen your cousins , ‘ dear Julia and dearest Mrs. Rushworth ’ ; they found me at home yesterday , and we were glad to see each other again . We _ seemed _ _ very _ glad to see each other , and I do really think we were a little . We had a vast deal to say . Shall I tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was mentioned ? I did not use to think her wanting in self - possession , but she had not quite enough for the demands of yesterday . Upon the whole , Julia was in the best looks of the two , at least after you were spoken of . There was no recovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke of ‘ Fanny , ’ and spoke of her as a sister should . But Mrs. Rushworth ’s day of good looks will come ; we have cards for her first party on the 28th . Then she will be in beauty , for she will open one of the best houses in Wimpole Street . I was in it two years ago , when it was Lady Lascelle ’s , and prefer it to almost any I know in London , and certainly she will then feel , to use a vulgar phrase , that she has got her pennyworth for her penny . Henry could not have afforded her such a house . I hope she will recollect it , and be satisfied , as well as she may , with moving the queen of a palace , though the king may appear best in the background ; and as I have no desire to tease her , I shall never _ force _ your name upon her again . She will grow sober by degrees . From all that I hear and guess , Baron Wildenheim ’s attentions to Julia continue , but I do not know that he has any serious encouragement . She ought to do better . A poor honourable is no catch , and I can not imagine any liking in the case , for take away his rants , and the poor baron has nothing . What a difference a vowel makes ! If his rents were but equal to his rants ! Your cousin Edmund moves slowly ; detained , perchance , by parish duties . There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted . I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a _ young _ one . Adieu ! my dear sweet Fanny , this is a long letter from London : write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry ’s eyes , when he comes back , and send me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake . ”
Fanny Price	“ William ’s friend , ”
Fanny Price	“ then by this time it is all settled , ”
Fanny Price	“ I have to inform you , my dearest Fanny , that Henry has been down to Portsmouth to see you ; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday , and one still more to be dwelt on the next day , on the ramparts ; when the balmy air , the sparkling sea , and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony , and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect . This , as well as I understand , is to be the substance of my information . He makes me write , but I do not know what else is to be communicated , except this said visit to Portsmouth , and these two said walks , and his introduction to your family , especially to a fair sister of yours , a fine girl of fifteen , who was of the party on the ramparts , taking her first lesson , I presume , in love . I have not time for writing much , but it would be out of place if I had , for this is to be a mere letter of business , penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information , which could not be delayed without risk of evil . My dear , dear Fanny , if I had you here , how I would talk to you ! You should listen to me till you were tired , and advise me till you were still tired more ; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper , so I will abstain altogether , and leave you to guess what you like . I have no news for you . You have politics , of course ; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people and parties that fill up my time . I ought to have sent you an account of your cousin ’s first party , but I was lazy , and now it is too long ago ; suffice it , that everything was just as it ought to be , in a style that any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness , and that her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit . My friend , Mrs. Fraser , is mad for such a house , and it would not make _ me _ miserable . I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter ; she seems in high spirits , and very happy . I fancy Lord S. is very good - humoured and pleasant in his own family , and I do not think him so very ill - looking as I did — at least , one sees many worse . He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund . Of the last - mentioned hero , what shall I say ? If I avoided his name entirely , it would look suspicious . I will say , then , that we have seen him two or three times , and that my friends here are very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance . Mrs. Fraser ( no bad judge ) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a person , height , and air ; and I must confess , when he dined here the other day , there were none to compare with him , and we were a party of sixteen . Luckily there is no distinction of dress nowadays to tell tales , but — but — but Yours affectionately . ”
Fanny Price	“ My Dear Fanny,—Excuse me that I have not written before . Crawford told me that you were wishing to hear from me , but I found it impossible to write from London , and persuaded myself that you would understand my silence . Could I have sent a few happy lines , they should not have been wanting , but nothing of that nature was ever in my power . I am returned to Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it . My hopes are much weaker . You are probably aware of this already . So very fond of you as Miss Crawford is , it is most natural that she should tell you enough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine . I will not be prevented , however , from making my own communication . Our confidences in you need not clash . I ask no questions . There is something soothing in the idea that we have the same friend , and that whatever unhappy differences of opinion may exist between us , we are united in our love of you . It will be a comfort to me to tell you how things now are , and what are my present plans , if plans I can be said to have . I have been returned since Saturday . I was three weeks in London , and saw her ( for London ) very often . I had every attention from the Frasers that could be reasonably expected . I dare say I was not reasonable in carrying with me hopes of an intercourse at all like that of Mansfield . It was her manner , however , rather than any unfrequency of meeting . Had she been different when I did see her , I should have made no complaint , but from the very first she was altered : my first reception was so unlike what I had hoped , that I had almost resolved on leaving London again directly . I need not particularise . You know the weak side of her character , and may imagine the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me . She was in high spirits , and surrounded by those who were giving all the support of their own bad sense to her too lively mind . I do not like Mrs. Fraser . She is a cold - hearted , vain woman , who has married entirely from convenience , and though evidently unhappy in her marriage , places her disappointment not to faults of judgment , or temper , or disproportion of age , but to her being , after all , less affluent than many of her acquaintance , especially than her sister , Lady Stornaway , and is the determined supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious , provided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough . I look upon her intimacy with those two sisters as the greatest misfortune of her life and mine . They have been leading her astray for years . Could she be detached from them!—and sometimes I do not despair of it , for the affection appears to me principally on their side . They are very fond of her ; but I am sure she does not love them as she loves you . When I think of her great attachment to you , indeed , and the whole of her judicious , upright conduct as a sister , she appears a very different creature , capable of everything noble , and I am ready to blame myself for a too harsh construction of a playful manner . I can not give her up , Fanny . She is the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife . If I did not believe that she had some regard for me , of course I should not say this , but I do believe it . I am convinced that she is not without a decided preference . I have no jealousy of any individual . It is the influence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous of . It is the habits of wealth that I fear . Her ideas are not higher than her own fortune may warrant , but they are beyond what our incomes united could authorise . There is comfort , however , even here . I could better bear to lose her because not rich enough , than because of my profession . That would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices , which , in fact , I am scarcely justified in asking ; and , if I am refused , that , I think , will be the honest motive . Her prejudices , I trust , are not so strong as they were . You have my thoughts exactly as they arise , my dear Fanny ; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory , but it will not be a less faithful picture of my mind . Having once begun , it is a pleasure to me to tell you all I feel . I can not give her up . Connected as we already are , and , I hope , are to be , to give up Mary Crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me ; to banish myself from the very houses and friends whom , under any other distress , I should turn to for consolation . The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of Fanny . Were it a decided thing , an actual refusal , I hope I should know how to bear it , and how to endeavour to weaken her hold on my heart , and in the course of a few years — but I am writing nonsense . Were I refused , I must bear it ; and till I am , I can never cease to try for her . This is the truth . The only question is _ how _ ? What may be the likeliest means ? I have sometimes thought of going to London again after Easter , and sometimes resolved on doing nothing till she returns to Mansfield . Even now , she speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield in June ; but June is at a great distance , and I believe I shall write to her . I have nearly determined on explaining myself by letter . To be at an early certainty is a material object . My present state is miserably irksome . Considering everything , I think a letter will be decidedly the best method of explanation . I shall be able to write much that I could not say , and shall be giving her time for reflection before she resolves on her answer , and I am less afraid of the result of reflection than of an immediate hasty impulse ; I think I am . My greatest danger would lie in her consulting Mrs. Fraser , and I at a distance unable to help my own cause . A letter exposes to all the evil of consultation , and where the mind is anything short of perfect decision , an adviser may , in an unlucky moment , lead it to do what it may afterwards regret . I must think this matter over a little . This long letter , full of my own concerns alone , will be enough to tire even the friendship of a Fanny . The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser ’s party . I am more and more satisfied with all that I see and hear of him . There is not a shadow of wavering . He thoroughly knows his own mind , and acts up to his resolutions : an inestimable quality . I could not see him and my eldest sister in the same room without recollecting what you once told me , and I acknowledge that they did not meet as friends . There was marked coolness on her side . They scarcely spoke . I saw him draw back surprised , and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any former supposed slight to Miss Bertram . You will wish to hear my opinion of Maria ’s degree of comfort as a wife . There is no appearance of unhappiness . I hope they get on pretty well together . I dined twice in Wimpole Street , and might have been there oftener , but it is mortifying to be with Rushworth as a brother . Julia seems to enjoy London exceedingly . I had little enjoyment there , but have less here . We are not a lively party . You are very much wanted . I miss you more than I can express . My mother desires her best love , and hopes to hear from you soon . She talks of you almost every hour , and I am sorry to find how many weeks more she is likely to be without you . My father means to fetch you himself , but it will not be till after Easter , when he has business in town . You are happy at Portsmouth , I hope , but this must not be a yearly visit . I want you at home , that I may have your opinion about Thornton Lacey . I have little heart for extensive improvements till I know that it will ever have a mistress . I think I shall certainly write . It is quite settled that the Grants go to Bath ; they leave Mansfield on Monday . I am glad of it . I am not comfortable enough to be fit for anybody ; but your aunt seems to feel out of luck that such an article of Mansfield news should fall to my pen instead of hers.—Yours ever , my dearest Fanny . ”
Fanny Price	“ I never will , no , I certainly never will wish for a letter again , ”
Fanny Price	“ What do they bring but disappointment and sorrow ? Not till after Easter ! How shall I bear it ? And my poor aunt talking of me every hour ! ”
Fanny Price	“ There is no good in this delay , ”
Fanny Price	“ Why is not it settled ? He is blinded , and nothing will open his eyes ; nothing can , after having had truths before him so long in vain . He will marry her , and be poor and miserable . God grant that her influence do not make him cease to be respectable ! ”
Fanny Price	“ ‘ So very fond of me ! ’ ’ tis nonsense all . She loves nobody but herself and her brother . Her friends leading her astray for years ! She is quite as likely to have led _ them _ astray . They have all , perhaps , been corrupting one another ; but if they are so much fonder of her than she is of them , she is the less likely to have been hurt , except by their flattery . ‘ The only woman in the world whom he could ever think of as a wife . ’ I firmly believe it . It is an attachment to govern his whole life . Accepted or refused , his heart is wedded to her for ever . ‘ The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny . ’ Edmund , you do not know me . The families would never be connected if you did not connect them ! Oh ! write , write . Finish it at once . Let there be an end of this suspense . Fix , commit , condemn yourself . ”
Fanny Price	“ He is just come , my dear Fanny , and is taken upstairs ; and I am so shocked to see him , that I do not know what to do . I am sure he has been very ill . Poor Tom ! I am quite grieved for him , and very much frightened , and so is Sir Thomas ; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me . But Sir Thomas hopes he will be better to - morrow , and says we must consider his journey . ”
Fanny Price	“ Forgive me , my dear Fanny , as soon as you can , for my long silence , and behave as if you could forgive me directly . This is my modest request and expectation , for you are so good , that I depend upon being treated better than I deserve , and I write now to beg an immediate answer . I want to know the state of things at Mansfield Park , and you , no doubt , are perfectly able to give it . One should be a brute not to feel for the distress they are in ; and from what I hear , poor Mr. Bertram has a bad chance of ultimate recovery . I thought little of his illness at first . I looked upon him as the sort of person to be made a fuss with , and to make a fuss himself in any trifling disorder , and was chiefly concerned for those who had to nurse him ; but now it is confidently asserted that he is really in a decline , that the symptoms are most alarming , and that part of the family , at least , are aware of it . If it be so , I am sure you must be included in that part , that discerning part , and therefore entreat you to let me know how far I have been rightly informed . I need not say how rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been any mistake , but the report is so prevalent that I confess I can not help trembling . To have such a fine young man cut off in the flower of his days is most melancholy . Poor Sir Thomas will feel it dreadfully . I really am quite agitated on the subject . Fanny , Fanny , I see you smile and look cunning , but , upon my honour , I never bribed a physician in my life . Poor young man ! If he is to die , there will be _ two _ poor young men less in the world ; and with a fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one , that wealth and consequence could fall into no hands more deserving of them . It was a foolish precipitation last Christmas , but the evil of a few days may be blotted out in part . Varnish and gilding hide many stains . It will be but the loss of the Esquire after his name . With real affection , Fanny , like mine , more might be overlooked . Write to me by return of post , judge of my anxiety , and do not trifle with it . Tell me the real truth , as you have it from the fountainhead . And now , do not trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or your own . Believe me , they are not only natural , they are philanthropic and virtuous . I put it to your conscience , whether ‘ Sir Edmund ’ would not do more good with all the Bertram property than any other possible ‘ Sir . ’ Had the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you , but you are now the only one I can apply to for the truth , his sisters not being within my reach . Mrs. R. has been spending the Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham ( as to be sure you know ) , and is not yet returned ; and Julia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square , but I forget their name and street . Could I immediately apply to either , however , I should still prefer you , because it strikes me that they have all along been so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up , as to shut their eyes to the truth . I suppose Mrs. R. ’s Easter holidays will not last much longer ; no doubt they are thorough holidays to her . The Aylmers are pleasant people ; and her husband away , she can have nothing but enjoyment . I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down to Bath , to fetch his mother ; but how will she and the dowager agree in one house ? Henry is not at hand , so I have nothing to say from him . Do not you think Edmund would have been in town again long ago , but for this illness?—Yours ever , Mary . ”
Fanny Price	“ I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in , but he brings no intelligence to prevent my sending it . Mrs. R. knows a decline is apprehended ; he saw her this morning : she returns to Wimpole Street to - day ; the old lady is come . Now do not make yourself uneasy with any queer fancies because he has been spending a few days at Richmond . He does it every spring . Be assured he cares for nobody but you . At this very moment he is wild to see you , and occupied only in contriving the means for doing so , and for making his pleasure conduce to yours . In proof , he repeats , and more eagerly , what he said at Portsmouth about our conveying you home , and I join him in it with all my soul . Dear Fanny , write directly , and tell us to come . It will do us all good . He and I can go to the Parsonage , you know , and be no trouble to our friends at Mansfield Park . It would really be gratifying to see them all again , and a little addition of society might be of infinite use to them ; and as to yourself , you must feel yourself to be so wanted there , that you can not in conscience — conscientious as you are — keep away , when you have the means of returning . I have not time or patience to give half Henry ’s messages ; be satisfied that the spirit of each and every one is unalterable affection . ”
Fanny Price	“ A most scandalous , ill - natured rumour has just reached me , and I write , dear Fanny , to warn you against giving the least credit to it , should it spread into the country . Depend upon it , there is some mistake , and that a day or two will clear it up ; at any rate , that Henry is blameless , and in spite of a moment ’s _ etourderie _ , thinks of nobody but you . Say not a word of it ; hear nothing , surmise nothing , whisper nothing till I write again . I am sure it will be all hushed up , and nothing proved but Rushworth ’s folly . If they are gone , I would lay my life they are only gone to Mansfield Park , and Julia with them . But why would not you let us come for you ? I wish you may not repent it.—Yours , etc . ”
Fanny Price	“ Rushworth , sir . ”
Fanny Price	“ Yes , sir . ”
Fanny Price	“ it was with infinite concern the newspaper had to announce to the world a matrimonial _ fracas _ in the family of Mr. R. of Wimpole Street ; the beautiful Mrs. R. , whose name had not long been enrolled in the lists of Hymen , and who had promised to become so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world , having quitted her husband ’s roof in company with the well - known and captivating Mr. C. , the intimate friend and associate of Mr. R. , and it was not known even to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone . ”
Fanny Price	“ It is a mistake , sir , ”
Fanny Price	“ it must be a mistake , it can not be true ; it must mean some other people . ”
Fanny Price	“ My Fanny , my only sister ; my only comfort now ! ”
Fanny Price	“ No wonder — you must feel it — you must suffer . How a man who had once loved , could desert you ! But _ yours_—your regard was new compared with —— Fanny , think of _ me _ ! ”
Fanny Price	“ And what , ”
Fanny Price	“ what could you say ? ”
Fanny Price	“ Cruel ! ”
Fanny Price	“ quite cruel . At such a moment to give way to gaiety , to speak with lightness , and to you ! Absolute cruelty . ”
Fanny Price	“ Did you ? ”
Fanny Price	“ How long were you together ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ My dear little cousin , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ what can be the matter ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You are sorry to leave Mama , my dear little Fanny , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ which shows you to be a very good girl ; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends , who all love you , and wish to make you happy . Let us walk out in the park , and you shall tell me all about your brothers and sisters . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Fanny was good - natured enough . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Fanny must have a horse ”
Edmund Bertram	company—“If this man had not twelve thousand a year , he would be a very stupid fellow . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I believe I know what you mean , but I will not undertake to answer the question . My cousin is grown up . She has the age and sense of a woman , but the outs and not outs are beyond me . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I believe I have , but this is hardly fair ; I see what you are at . You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Ah ! you carry it off very well , but I can not be quite so far imposed on . You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye , in describing an altered young lady . You paint too accurately for mistake . It was exactly so . The Andersons of Baker Street . We were speaking of them the other day , you know . Edmund , you have heard me mention Charles Anderson . The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it . When Anderson first introduced me to his family , about two years ago , his sister was not _ out _ , and I could not get her to speak to me . I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson , with only her and a little girl or two in the room , the governess being sick or run away , and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business , and I could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady — nothing like a civil answer — she screwed up her mouth , and turned from me with such an air ! I did not see her again for a twelvemonth . She was then _ out _ . I met her at Mrs. Holford ’s , and did not recollect her . She came up to me , claimed me as an acquaintance , stared me out of countenance ; and talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look . I felt that I must be the jest of the room at the time , and Miss Crawford , it is plain , has heard the story . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Those who are showing the world what female manners _ should _ be , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ are doing a great deal to set them right . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Yes , _ that _ is very inconvenient indeed , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ It leads one astray ; one does not know what to do . The close bonnet and demure air you describe so well ( and nothing was ever juster ) , tell one what is expected ; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them . I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September , just after my return from the West Indies . My friend Sneyd — you have heard me speak of Sneyd , Edmund — his father , and mother , and sisters , were there , all new to me . When we reached Albion Place they were out ; we went after them , and found them on the pier : Mrs. and the two Miss Sneyds , with others of their acquaintance . I made my bow in form ; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men , attached myself to one of her daughters , walked by her side all the way home , and made myself as agreeable as I could ; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners , and as ready to talk as to listen . I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong . They looked just the same : both well - dressed , with veils and parasols like other girls ; but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the youngest , who was not _ out _ , and had most excessively offended the eldest . Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months ; and Miss Sneyd , I believe , has never forgiven me . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ That was bad indeed . Poor Miss Sneyd . Though I have no younger sister , I feel for her . To be neglected before one ’s time must be very vexatious ; but it was entirely the mother ’s fault . Miss Augusta should have been with her governess . Such half - and - half doings never prosper . But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price . Does she go to balls ? Does she dine out every where , as well as at my sister ’s ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ No , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I do not think she has ever been to a ball . My mother seldom goes into company herself , and dines nowhere but with Mrs. Grant , and Fanny stays at home with _ her _ . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Oh ! then the point is clear . Miss Price is not out . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ The truth is , that our inquiries were too direct ; we sent a servant , we went ourselves : this will not do seventy miles from London ; but this morning we heard of it in the right way . It was seen by some farmer , and he told the miller , and the miller told the butcher , and the butcher ’s son - in - law left word at the shop . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I am to have it to - morrow ; but how do you think it is to be conveyed ? Not by a wagon or cart : oh no ! nothing of that kind could be hired in the village . I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it ! To want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible , so I told my maid to speak for one directly ; and as I can not look out of my dressing - closet without seeing one farmyard , nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another , I thought it would be only ask and have , and was rather grieved that I could not give the advantage to all . Guess my surprise , when I found that I had been asking the most unreasonable , most impossible thing in the world ; had offended all the farmers , all the labourers , all the hay in the parish ! As for Dr. Grant ’s bailiff , I believe I had better keep out of _ his _ way ; and my brother - in - law himself , who is all kindness in general , looked rather black upon me when he found what I had been at . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I shall understand all your ways in time ; but , coming down with the true London maxim , that everything is to be got with money , I was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs . However , I am to have my harp fetched to - morrow . Henry , who is good - nature itself , has offered to fetch it in his barouche . Will it not be honourably conveyed ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ If I write , I will say whatever you wish me ; but I do not , at present , foresee any occasion for writing . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Miss Price has a brother at sea , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Do you know anything of my cousin ’s captain ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Captain Marshall ? You have a large acquaintance in the navy , I conclude ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ It is a noble profession . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Well , Fanny , and how do you like Miss Crawford _ now _ ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ How did you like her yesterday ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ It is her countenance that is so attractive . She has a wonderful play of feature ! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you , Fanny , as not quite right ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I thought you would be struck . It was very wrong ; very indecorous . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Ungrateful is a strong word . I do not know that her uncle has any claim to her _ gratitude _ ; his wife certainly had ; and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt ’s memory which misleads her here . She is awkwardly circumstanced . With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford , without throwing a shade on the Admiral . I do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements , though the Admiral ’s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife ; but it is natural and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely . I do not censure her _ opinions _ ; but there certainly _ is _ impropriety in making them public . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ That is a fair remark . Yes , we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt ; and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under . But I think her present home must do her good . Mrs. Grant ’s manners are just what they ought to be . She speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ The right of a lively mind , Fanny , seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others ; perfectly allowable , when untinctured by ill - humour or roughness ; and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford : nothing sharp , or loud , or coarse . She is perfectly feminine , except in the instances we have been speaking of . There she can not be justified . I am glad you saw it all as I did . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ For there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner : clouds are now coming up , and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then . I wish _ you _ may not be fatigued by so much exercise . I wish you had saved yourself this walk home . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I do not want her at all for myself , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home , I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time — for a whole morning , in short . She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common : Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views , and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it . But any morning will do for this . She would be extremely sorry to interfere with you . It would be very wrong if she did . _ She _ rides only for pleasure ; _ you _ for health . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ But where is Fanny ? Is she gone to bed ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Fanny , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I am sure you have the headache . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I can hardly believe you , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I know your looks too well . How long have you had it ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Since a little before dinner . It is nothing but the heat . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Did you go out in the heat ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ What ! ”
Edmund Bertram	“ has she been walking as well as cutting roses ; walking across the hot park to your house , and doing it twice , ma’am ? No wonder her head aches . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ And could nobody be employed on such an errand but Fanny ? Upon my word , ma’am , it has been a very ill - managed business . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I wish Fanny had half your strength , ma’am . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ But why is it necessary , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ that Crawford ’s carriage , or his _ only _ , should be employed ? Why is no use to be made of my mother ’s chaise ? I could not , when the scheme was first mentioned the other day , understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ There is no hardship , I suppose , nothing unpleasant , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ in going on the barouche box . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ There can be no objection , then , to Fanny ’s going with you ; there can be no doubt of your having room for her . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ To be sure not , but I _ can not _ do without her . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ _ That _ is hardly Fanny ’s idea of a family assembling , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ If the master and mistress do _ not _ attend themselves , there must be more harm than good in the custom . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects . You have given us an amusing sketch , and human nature can not say it was not so . We must all feel _ at _ _ times _ the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish ; but if you are supposing it a frequent thing , that is to say , a weakness grown into a habit from neglect , what could be expected from the _ private _ devotions of such persons ? Do you think the minds which are suffered , which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel , would be more collected in a closet ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ The mind which does not struggle against itself under _ one _ circumstance , would find objects to distract it in the _ other _ , I believe ; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse better feelings than are begun with . The greater length of the service , however , I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind . One wishes it were not so ; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ A very praiseworthy practice , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ but not quite universal . I am one of the exceptions , and _ being _ one , must do something for myself . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Do you think the church itself never chosen , then ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ The _ nothing _ of conversation has its gradations , I hope , as well as the _ never _ . A clergyman can not be high in state or fashion . He must not head mobs , or set the ton in dress . But I can not call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind , individually or collectively considered , temporally and eternally , which has the guardianship of religion and morals , and consequently of the manners which result from their influence . No one here can call the _ office _ nothing . If the man who holds it is so , it is by the neglect of his duty , by foregoing its just importance , and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ _ You _ are speaking of London , _ I _ am speaking of the nation at large . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Not , I should hope , of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom . We do not look in great cities for our best morality . It is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good ; and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt . A fine preacher is followed and admired ; but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood , where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character , and observing his general conduct , which in London can rarely be the case . The clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners . They are known to the largest part only as preachers . And with regard to their influencing public manners , Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me , or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of good - breeding , the regulators of refinement and courtesy , the masters of the ceremonies of life . The _ manners _ I speak of might rather be called _ conduct _ , perhaps , the result of good principles ; the effect , in short , of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend ; and it will , I believe , be everywhere found , that as the clergy are , or are not what they ought to be , so are the rest of the nation . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Go into the law ! With as much ease as I was told to go into this wilderness . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a _ bon _ _ mot _ , for there is not the least wit in my nature . I am a very matter - of - fact , plain - spoken being , and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ My dear Fanny , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You scarcely touch me , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You do not make me of any use . What a difference in the weight of a woman ’s arm from that of a man ! At Oxford I have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street , and you are only a fly in the comparison . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Not half a mile , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Do you think we are walking four miles an hour ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I am afraid you are very tired , Fanny , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ why would not you speak sooner ? This will be a bad day ’s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up . Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon , Miss Crawford , except riding . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ How abominable in you , then , to let me engross her horse as I did all last week ! I am ashamed of you and of myself , but it shall never happen again . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ _ Your _ attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect . Fanny ’s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ That she should be tired now , however , gives me no surprise ; for there is nothing in the course of one ’s duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning : seeing a great house , dawdling from one room to another , straining one ’s eyes and one ’s attention , hearing what one does not understand , admiring what one does not care for . It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world , and Miss Price has found it so , though she did not know it . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Now , Miss Crawford , if you will look up the walk , you will convince yourself that it can not be half a mile long , or half half a mile . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ There is no sacrifice in the case , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ it is entirely her own doing . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ My taking orders , I assure you , is quite as voluntary as Maria ’s marrying . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Which you suppose has biassed me ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Thank you for your good word , Fanny , but it is more than I would affirm myself . On the contrary , the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me . Nor can I think it wrong that it should . There was no natural disinclination to be overcome , and I see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life . I was in safe hands . I hope I should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way , and I am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it . I have no doubt that I was biased , but I think it was blamelessly . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ No , my dear Miss Price , and for reasons good . The profession , either navy or army , is its own justification . It has everything in its favour : heroism , danger , bustle , fashion . Soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society . Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected , you think ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ To be justified in your eyes , he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ What ! take orders without a living ! No ; that is madness indeed ; absolute madness . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled , if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without ? No ; for you certainly would not know what to say . But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument . As he can not be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession , as heroism , and noise , and fashion , are all against him , he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Oh ! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made , to the trouble of working for one ; and has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat , drink , and grow fat . It is indolence , Mr. Bertram , indeed . Indolence and love of ease ; a want of all laudable ambition , of taste for good company , or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable , which make men clergymen . A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish — read the newspaper , watch the weather , and quarrel with his wife . His curate does all the work , and the business of his own life is to dine . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ There are such clergymen , no doubt , but I think they are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character . I suspect that in this comprehensive and ( may I say ) commonplace censure , you are not judging from yourself , but from prejudiced persons , whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing . It is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy . You can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively . You are speaking what you have been told at your uncle ’s table . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I speak what appears to me the general opinion ; and where an opinion is general , it is usually correct . Though _ I _ have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen , it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Where any one body of educated men , of whatever denomination , are condemned indiscriminately , there must be a deficiency of information , or ( smiling ) of something else . Your uncle , and his brother admirals , perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom , good or bad , they were always wishing away . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Poor William ! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the Antwerp , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I do not wonder at your disapprobation , upon my word . It is a great defect of temper , made worse by a very faulty habit of self - indulgence ; and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours . Fanny , it goes against us . We can not attempt to defend Dr. Grant . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ We can not prove to the contrary , to be sure ; but I wish you a better fate , Miss Price , than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons ; for though he may preach himself into a good - humour every Sunday , it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ must be beyond the reach of any sermons . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ There goes good - humour , I am sure , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ There goes a temper which would never give pain ! How well she walks ! and how readily she falls in with the inclination of others ! joining them the moment she is asked . What a pity , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ that she should have been in such hands ! ”
Edmund Bertram	“ It is to his credit , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ and I dare say it gives his sister pleasure . She does not like his unsettled habits . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Yes , his manners to women are such as must please . Mrs. Grant , I believe , suspects him of a preference for Julia ; I have never seen much symptom of it , but I wish it may be so . He has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Which is , perhaps , more in favour of his liking Julia best , than you , Fanny , may be aware ; for I believe it often happens that a man , before he has quite made up his own mind , will distinguish the sister or intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman herself . Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from Maria ; and I am not at all afraid for her , after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ If you want to dance , Fanny , I will stand up with you . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I am glad of it , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ for I am tired to death . I only wonder how the good people can keep it up so long . They had need be _ all _ in love , to find any amusement in such folly ; and so they are , I fancy . If you look at them you may see they are so many couple of lovers — all but Yates and Mrs. Grant — and , between ourselves , she , poor woman , must want a lover as much as any one of them . A desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ An afterpiece instead of a comedy , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Lovers ’ Vows were at an end , and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother by themselves . Well , the jointure may comfort _ him _ ; and perhaps , between friends , he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the Baron , and was not sorry to withdraw ; and to make _ you _ amends , Yates , I think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield , and ask you to be our manager . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Nay , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Let us do nothing by halves . If we are to act , let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit , boxes , and gallery , and let us have a play entire from beginning to end ; so as it be a German play , no matter what , with a good tricking , shifting afterpiece , and a figure - dance , and a hornpipe , and a song between the acts . If we do not outdo Ecclesford , we do nothing . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ True , to see real acting , good hardened real acting ; but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade : a set of gentlemen and ladies , who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You are not serious , Tom , in meaning to act ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Not serious ! never more so , I assure you . What is there to surprise you in it ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You take up a thing so seriously ! as if we were going to act three times a week till my father ’s return , and invite all the country . But it is not to be a display of that sort . We mean nothing but a little amusement among ourselves , just to vary the scene , and exercise our powers in something new . We want no audience , no publicity . We may be trusted , I think , in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable ; and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own . I have no fears and no scruples . And as to my father ’s being absent , it is so far from an objection , that I consider it rather as a motive ; for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother ; and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety , and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks , I shall think our time very well spent , and so , I am sure , will he . It is a _ very _ anxious period for her . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Oh dear , no , ma’am , nobody suspected you ! Well , Edmund , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I can not agree with you ; I am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ It was a very different thing . You must see the difference yourself . My father wished us , as schoolboys , to speak well , but he would never wish his grown - up daughters to be acting plays . His sense of decorum is strict . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ If you are resolved on acting , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way ; and I think a theatre ought not to be attempted . It would be taking liberties with my father ’s house in his absence which could not be justified . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ The innovation , if not wrong as an innovation , will be wrong as an expense . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ No , as to acting myself , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ _ that _ I absolutely protest against . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Lovers ’ Vows ! ”
Edmund Bertram	“ But what do you do for women ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up , with _ us _ , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up . I can not but suppose you _ will _ when you have read it carefully over . Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt , and see how you can approve it . It will not be necessary to send you to your _ father ’s _ judgment , I am convinced . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I am convinced , madam , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ that Sir Thomas would not like it . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ What ! ”
Edmund Bertram	“ if she knew your reasons ! ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Do not urge her , madam , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ It is not fair to urge her in this manner . You see she does not like to act . Let her chuse for herself , as well as the rest of us . Her judgment may be quite as safely trusted . Do not urge her any more . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ the Mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Can I speak with you , Fanny , for a few minutes ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I shall walk down immediately after breakfast , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Do , Fanny , if it is not _ very _ disagreeable to you . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Something must be done , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Perhaps I might have scolded , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ if either of you had been sitting down alone ; but while you do wrong together , I can overlook a great deal . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ And really , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ the day is so mild , that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent . Our weather must not always be judged by the calendar . We may sometimes take greater liberties in November than in May . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Do not flatter yourself , my dearest Mary . You have not the smallest chance of moving me . I have my alarms , but they are quite in a different quarter ; and if I could have altered the weather , you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time — for here are some of my plants which Robert _ will _ leave out because the nights are so mild , and I know the end of it will be , that we shall have a sudden change of weather , a hard frost setting in all at once , taking everybody ( at least Robert ) by surprise , and I shall lose every one ; and what is worse , cook has just been telling me that the turkey , which I particularly wished not to be dressed till Sunday , because I know how much more Dr. Grant would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day , will not keep beyond to - morrow . These are something like grievances , and make me think the weather most unseasonably close . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ My dear child , commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St. Paul ’s , and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be . But we have no such people in Mansfield . What would you have me do ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Thank you ; but there is no escaping these little vexations , Mary , live where we may ; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you , I dare say I shall find you with yours , in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer , perhaps on their very account . Their remoteness and unpunctuality , or their exorbitant charges and frauds , will be drawing forth bitter lamentations . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You intend to be very rich ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ If you put such a question to her , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Fanny will immediately say No ; but I am sure , my dear mother , she would like to go ; and I can see no reason why she should not . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ But is it not very natural , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ But can I do without her , Sir Thomas ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ She always makes tea , you know , when my sister is not here . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Very well , then , Fanny may go , Edmund . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Well , Fanny , it is all happily settled , and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle ’s side . He had but one opinion . You are to go . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Now I must look at you , Fanny , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ and tell you how I like you ; and as well as I can judge by this light , you look very nicely indeed . What have you got on ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white . No , I see no finery about you ; nothing but what is perfectly proper . Your gown seems very pretty . I like these glossy spots . Has not Miss Crawford a gown something the same ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Heyday ! ”
Edmund Bertram	“ here ’s company , here ’s a carriage ! who have they got to meet us ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ ’ Tis Crawford ’s , Crawford ’s barouche , I protest ! There are his own two men pushing it back into its old quarters . He is here , of course . This is quite a surprise , Fanny . I shall be very glad to see him . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I shall keep clear of you , Crawford , as long as I can , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ for you would be more likely to disconcert me , and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ It sounds like it , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ but which way did you turn after passing Sewell ’s farm ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You inquired , then ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You have a good memory . I had forgotten having ever told you half so much of the place . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Well , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ and how did you like what you saw ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Very much indeed . You are a lucky fellow . There will be work for five summers at least before the place is liveable . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ No , no , not so bad as that . The farmyard must be moved , I grant you ; but I am not aware of anything else . The house is by no means bad , and when the yard is removed , there may be a very tolerable approach to it . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ The farmyard must be cleared away entirely , and planted up to shut out the blacksmith ’s shop . The house must be turned to front the east instead of the north — the entrance and principal rooms , I mean , must be on that side , where the view is really very pretty ; I am sure it may be done . And _ there _ must be your approach , through what is at present the garden . You must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house ; which will be giving it the best aspect in the world , sloping to the south - east . The ground seems precisely formed for it . I rode fifty yards up the lane , between the church and the house , in order to look about me ; and saw how it might all be . Nothing can be easier . The meadows beyond what _ will _ _ be _ the garden , as well as what now _ is _ , sweeping round from the lane I stood in to the north - east , that is , to the principal road through the village , must be all laid together , of course ; very pretty meadows they are , finely sprinkled with timber . They belong to the living , I suppose ; if not , you must purchase them . Then the stream — something must be done with the stream ; but I could not quite determine what . I had two or three ideas . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ And I have two or three ideas also , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ and one of them is , that very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in practice . I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty . I think the house and premises may be made comfortable , and given the air of a gentleman ’s residence , without any very heavy expense , and that must suffice me ; and , I hope , may suffice all who care about me . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ The air of a gentleman ’s residence , therefore , you can not but give it , if you do anything . But it is capable of much more . ( Let me see , Mary ; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for that queen ; no , no , a dozen is more than it is worth . Lady Bertram does not bid a dozen . She will have nothing to say to it . Go on , go on . ) By some such improvements as I have suggested ( I do not really require you to proceed upon my plan , though , by the bye , I doubt anybody ’s striking out a better ) you may give it a higher character . You may raise it into a _ place _ . From being the mere gentleman ’s residence , it becomes , by judicious improvement , the residence of a man of education , taste , modern manners , good connexions . All this may be stamped on it ; and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road ; especially as there is no real squire ’s house to dispute the point — a circumstance , between ourselves , to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation . _ You _ think with me , I hope ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Have you ever seen the place ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ And Fanny had much rather it were William ’s , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Poor Fanny ! not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes ! ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Sir Thomas , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish priest . We must hope his son may prove that _ he _ knows it too . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ yes ”
Edmund Bertram	“ But what is it that you want to consult me about ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ My very dear Fanny , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Fanny , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You look tired and fagged , Fanny . You have been walking too far . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ No , I have not been out at all . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Then you have had fatigues within doors , which are worse . You had better have gone out . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I come from Dr. Grant ’s , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You may guess my errand there , Fanny . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I wished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Yes , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ she is engaged to me ; but ”
Edmund Bertram	“ she says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me . She is not serious . I think , I hope , I am sure she is not serious ; but I would rather not hear it . She never has danced with a clergyman , she says , and she never _ will _ . For my own sake , I could wish there had been no ball just at — I mean not this very week , this very day ; to - morrow I leave home . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Yes , that uncle and aunt ! They have injured the finest mind ; for sometimes , Fanny , I own to you , it does appear more than manner : it appears as if the mind itself was tainted . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Dearest Fanny ! ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You must dance with me , Fanny ; you must keep two dances for me ; any two that you like , except the first . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I am worn out with civility , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I have been talking incessantly all night , and with nothing to say . But with _ you _ , Fanny , there may be peace . You will not want to be talked to . Let us have the luxury of silence . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ That play must be a favourite with you , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ you read as if you knew it well . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ from one ’s earliest years . His celebrated passages are quoted by everybody ; they are in half the books we open , and we all talk Shakespeare , use his similes , and describe with his descriptions ; but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it . To know him in bits and scraps is common enough ; to know him pretty thoroughly is , perhaps , not uncommon ; but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Even in my profession , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ how little the art of reading has been studied ! how little a clear manner , and good delivery , have been attended to ! I speak rather of the past , however , than the present . There is now a spirit of improvement abroad ; but among those who were ordained twenty , thirty , forty years ago , the larger number , to judge by their performance , must have thought reading was reading , and preaching was preaching . It is different now . The subject is more justly considered . It is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths ; and besides , there is more general observation and taste , a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly ; in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter , and who can judge and criticise . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I should indeed . I never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy . But then , I must have a London audience . I could not preach but to the educated ; to those who were capable of estimating my composition . And I do not know that I should be fond of preaching often ; now and then , perhaps once or twice in the spring , after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together ; but not for a constancy ; it would not do for a constancy . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ To Parents and Guardians ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Capital season’d Hunter . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I will speak to her , sir : I will take the first opportunity of speaking to her alone , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I am come to walk with you , Fanny , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Shall I ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ It is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk together . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ But , Fanny , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ in order to have a comfortable walk , something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together . You must talk to me . I know you have something on your mind . I know what you are thinking of . You can not suppose me uninformed . Am I to hear of it from everybody but Fanny herself ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Not of facts , perhaps ; but of feelings , Fanny . No one but you can tell me them . I do not mean to press you , however . If it is not what you wish yourself , I have done . I had thought it might be a relief . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Do you suppose that we think differently ? I have no idea of it . I dare say that , on a comparison of our opinions , they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be : to the point — I consider Crawford ’s proposals as most advantageous and desirable , if you could return his affection . I consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it ; but that , as you can not , you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him . Can there be any disagreement between us here ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ This comfort you might have had sooner , Fanny , had you sought it . But how could you possibly suppose me against you ? How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love ? Were I even careless in general on such matters , how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ As far as you have gone , Fanny , I think you perfectly right . I may be sorry , I may be surprised — though hardly _ that _ , for you had not had time to attach yourself — but I think you perfectly right . Can it admit of a question ? It is disgraceful to us if it does . You did not love him ; nothing could have justified your accepting him . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Never ! Fanny!—so very determined and positive ! This is not like yourself , your rational self . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I must hope better things . I am aware , more aware than Crawford can be , that the man who means to make you love him ( you having due notice of his intentions ) must have very uphill work , for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array ; and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate , which so many years ’ growth have confirmed , and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation . I know that the apprehension of being forced to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you against him . I wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for . I wish he had known you as well as I do , Fanny . Between us , I think we should have won you . My theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed . He should have worked upon my plans . I must hope , however , that time , proving him ( as I firmly believe it will ) to deserve you by his steady affection , will give him his reward . I can not suppose that you have not the _ wish _ to love him — the natural wish of gratitude . You must have some feeling of that sort . You must be sorry for your own indifference . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ My dear Fanny , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ let us not , any of us , be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly . The time of the play is a time which I hate to recollect . Maria was wrong , Crawford was wrong , we were all wrong together ; but none so wrong as myself . Compared with me , all the rest were blameless . I was playing the fool with my eyes open . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Very possibly . No wonder . Nothing could be more improper than the whole business . I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of it ; but , if she could undertake the part , we must not be surprised at the rest . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Julia ! I have heard before from some one of his being in love with Julia ; but I could never see anything of it . And , Fanny , though I hope I do justice to my sisters ’ good qualities , I think it very possible that they might , one or both , be more desirous of being admired by Crawford , and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent . I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society ; and with such encouragement , a man like Crawford , lively , and it may be , a little unthinking , might be led on to — there could be nothing very striking , because it is clear that he had no pretensions : his heart was reserved for you . And I must say , that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion . It does him the highest honour ; it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment . It proves him unspoilt by his uncle . It proves him , in short , everything that I had been used to wish to believe him , and feared he was not . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Say , rather , that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects , which I believe to be a good deal the case . How could it be otherwise , with such an education and adviser ? Under the disadvantages , indeed , which both have had , is it not wonderful that they should be what they are ? Crawford ’s _ feelings _ , I am ready to acknowledge , have hitherto been too much his guides . Happily , those feelings have generally been good . You will supply the rest ; and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature — to a woman who , firm as a rock in her own principles , has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them . He has chosen his partner , indeed , with rare felicity . He will make you happy , Fanny ; I know he will make you happy ; but you will make him everything . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ As usual , believing yourself unequal to anything ! fancying everything too much for you ! Well , though I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings , you will be persuaded into them , I trust . I confess myself sincerely anxious that you may . I have no common interest in Crawford ’s well - doing . Next to your happiness , Fanny , his has the first claim on me . You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday , particularly pleased , because I had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light . I knew she was very fond of you ; but yet I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved , and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune . I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims , which she has been too much used to hear . But it was very different . She spoke of you , Fanny , just as she ought . She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself . We had a long talk about it . I should not have mentioned the subject , though very anxious to know her sentiments ; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart , and sweet peculiarity of manner , that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself . Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Yes , when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Yes , she laments it ; yet owns it may have been best . You will see her , however , before she goes . She is very angry with you , Fanny ; you must be prepared for that . She calls herself very angry , but you can imagine her anger . It is the regret and disappointment of a sister , who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for , at the first moment . She is hurt , as you would be for William ; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ My dearest Fanny , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ do not let the idea of her anger distress you . It is anger to be talked of rather than felt . Her heart is made for love and kindness , not for resentment . I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise ; I wish you could have seen her countenance , when she said that you _ should _ be Henry ’s wife . And I observed that she always spoke of you as ‘ Fanny , ’ which she was never used to do ; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Yes , she was agreeing exactly with her sister . The surprise of your refusal , Fanny , seems to have been unbounded . That you could refuse such a man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand . I said what I could for you ; but in good truth , as they stated the case — you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct ; nothing else will satisfy them . But this is teasing you . I have done . Do not turn away from me . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ My dear , dear Fanny , now I have the truth . I know this to be the truth ; and most worthy of you are such feelings . I had attributed them to you before . I thought I could understand you . You have now given exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant , and they were both better satisfied , though your warm - hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry . I told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least ; and that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford ’s addresses was against him . Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour ; that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to ; and a great deal more to the same purpose , to give them a knowledge of your character . Miss Crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother . She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time , and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years ’ happy marriage . ”
Edmund Bertram	observed—“They go on Monday . You are sure , therefore , of seeing your friend either to - morrow or Sunday . They really go on Monday ; and I was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day ! I had almost promised it . What a difference it might have made ! Those five or six days more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You were near staying there ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Very . I was most kindly pressed , and had nearly consented . Had I received any letter from Mansfield , to tell me how you were all going on , I believe I should certainly have staid ; but I knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight , and felt that I had been away long enough . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ You spent your time pleasantly there ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Yes ; that is , it was the fault of my own mind if I did not . They were all very pleasant . I doubt their finding me so . I took uneasiness with me , and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ The Miss Owens — you liked them , did not you ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Yes , very well . Pleasant , good - humoured , unaffected girls . But I am spoilt , Fanny , for common female society . Good - humoured , unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women . They are two distinct orders of being . You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ her friend , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ And _ I _ shall write to you , Fanny , when I have anything worth writing about , anything to say that I think you will like to hear , and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ On the subject of my last , I had actually begun a letter when called away by Tom ’s illness , but I have now changed my mind , and fear to trust the influence of friends . When Tom is better , I shall go . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Dear Fanny,—You know our present wretchedness . May God support you under your share ! We have been here two days , but there is nothing to be done . They can not be traced . You may not have heard of the last blow — Julia ’s elopement ; she is gone to Scotland with Yates . She left London a few hours before we entered it . At any other time this would have been felt dreadfully . Now it seems nothing ; yet it is an heavy aggravation . My father is not overpowered . More can not be hoped . He is still able to think and act ; and I write , by his desire , to propose your returning home . He is anxious to get you there for my mother ’s sake . I shall be at Portsmouth the morning after you receive this , and hope to find you ready to set off for Mansfield . My father wishes you to invite Susan to go with you for a few months . Settle it as you like ; say what is proper ; I am sure you will feel such an instance of his kindness at such a moment ! Do justice to his meaning , however I may confuse it . You may imagine something of my present state . There is no end of the evil let loose upon us . You will see me early by the mail.—Yours , etc . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Have you breakfasted ? When shall you be ready ? Does Susan go ? ”
Edmund Bertram	“ Now , Fanny , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ I shall soon have done . I have told you the substance of all that she said . As soon as I could speak , I replied that I had not supposed it possible , coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done , that anything could occur to make me suffer more , but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence . That though I had , in the course of our acquaintance , been often sensible of some difference in our opinions , on points , too , of some moment , it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it . That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister ( with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say ) , but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself , giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past . That , perhaps , it was best for me ; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship , feelings , hopes which must , at any rate , have been torn from me now . And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem . This is what I said , the purport of it ; but , as you may imagine , not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you . She was astonished , exceedingly astonished — more than astonished . I saw her change countenance . She turned extremely red . I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings : a great , though short struggle ; half a wish of yielding to truths , half a sense of shame , but habit , habit carried it . She would have laughed if she could . It was a sort of laugh , as she answered , ‘ A pretty good lecture , upon my word . Was it part of your last sermon ? At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey ; and when I hear of you next , it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists , or as a missionary into foreign parts . ’ She tried to speak carelessly , but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear . I only said in reply , that from my heart I wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room . I had gone a few steps , Fanny , when I heard the door open behind me . ‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she . I looked back . ‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she , with a smile ; but it was a smile ill - suited to the conversation that had passed , a saucy playful smile , seeming to invite in order to subdue me ; at least it appeared so to me . I resisted ; it was the impulse of the moment to resist , and still walked on . I have since , sometimes , for a moment , regretted that I did not go back , but I know I was right , and such has been the end of our acquaintance . And what an acquaintance has it been ! How have I been deceived ! Equally in brother and sister deceived ! I thank you for your patience , Fanny . This has been the greatest relief , and now we will have done . ”
Edmund Bertram	“ But they , ”
Edmund Bertram	“ have a claim . They seem to belong to us ; they seem to be part of ourselves . I could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away . I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected . But the truth is , that my father hardly knows them . They had not been here a twelvemonth when he left England . If he knew them better , he would value their society as it deserves ; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like . We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves : my sisters seem out of spirits , and Tom is certainly not at his ease . Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us , and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ There is a great deal of truth in what you say , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each . I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in , and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price , and creditable to ourselves , we must secure to the child , or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter , as circumstances may arise , the provision of a gentlewoman , if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Yes , let her home be in this house . We will endeavour to do our duty by her , and she will , at least , have the advantage of companions of her own age , and of a regular instructress . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Should her disposition be really bad , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ we must not , for our own children ’s sake , continue her in the family ; but there is no reason to expect so great an evil . We shall probably see much to wish altered in her , and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance , some meanness of opinions , and very distressing vulgarity of manner ; but these are not incurable faults ; nor , I trust , can they be dangerous for her associates . Had my daughters been _ younger _ than herself , I should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment ; but , as it is , I hope there can be nothing to fear for _ them _ , and everything to hope for _ her _ , from the association . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ There will be some difficulty in our way , Mrs. Norris , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up : how to preserve in the minds of my _ daughters _ the consciousness of what they are , without making them think too lowly of their cousin ; and how , without depressing her spirits too far , to make her remember that she is not a _ Miss Bertram _ . I should wish to see them very good friends , and would , on no account , authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation ; but still they can not be equals . Their rank , fortune , rights , and expectations will always be different . It is a point of great delicacy , and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I blush for you , Tom , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I blush for the expedient which I am driven on , and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion . You have robbed Edmund for ten , twenty , thirty years , perhaps for life , of more than half the income which ought to be his . It may hereafter be in my power , or in yours ( I hope it will ) , to procure him better preferment ; but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us , and that nothing can , in fact , be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Sir Thomas , who had done so much for her and her brothers , and who was gone perhaps never to return ! that she should see him go without a tear ! it was a shameful insensibility . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ This was so thoughtful and kind ! ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ my dear Fanny , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ If William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ We must have a curtain , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ a few yards of green baize for a curtain , and perhaps that may be enough . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ By Jove ! this wo n’t do , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ To be sure , my dear mother , your anxiety — I was unlucky there . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I know all that , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I know my father as well as you do ; and I ’ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him . Manage your own concerns , Edmund , and I ’ll take care of the rest of the family . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ For everything of that nature I will be answerable , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ His house shall not be hurt . I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have ; and as to such alterations as I was suggesting just now , such as moving a bookcase , or unlocking a door , or even as using the billiard - room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it , you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room , and less in the breakfast - room , than we did before he went away , or to my sister ’s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other . Absolute nonsense ! ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Yes , the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious ! Perhaps it might cost a whole twenty pounds . Something of a theatre we must have undoubtedly , but it will be on the simplest plan : a green curtain and a little carpenter ’s work , and that ’s all ; and as the carpenter ’s work may be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself , it will be too absurd to talk of expense ; and as long as Jackson is employed , everything will be right with Sir Thomas . Do n’t imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge but yourself . Do n’t act yourself , if you do not like it , but do n’t expect to govern everybody else . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ This will never do , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ We are wasting time most abominably . Something must be fixed on . No matter what , so that something is chosen . We must not be so nice . A few characters too many must not frighten us . We must _ double _ them . We must descend a little . If a part is insignificant , the greater our credit in making anything of it . From this moment I make no difficulties . I take any part you chuse to give me , so as it be comic . Let it but be comic , I condition for nothing more . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ It falls as naturally , as necessarily to her , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters . It can be no sacrifice on their side , for it is highly comic . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I must entreat Miss _ Julia _ Bertram , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ not to engage in the part of Agatha , or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity . You must not , indeed you must not ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness . The many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me , and Frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run away . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Miss Crawford must be Amelia . She will be an excellent Amelia . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I should be but too happy in taking the part , if it were possible , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ but , unluckily , the Butler and Anhalt are in together . I will not entirely give it up , however ; I will try what can be done — I will look it over again . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ _ I _ shall not ask him , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Fanny , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ we want your services . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Oh ! we do not want to disturb you from your seat . We do not want your _ present _ services . We shall only want you in our play . You must be Cottager ’s wife . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Indeed , but you must , for we can not excuse you . It need not frighten you : it is a nothing of a part , a mere nothing , not above half a dozen speeches altogether , and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say ; so you may be as creep - mouse as you like , but we must have you to look at . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Yes , yes , you can act well enough for _ us _ . Learn your part , and we will teach you all the rest . You have only two scenes , and as I shall be Cottager , I ’ll put you in and push you about , and you will do it very well , I ’ll answer for it . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Phoo ! Phoo ! Do not be so shamefaced . You ’ll do it very well . Every allowance will be made for you . We do not expect perfection . You must get a brown gown , and a white apron , and a mob cap , and we must make you a few wrinkles , and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes , and you will be a very proper , little old woman . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ But there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling it , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ We have but to speak the word ; we may pick and chuse . I could name , at this moment , at least six young men within six miles of us , who are wild to be admitted into our company , and there are one or two that would not disgrace us : I should not be afraid to trust either of the Olivers or Charles Maddox . Tom Oliver is a very clever fellow , and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere , so I will take my horse early to - morrow morning and ride over to Stoke , and settle with one of them . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Perhaps , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now . Perhaps you may persuade _ her _ . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ No , she is quite determined . She certainly will not act . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Oh ! very well . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth ’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ But where is Fanny ? Why do not I see my little Fanny?”—and
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Still the same anxiety for everybody ’s comfort , my dear Mrs. Norris , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ But indeed I would rather have nothing but tea . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ The _ all _ will soon be told , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now . You will hear enough of it to - morrow , sir . We have just been trying , by way of doing something , and amusing my mother , just within the last week , to get up a few scenes , a mere trifle . We have had such incessant rains almost since October began , that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together . I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd . Tolerable sport the first three days , but there has been no attempting anything since . The first day I went over Mansfield Wood , and Edmund took the copses beyond Easton , and we brought home six brace between us , and might each have killed six times as many , but we respect your pheasants , sir , I assure you , as much as you could desire . I do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were . _ I _ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year . I hope you will take a day ’s sport there yourself , sir , soon . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Then poor Yates is all alone , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I will go and fetch him . He will be no bad assistant when it all comes out . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I come from your theatre , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I found myself in it rather unexpectedly . Its vicinity to my own room — but in every respect , indeed , it took me by surprise , as I had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character . It appears a neat job , however , as far as I could judge by candlelight , and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ This was , in fact , the origin of _ our _ acting , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ My friend Yates brought the infection from Ecclesford , and it spread — as those things always spread , you know , sir — the faster , probably , from _ your _ having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly . It was like treading old ground again . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ My indulgence shall be given , sir , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ but without any other rehearsal . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I come home to be happy and indulgent . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Mr. and Miss Crawford were mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield . Do you find them agreeable acquaintance ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Mr. Crawford was a most pleasant , gentleman - like man ; his sister a sweet , pretty , elegant , lively girl . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same . It gives me sincere satisfaction . That I should be cautious and quick - sighted , and feel many scruples which my children do _ not _ feel , is perfectly natural ; and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity , for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures , should much exceed theirs . But at your time of life to feel all this , is a most favourable circumstance for yourself , and for everybody connected with you ; and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ We have all been more or less to blame , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ every one of us , excepting Fanny . Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout ; who has been consistent . _ Her _ feelings have been steadily against it from first to last . She never ceased to think of what was due to you . You will find Fanny everything you could wish . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ From Bath , Norfolk , London , York , wherever I may be , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I will attend you from any place in England , at an hour ’s notice . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I am sorry you are going ; but as to our play , _ that _ is all over — entirely at an end ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ The painter was sent off yesterday , and very little will remain of the theatre to - morrow . I knew how _ that _ would be from the first . It is early for Bath . You will find nobody there . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ It is about my uncle ’s usual time . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ When do you think of going ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I may , perhaps , get as far as Banbury to - day . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Whose stables do you use at Bath ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Well , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ She will be late , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ but what is your difficulty ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Nothing can be more natural , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ nor , were there no sister in the case , could anything , in my opinion , be more natural . Mrs. Grant ’s shewing civility to Miss Price , to Lady Bertram ’s niece , could never want explanation . The only surprise I can feel is , that this should be the _ first _ time of its being paid . Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer . She appears to feel as she ought . But as I conclude that she must wish to go , since all young people like to be together , I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Indeed I think you may . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Your sister , perhaps , may be prevailed on to spend the day with us , and I shall certainly be at home . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Fanny , at what time would you have the carriage come round ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Walk ! ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ My niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year ! Will twenty minutes after four suit you ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ What shall I do , Sir Thomas ? Whist and speculation ; which will amuse me most ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I do not advise your going to Brighton , William , as I trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting ; but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere ; and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ It is the only way , sir , in which I could _ not _ wish you established as a permanent neighbour ; but I hope , and believe , that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton Lacey . Edmund , am I saying too much ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ We shall be the losers , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ His going , though only eight miles , will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle ; but I should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile himself to doing less . It is perfectly natural that you should not have thought much on the subject , Mr. Crawford . But a parish has wants and claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident , and which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent . Edmund might , in the common phrase , do the duty of Thornton , that is , he might read prayers and preach , without giving up Mansfield Park : he might ride over every Sunday , to a house nominally inhabited , and go through divine service ; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day , for three or four hours , if that would content him . But it will not . He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey ; and that if he does not live among his parishioners , and prove himself , by constant attention , their well - wisher and friend , he does very little either for their good or his own . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I repeat again , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ that Thornton Lacey is the only house in the neighbourhood in which I should _ not _ be happy to wait on Mr. Crawford as occupier . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ My daughters , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ have their pleasures at Brighton , and I hope are very happy ; but the dance which I think of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins . Could we be all assembled , our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete , but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Yes , sir ; to Mr. Crawford , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ It must be so , my dear , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ So soon ! my good friend , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ it is three o’clock , and your sister is not used to these sort of hours . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Oh ! William . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ We miss our two young men , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ And there is no reason to suppose , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent . As to Edmund , we must learn to do without him . This will be the last winter of his belonging to us , as he has done . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Very true . We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face , she is now a very valuable companion . If we have been kind to _ her _ , she is now quite as necessary to _ us _ . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ She will never leave us , I hope , till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ And _ that _ is not very likely to be , Sir Thomas . Who should invite her ? Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ And now , Fanny , having performed one part of my commission , and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory , I may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs , where , though I can not but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself , I must submit to your finding one still better worth listening to . Mr. Crawford , as you have perhaps foreseen , is yet in the house . He is in my room , and hoping to see you there . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	exclaim—“Oh ! no , sir , I can not , indeed I can not go down to him . Mr. Crawford ought to know — he must know that : I told him enough yesterday to convince him ; he spoke to me on this subject yesterday , and I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me , and quite out of my power to return his good opinion . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I do not catch your meaning , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Out of your power to return his good opinion ? What is all this ? I know he spoke to you yesterday , and ( as far as I understand ) received as much encouragement to proceed as a well - judging young woman could permit herself to give . I was very much pleased with what I collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion ; it shewed a discretion highly to be commended . But now , when he has made his overtures so properly , and honourably — what are your scruples _ now _ ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Am I to understand , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ that you mean to _ refuse _ Mr. Crawford ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Yes , sir . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Refuse him ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Yes , sir . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Refuse Mr. Crawford ! Upon what plea ? For what reason ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I — I can not like him , sir , well enough to marry him . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ This is very strange ! ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ There is something in this which my comprehension does not reach . Here is a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you , with everything to recommend him : not merely situation in life , fortune , and character , but with more than common agreeableness , with address and conversation pleasing to everybody . And he is not an acquaintance of to - day ; you have now known him some time . His sister , moreover , is your intimate friend , and he has been doing _ that _ for your brother , which I should suppose would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you , had there been no other . It is very uncertain when my interest might have got William on . He has done it already . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ You must have been aware , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ you must have been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford ’s manners to you . This can not have taken you by surprise . You must have observed his attentions ; and though you always received them very properly ( I have no accusation to make on that head ) , I never perceived them to be unpleasant to you . I am half inclined to think , Fanny , that you do not quite know your own feelings . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Oh yes , sir ! indeed I do . His attentions were always — what I did not like . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ This is beyond me , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ This requires explanation . Young as you are , and having seen scarcely any one , it is hardly possible that your affections — ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ No , no , I know _ that _ is quite out of the question ; quite impossible . Well , there is nothing more to be said . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford ’s _ choice _ seemed to justify ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ his wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me . I am an advocate for early marriages , where there are means in proportion , and would have every young man , with a sufficient income , settle as soon after four - and - twenty as he can . This is so much my opinion , that I am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son , your cousin , Mr. Bertram , is to marry early ; but at present , as far as I can judge , matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts . I wish he were more likely to fix . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Edmund , I consider , from his dispositions and habits , as much more likely to marry early than his brother . _ He _ , indeed , I have lately thought , has seen the woman he could love , which , I am convinced , my eldest son has not . Am I right ? Do you agree with me , my dear ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Yes , sir . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Have you any reason , child , to think ill of Mr. Crawford ’s temper ? ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ No , sir . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ But of his principles I have ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ It is of no use , I perceive , to talk to you . We had better put an end to this most mortifying conference . Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer waiting . I will , therefore , only add , as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct , that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed , and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what I had supposed . For I _ had _ , Fanny , as I think my behaviour must have shewn , formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to England . I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper , self - conceit , and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much in modern days , even in young women , and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence . But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse ; that you can and will decide for yourself , without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you , without even asking their advice . You have shewn yourself very , very different from anything that I had imagined . The advantage or disadvantage of your family , of your parents , your brothers and sisters , never seems to have had a moment ’s share in your thoughts on this occasion . How _ they _ might be benefited , how _ they _ must rejoice in such an establishment for you , is nothing to _ you _ . You think only of yourself , and because you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness , you resolve to refuse him at once , without wishing even for a little time to consider of it , a little more time for cool consideration , and for really examining your own inclinations ; and are , in a wild fit of folly , throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life , eligibly , honourably , nobly settled , as will , probably , never occur to you again . Here is a young man of sense , of character , of temper , of manners , and of fortune , exceedingly attached to you , and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way ; and let me tell you , Fanny , that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford ’s estate , or a tenth part of his merits . Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him . Maria is nobly married ; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia ’s hand , I should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria ’s to Mr. Rushworth . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ And I should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters , on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only _ half _ the eligibility of _ this _ , immediately and peremptorily , and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation , put a decided negative on it . I should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding . I should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect . _ You _ are not to be judged by the same rule . You do not owe me the duty of a child . But , Fanny , if your heart can acquit you of _ ingratitude _ — ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Well , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ well , child , dry up your tears . There is no use in these tears ; they can do no good . You must now come downstairs with me . Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting too long already . You must give him your own answer : we can not expect him to be satisfied with less ; and you only can explain to him the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments , which , unfortunately for himself , he certainly has imbibed . I am totally unequal to it . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ Well , Fanny , I have seen Mr. Crawford again , and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you . He is a most extraordinary young man , and whatever be the event , you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common character ; though , young as you are , and little acquainted with the transient , varying , unsteady nature of love , as it generally exists , you can not be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against discouragement . With him it is entirely a matter of feeling : he claims no merit in it ; perhaps is entitled to none . Yet , having chosen so well , his constancy has a respectable stamp . Had his choice been less unexceptionable , I should have condemned his persevering . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ My dear , ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ there is no occasion for this . Your feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you . There is nothing more to be said or done . From this hour the subject is never to be revived between us . You will have nothing to fear , or to be agitated about . You can not suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations . Your happiness and advantage are all that I have in view , and nothing is required of you but to bear with Mr. Crawford ’s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his . He proceeds at his own risk . You are on safe ground . I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls , as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred . You will see him with the rest of us , in the same manner , and , as much as you can , dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant . He leaves Northamptonshire so soon , that even this slight sacrifice can not be often demanded . The future must be very uncertain . And now , my dear Fanny , this subject is closed between us . ”
Sir Thomas Bertram	“ then so it shall be ”
Mary Crawford	“ I begin now to understand you all , except Miss Price , ”
Mary Crawford	“ Pray , is she out , or is she not ? I am puzzled . She dined at the Parsonage , with the rest of you , which seemed like being _ out _ ; and yet she says so little , that I can hardly suppose she _ is _ . ”
Mary Crawford	“ And yet , in general , nothing can be more easily ascertained . The distinction is so broad . Manners as well as appearance are , generally speaking , so totally different . Till now , I could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl ’s being out or not . A girl not out has always the same sort of dress : a close bonnet , for instance ; looks very demure , and never says a word . You may smile , but it is so , I assure you ; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far , it is all very proper . Girls should be quiet and modest . The most objectionable part is , that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden . They sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite — to confidence ! _ That _ is the faulty part of the present system . One does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing — and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before . Mr. Bertram , I dare say _ you _ have sometimes met with such changes . ”
Mary Crawford	“ No , indeed . Miss Anderson ! I do not know who or what you mean . I am quite in the dark . But I _ will _ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure , if you will tell me what about . ”
Mary Crawford	“ And a very pretty story it is , and with more truth in it , I dare say , than does credit to Miss Anderson . It is too common a fault . Mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters . I do not know where the error lies . I do not pretend to set people right , but I do see that they are often wrong . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I do not know , ”
Mary Crawford	“ Yes , I can not agree with you there . It is certainly the modestest part of the business . It is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were , which I have seen done . That is worse than anything — quite disgusting ! ”
Mary Crawford	“ my friend such a one . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I collect , ”
Mary Crawford	“ that Sotherton is an old place , and a place of some grandeur . In any particular style of building ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ He is a well - bred man ; he makes the best of it . ”
Mary Crawford	“ _ You _ would know what you were about , of course ; but that would not suit _ me _ . I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters , but as they are before me ; and had I a place of my own in the country , I should be most thankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it , and give me as much beauty as he could for my money ; and I should never look at it till it was complete . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Mr. Bertram , ”
Mary Crawford	“ I have tidings of my harp at last . I am assured that it is safe at Northampton ; and there it has probably been these ten days , in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the contrary . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I am very glad that you have heard of it , by whatever means , and hope there will be no further delay . ”
Mary Crawford	“ You would find it difficult , I dare say , just now , in the middle of a very late hay harvest , to hire a horse and cart ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before ; but when you _ do _ think of it , you must see the importance of getting in the grass . The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose : our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out ; but , in harvest , it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I shall be most happy to play to you both , ”
Mary Crawford	“ at least as long as you can like to listen : probably much longer , for I dearly love music myself , and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off , for she is gratified in more ways than one . Now , Mr. Bertram , if you write to your brother , I entreat you to tell him that my harp is come : he heard so much of my misery about it . And you may say , if you please , that I shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return , in compassion to his feelings , as I know his horse will lose . ”
Mary Crawford	“ No , I dare say , nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth , would you ever write to him , nor he to you , if it could be helped . The occasion would never be foreseen . What strange creatures brothers are ! You would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world ; and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill , or such a relation dead , it is done in the fewest possible words . You have but one style among you . I know it perfectly . Henry , who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be , who loves me , consults me , confides in me , and will talk to me by the hour together , has never yet turned the page in a letter ; and very often it is nothing more than—‘Dear Mary , I am just arrived . Bath seems full , and everything as usual . Yours sincerely . ’ That is the true manly style ; that is a complete brother ’s letter . ”
Mary Crawford	“ My dear Miss Price , ”
Mary Crawford	“ I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting ; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself — I knew it was very late , and that I was behaving extremely ill ; and therefore , if you please , you must forgive me . Selfishness must always be forgiven , you know , because there is no hope of a cure . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Now we shall have no more rough road , Miss Crawford ; our difficulties are over . The rest of the way is such as it ought to be . Mr. Rushworth has made it since he succeeded to the estate . Here begins the village . Those cottages are really a disgrace . The church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome . I am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places . The annoyance of the bells must be terrible . There is the parsonage : a tidy - looking house , and I understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people . Those are almshouses , built by some of the family . To the right is the steward ’s house ; he is a very respectable man . Now we are coming to the lodge - gates ; but we have nearly a mile through the park still . It is not ugly , you see , at this end ; there is some fine timber , but the situation of the house is dreadful . We go down hill to it for half a mile , and it is a pity , for it would not be an ill - looking place if it had a better approach . ”
Mary Crawford	“ it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect , ”
Mary Crawford	“ Now , where is the avenue ? The house fronts the east , I perceive . The avenue , therefore , must be at the back of it . Mr. Rushworth talked of the west front . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Yes , it is exactly behind the house ; begins at a little distance , and ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds . You may see something of it here — something of the more distant trees . It is oak entirely . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Every generation has its improvements , ”
Mary Crawford	“ Very fine indeed , ”
Mary Crawford	“ It must do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave business and pleasure , and say their prayers here twice a day , while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away . ”
Mary Crawford	“ At any rate , it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such subjects . Everybody likes to go their own way — to chuse their own time and manner of devotion . The obligation of attendance , the formality , the restraint , the length of time — altogether it is a formidable thing , and what nobody likes ; and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed , when they woke with a headache , without danger of reprobation , because chapel was missed , they would have jumped with joy and envy . Can not you imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel ? The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets — starched up into seeming piety , but with heads full of something very different — especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at — and , in those days , I fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now . ”
Mary Crawford	“ How distressed she will be at what she said just now , ”
Mary Crawford	“ Ordained ! ”
Mary Crawford	“ what , are you to be a clergyman ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Yes ; I shall take orders soon after my father ’s return — probably at Christmas . ”
Mary Crawford	“ If I had known this before , I would have spoken of the cloth with more respect , ”
Mary Crawford	“ This is insufferably hot , ”
Mary Crawford	“ Shall any of us object to being comfortable ? Here is a nice little wood , if one can but get into it . What happiness if the door should not be locked ! but of course it is ; for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they like . ”
Mary Crawford	“ So you are to be a clergyman , Mr. Bertram . This is rather a surprise to me . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Why should it surprise you ? You must suppose me designed for some profession , and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer , nor a soldier , nor a sailor . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Very true ; but , in short , it had not occurred to me . And you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son . ”
Mary Crawford	“ But why are you to be a clergyman ? I thought _ that _ was always the lot of the youngest , where there were many to chuse before him . ”
Mary Crawford	“ _ Never _ is a black word . But yes , in the _ never _ of conversation , which means _ not _ _ very _ _ often _ , I do think it . For what is to be done in the church ? Men love to distinguish themselves , and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained , but not in the church . A clergyman is nothing . ”
Mary Crawford	“ _ You _ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given , or than I can quite comprehend . One does not see much of this influence and importance in society , and how can it be acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves ? How can two sermons a week , even supposing them worth hearing , supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer Blair ’s to his own , do all that you speak of ? govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week ? One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit . ”
Mary Crawford	“ The metropolis , I imagine , is a pretty fair sample of the rest . ”
Mary Crawford	“ There , ”
Mary Crawford	“ you have quite convinced Miss Price already . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I must move , ”
Mary Crawford	“ resting fatigues me . I have looked across the ha - ha till I am weary . I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view , without being able to see it so well . ”
Mary Crawford	“ It is an immense distance , ”
Mary Crawford	“ I see _ that _ with a glance . ”
Mary Crawford	“ How happy Mr. Rushworth looks ! He is thinking of November . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Your father ’s return will be a very interesting event . ”
Mary Crawford	“ It will , indeed , after such an absence ; an absence not only long , but including so many dangers . ”
Mary Crawford	“ It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events : your sister ’s marriage , and your taking orders . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Yes . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Do n’t be affronted , ”
Mary Crawford	“ but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes , who , after performing great exploits in a foreign land , offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Oh yes I know it is . I was merely joking . She has done no more than what every young woman would do ; and I have no doubt of her being extremely happy . My other sacrifice , of course , you do not understand . ”
Mary Crawford	“ It is fortunate that your inclination and your father ’s convenience should accord so well . There is a very good living kept for you , I understand , hereabouts . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle , ”
Mary Crawford	“ that I can hardly suppose — and since you push me so hard , I must observe , that I am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are , being at this present time the guest of my own brother , Dr. Grant . And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me , and though he is really a gentleman , and , I dare say , a good scholar and clever , and often preaches good sermons , and is very respectable , _ I _ see him to be an indolent , selfish _ bon _ _ vivant _ , who must have his palate consulted in everything ; who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one ; and who , moreover , if the cook makes a blunder , is out of humour with his excellent wife . To own the truth , Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose , which he could not get the better of . My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it ”
Mary Crawford	“ My good friends , you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses , inside and out ; but pray let me know my fate in the meanwhile . Who is to be Anhalt ? What gentleman among you am I to have the pleasure of making love to ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ You chose very wisely , I am sure , ”
Mary Crawford	“ Anhalt is a heavy part . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I am not at all surprised , ”
Mary Crawford	“ at this want of an Anhalt . Amelia deserves no better . Such a forward young lady may well frighten the men . ”
Mary Crawford	“ They do not want me at all , ”
Mary Crawford	“ I only puzzle them , and oblige them to make civil speeches . Mr. Edmund Bertram , as you do not act yourself , you will be a disinterested adviser ; and , therefore , I apply to _ you _ . What shall we do for an Anhalt ? Is it practicable for any of the others to double it ? What is your advice ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ _ I _ should have no objection , ”
Mary Crawford	“ for though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported , that is , if everything went well , I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience ; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _ that _ _ table _ ”
Mary Crawford	“ it certainly will not be taken . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Never mind , my dear Miss Price , this is a cross evening : everybody is cross and teasing , but do not let us mind them ”
Mary Crawford	“ As far as I am concerned , I can have no objection to anything that you all think eligible . Have I ever seen either of the gentlemen ? Yes , Mr. Charles Maddox dined at my sister ’s one day , did not he , Henry ? A quiet - looking young man . I remember him . Let _ him _ be applied to , if you please , for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I am not very sanguine as to our play , ”
Mary Crawford	“ and I can tell Mr. Maddox that I shall shorten some of _ his _ speeches , and a great many of _ my _ _ own _ , before we rehearse together . It will be very disagreeable , and by no means what I expected . ”
Mary Crawford	“ He was certainly right in respecting such feelings ; he was glad he had determined on it . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Am I right ? Yes ; this is the East room . My dear Miss Price , I beg your pardon , but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Here it is . I did not think much of it at first — but , upon my word . There , look at _ that _ speech , and _ that _ , and _ that _ . How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things ? Could you do it ? But then he is your cousin , which makes all the difference . You must rehearse it with me , that I may fancy _ you _ him , and get on by degrees . You _ have _ a look of _ his _ sometimes . ”
Mary Crawford	“ _ None _ of it , I suppose . You are to have the book , of course . Now for it . We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the front of the stage . There — very good school - room chairs , not made for a theatre , I dare say ; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson . What would your governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose ? Could Sir Thomas look in upon us just now , he would bless himself , for we are rehearsing all over the house . Yates is storming away in the dining - room . I heard him as I came upstairs , and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers , Agatha and Frederick . If _ they _ are not perfect , I _ shall _ be surprised . By the bye , I looked in upon them five minutes ago , and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying _ not _ to embrace , and Mr. Rushworth was with me . I thought he began to look a little queer , so I turned it off as well as I could , by whispering to him , ‘ We shall have an excellent Agatha ; there is something so _ maternal _ in her manner , so completely _ maternal _ in her voice and countenance . ’ Was not that well done of me ? He brightened up directly . Now for my soliloquy . ”
Mary Crawford	“ To - morrow , I think , my uncle dines at Sotherton , and you and Mr. Bertram too . We shall be quite a small party at home . I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr. Rushworth . ”
Mary Crawford	“ That is impossible , Fanny . He must like him less after to - morrow ’s visit , for we shall be five hours in his company . I should dread the stupidity of the day , if there were not a much greater evil to follow — the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas . He can not much longer deceive himself . I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Shall I play to you now ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Another quarter of an hour , ”
Mary Crawford	“ and we shall see how it will be . Do not run away the first moment of its holding up . Those clouds look alarming . ”
Mary Crawford	“ South or north , I know a black cloud when I see it ; and you must not set forward while it is so threatening . And besides , I want to play something more to you — a very pretty piece — and your cousin Edmund ’s prime favourite . You must stay and hear your cousin ’s favourite . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Yes , ”
Mary Crawford	“ it does very well for a place of this sort . One does not think of extent _ here _ ; and between ourselves , till I came to Mansfield , I had not imagined a country parson ever aspired to a shrubbery , or anything of the kind . ”
Mary Crawford	“ To say the truth , ”
Mary Crawford	“ I am something like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV . ; and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it . If anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home , that I should be spending month after month here , as I have done , I certainly should not have believed them . I have now been here nearly five months ; and , moreover , the quietest five months I ever passed . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than I had ever expected to be . I can even suppose it pleasant to spend _ half _ the year in the country , under certain circumstances , very pleasant . An elegant , moderate - sized house in the centre of family connexions ; continual engagements among them ; commanding the first society in the neighbourhood ; looked up to , perhaps , as leading it even more than those of larger fortune , and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a _ tête - à - tête _ with the person one feels most agreeable in the world . There is nothing frightful in such a picture , is there , Miss Price ? One need not envy the new Mrs. Rushworth with such a home as _ that _ . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Ah ! here he is . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Well , ”
Mary Crawford	“ and do you not scold us for our imprudence ? What do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it , and entreated and supplicated never to do so again ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Upon my word , ”
Mary Crawford	“ you are two of the most disappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with ! There is no giving you a moment ’s uneasiness . You do not know how much we have been suffering , nor what chills we have felt ! But I have long thought Mr. Bertram one of the worst subjects to work on , in any little manoeuvre against common sense , that a woman could be plagued with . I had very little hope of _ him _ from the first ; but you , Mrs. Grant , my sister , my own sister , I think I had a right to alarm you a little . ”
Mary Crawford	“ The sweets of housekeeping in a country village ! ”
Mary Crawford	“ Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Oh ! you can do nothing but what you do already : be plagued very often , and never lose your temper . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort . A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of . It certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it . ”
Mary Crawford	“ To be sure . Do not you ? Do not we all ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ I can not intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power to command . Miss Crawford may chuse her degree of wealth . She has only to fix on her number of thousands a year , and there can be no doubt of their coming . My intentions are only not to be poor . ”
Mary Crawford	“ By moderation and economy , and bringing down your wants to your income , and all that . I understand you — and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life , with such limited means and indifferent connexions . What can _ you _ want but a decent maintenance ? You have not much time before you ; and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you , or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence . Be honest and poor , by all means — but I shall not envy you ; I do not much think I shall even respect you . I have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Your degree of respect for honesty , rich or poor , is precisely what I have no manner of concern with . I do not mean to be poor . Poverty is exactly what I have determined against . Honesty , in the something between , in the middle state of worldly circumstances , is all that I am anxious for your not looking down on . ”
Mary Crawford	“ But I do look down upon it , if it might have been higher . I must look down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to distinction . ”
Mary Crawford	“ But how may it rise ? How may my honesty at least rise to any distinction ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Oh ! ”
Mary Crawford	“ Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss . ”
Mary Crawford	“ There , I will stake my last like a woman of spirit . No cold prudence for me . I am not born to sit still and do nothing . If I lose the game , it shall not be from not striving for it . ”
Mary Crawford	“ My plan may not be the best possible : I had not many minutes to form it in ; but you must do a good deal . The place deserves it , and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of . ( Excuse me , your ladyship must not see your cards . There , let them lie just before you . ) The place deserves it , Bertram . You talk of giving it the air of a gentleman ’s residence . _ That _ will be done by the removal of the farmyard ; for , independent of that terrible nuisance , I never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman ’s residence , so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage - house — above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year . It is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms , with as many roofs as windows ; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse : it is a solid , roomy , mansion - like looking house , such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation , through two centuries at least , and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Mr. Bertram , ”
Mary Crawford	“ you know Henry to be such a capital improver , that you can not possibly engage in anything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help . Only think how useful he was at Sotherton ! Only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in August to drive about the grounds , and see his genius take fire . There we went , and there we came home again ; and what was done there is not to be told ! ”
Mary Crawford	“ Yes , ”
Mary Crawford	“ No . ”
Mary Crawford	“ no ”
Mary Crawford	“ yes ”
Mary Crawford	“ no ”
Mary Crawford	parts—“But what shall you have by way of necklace ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Shall not you wear your brother ’s cross ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ You see what a collection I have , ”
Mary Crawford	“ more by half than I ever use or think of . I do not offer them as new . I offer nothing but an old necklace . You must forgive the liberty , and oblige me . ”
Mary Crawford	“ When I wear this necklace I shall always think of you , ”
Mary Crawford	“ and feel how very kind you were . ”
Mary Crawford	“ You must think of somebody else too , when you wear that necklace , ”
Mary Crawford	“ You must think of Henry , for it was his choice in the first place . He gave it to me , and with the necklace I make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver . It is to be a family remembrancer . The sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too . ”
Mary Crawford	“ My dear child , ”
Mary Crawford	“ what are you afraid of ? Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine , and fancy you did not come honestly by it ? or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago , before he knew there was such a throat in the world ? or perhaps”—looking
Mary Crawford	archly—“you suspect a confederacy between us , and that what I am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Well , then , ”
Mary Crawford	“ to convince me that you suspect no trick , and are as unsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you , take the necklace and say no more about it . Its being a gift of my brother ’s need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it , as I assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it . He is always giving me something or other . I have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember half . And as for this necklace , I do not suppose I have worn it six times : it is very pretty , but I never think of it ; and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket - box , you have happened to fix on the very one which , if I have a choice , I would rather part with and see in your possession than any other . Say no more against it , I entreat you . Such a trifle is not worth half so many words . ”
Mary Crawford	“ you are all considerate thought ! But it is unnecessary here . The time will never come . No such time as you allude to will ever come . I begin to think it most improbable : the chances grow less and less ; and even if it should , there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of , for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples ; and if they are removed , it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had . You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said ; but you have always known my opinion of her ; you can bear me witness , Fanny , that I have never been blinded . How many a time have we talked over her little errors ! You need not fear me ; I have almost given up every serious idea of her ; but I must be a blockhead indeed , if , whatever befell me , I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Did he ? Did Edmund ? That was like himself . No other man would have thought of it . I honour him beyond expression . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Well , then , ”
Mary Crawford	“ I must suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother , and of talking of you by the way . ”
Mary Crawford	could—“And how do _ you _ like your cousin Edmund ’s staying away so long ? Being the only young person at home , I consider _ you _ as the greatest sufferer . You must miss him . Does his staying longer surprise you ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of . It is the general way all young men do . ”
Mary Crawford	“ He finds the house more agreeable _ now _ . He is a very — a very pleasing young man himself , and I can not help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London , as will now undoubtedly be the case . I am looking for Henry every day , and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield . I should like to have seen him once more , I confess . But you must give my compliments to him . Yes ; I think it must be compliments . Is not there a something wanted , Miss Price , in our language — a something between compliments and — and love — to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together ? So many months ’ acquaintance ! But compliments may be sufficient here . Was his letter a long one ? Does he give you much account of what he is doing ? Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Oh ! if he wrote to his father ; but I thought it might have been to Lady Bertram or you . But if he wrote to his father , no wonder he was concise . Who could write chat to Sir Thomas ? If he had written to you , there would have been more particulars . You would have heard of balls and parties . He would have sent you a description of everything and everybody . How many Miss Owens are there ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Are they musical ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ That is the first question , you know , ”
Mary Crawford	“ which every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another . But it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies — about any three sisters just grown up ; for one knows , without being told , exactly what they are : all very accomplished and pleasing , and one very pretty . There is a beauty in every family ; it is a regular thing . Two play on the pianoforte , and one on the harp ; and all sing , or would sing if they were taught , or sing all the better for not being taught ; or something like it . ”
Mary Crawford	“ You know nothing and you care less , as people say . Never did tone express indifference plainer . Indeed , how can one care for those one has never seen ? Well , when your cousin comes back , he will find Mansfield very quiet ; all the noisy ones gone , your brother and mine and myself . I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near . She does not like my going . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Oh yes ! missed as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away ; that is , there is a great difference felt . But I am not fishing ; do n’t compliment me . If I _ am _ missed , it will appear . I may be discovered by those who want to see me . I shall not be in any doubtful , or distant , or unapproachable region . ”
Mary Crawford	“ The Miss Owens , ”
Mary Crawford	“ suppose you were to have one of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey ; how should you like it ? Stranger things have happened . I dare say they are trying for it . And they are quite in the right , for it would be a very pretty establishment for them . I do not at all wonder or blame them . It is everybody ’s duty to do as well for themselves as they can . Sir Thomas Bertram ’s son is somebody ; and now he is in their own line . Their father is a clergyman , and their brother is a clergyman , and they are all clergymen together . He is their lawful property ; he fairly belongs to them . You do n’t speak , Fanny ; Miss Price , you do n’t speak . But honestly now , do not you rather expect it than otherwise ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Not at all ! ”
Mary Crawford	“ I wonder at that . But I dare say you know exactly — I always imagine you are — perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all — or not at present . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere ”
Mary Crawford	“ Sad , sad girl ! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you , ”
Mary Crawford	“ I hate to leave you . I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going . Who says we shall not be sisters ? I know we shall . I feel that we are born to be connected ; and those tears convince me that you feel it too , dear Fanny . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Her uncle , she understood , meant to fetch her ; and as her cousin ’s illness had continued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary , she must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present , and that she should be felt an encumbrance . ”
Mary Crawford	“ ‘ I heard you were in town , ’ said she ; ‘ I wanted to see you . Let us talk over this sad business . What can equal the folly of our two relations ? ’ I could not answer , but I believe my looks spoke . She felt reproved . Sometimes how quick to feel ! With a graver look and voice she then added , ‘ I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister ’s expense . ’ So she began , but how she went on , Fanny , is not fit , is hardly fit to be repeated to you . I can not recall all her words . I would not dwell upon them if I could . Their substance was great anger at the _ folly _ of each . She reprobated her brother ’s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for , to do what must lose him the woman he adored ; but still more the folly of poor Maria , in sacrificing such a situation , plunging into such difficulties , under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear . Guess what I must have felt . To hear the woman whom — no harsher name than folly given ! So voluntarily , so freely , so coolly to canvass it ! No reluctance , no horror , no feminine , shall I say , no modest loathings ? This is what the world does . For where , Fanny , shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed ? Spoilt , spoilt ! ”
Mary Crawford	“ My dear sister , ”
Mary Crawford	“ if you can persuade him into anything of the sort , it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever , and I shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of . If you can persuade Henry to marry , you must have the address of a Frenchwoman . All that English abilities can do has been tried already . I have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn ; and the pains which they , their mothers ( very clever women ) , as well as my dear aunt and myself , have taken to reason , coax , or trick him into marrying , is inconceivable ! He is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined . If your Miss Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke , let them avoid Henry . ”
Mary Crawford	“ No , I am sure you are too good . You will be kinder than Mary . You will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience . I am of a cautious temper , and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry . Nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself . I consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet—‘Heaven ’s _ last _ best gift . ’ ”
Mary Crawford	“ I dare say she is , ”
Mary Crawford	“ I imagine both sisters are . ”
Mary Crawford	“ You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth . It may do _ her _ some good . I often think of Mr. Rushworth ’s property and independence , and wish them in other hands ; but I never think of him . A man might represent the county with such an estate ; a man might escape a profession and represent the county . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home , ”
Mary Crawford	“ Do you remember Hawkins Browne ’s ‘ Address to Tobacco , ’ in imitation of Pope ? —
Mary Crawford	“ Moderation itself ! ”
Mary Crawford	“ I can have no scruples now . Well , you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself , for we are a great deal together . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Sitting with them an hour and a half ! ”
Mary Crawford	“ Lucky , lucky girl ! ”
Mary Crawford	“ what a match for her ! My dearest Henry , this must be my _ first _ feeling ; but my _ second _ , which you shall have as sincerely , is , that I approve your choice from my soul , and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it . You will have a sweet little wife ; all gratitude and devotion . Exactly what you deserve . What an amazing match for her ! Mrs. Norris often talks of her luck ; what will she say now ? The delight of all the family , indeed ! And she has some _ true _ friends in it ! How _ they _ will rejoice ! But tell me all about it ! Talk to me for ever . When did you begin to think seriously about her ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Ha ! ”
Mary Crawford	“ settle in Northamptonshire ! That is pleasant ! Then we shall be all together . ”
Mary Crawford	“ My dearest Henry , ”
Mary Crawford	“ how glad I am to see you so much in love ! It quite delights me . But what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say ? ”
Mary Crawford	“ Nay , Henry , not by all ; not forgotten by all ; not friendless or forgotten . Her cousin Edmund never forgets her . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Excellent creature ! I will not tease you . Everything shall take its course . But , dear Fanny , you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies . It is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject , some surmises as to what might be . You must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power . Was not he devoted to you at the ball ? And then before the ball , the necklace ! Oh ! you received it just as it was meant . You were as conscious as heart could desire . I remember it perfectly . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Do you mean , then , that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand ? Oh ! Miss Crawford , _ that _ was not fair . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Knew of it ! It was his own doing entirely , his own thought . I am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head , but I was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Ah ! I can not deny it . He has now and then been a sad flirt , and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies ’ affections . I have often scolded him for it , but it is his only fault ; and there is this to be said , that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for . And then , Fanny , the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many ; of having it in one ’s power to pay off the debts of one ’s sex ! Oh ! I am sure it is not in woman ’s nature to refuse such a triumph . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I do not defend him . I leave him entirely to your mercy , and when he has got you at Everingham , I do not care how much you lecture him . But this I will say , that his fault , the liking to make girls a little in love with him , is not half so dangerous to a wife ’s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself , which he has never been addicted to . And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before ; that he loves you with all his heart , and will love you as nearly for ever as possible . If any man ever loved a woman for ever , I think Henry will do as much for you . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I can not imagine Henry ever to have been happier , ”
Mary Crawford	“ than when he had succeeded in getting your brother ’s commission . ”
Mary Crawford	“ Oh ! yes . How very , very kind of him . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I know he must have exerted himself very much , for I know the parties he had to move . The Admiral hates trouble , and scorns asking favours ; and there are so many young men ’s claims to be attended to in the same way , that a friendship and energy , not very determined , is easily put by . What a happy creature William must be ! I wish we could see him . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I should like to sit talking with you here all day , but we must not forget the ladies below , and so good - bye , my dear , my amiable , my excellent Fanny , for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast - parlour , I must take leave of you here . And I do take leave , longing for a happy reunion , and trusting that when we meet again , it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve . ”
Mary Crawford	“ I shall see your cousin in town soon : he talks of being there tolerably soon ; and Sir Thomas , I dare say , in the course of the spring ; and your eldest cousin , and the Rushworths , and Julia , I am sure of meeting again and again , and all but you . I have two favours to ask , Fanny : one is your correspondence . You must write to me . And the other , that you will often call on Mrs. Grant , and make her amends for my being gone . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly , sister , ”
Henry Crawford	“ they are very elegant , agreeable girls . ”
Henry Crawford	“ So they are indeed , and I am delighted to hear you say it . But you like Julia best . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Oh yes ! I like Julia best . ”
Henry Crawford	“ But do you really ? for Miss Bertram is in general thought the handsomest . ”
Henry Crawford	“ So I should suppose . She has the advantage in every feature , and I prefer her countenance ; but I like Julia best ; Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest , and I have found her the most agreeable , but I shall always like Julia best , because you order me . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I shall not talk to you , Henry , but I know you _ will _ like her best at last . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Do not I tell you that I like her best _ at _ _ first _ ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ And besides , Miss Bertram is engaged . Remember that , my dear brother . Her choice is made . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Yes , and I like her the better for it . An engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged . She is satisfied with herself . Her cares are over , and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion . All is safe with a lady engaged : no harm can be done . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Why , as to that , Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man , and it is a great match for her . ”
Henry Crawford	“ But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him ; _ that _ is your opinion of your intimate friend . _ I _ do not subscribe to it . I am sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth . I could see it in her eyes , when he was mentioned . I think too well of Miss Bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Mary , how shall we manage him ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ We must leave him to himself , I believe . Talking does no good . He will be taken in at last . ”
Henry Crawford	“ But I would not have him _ taken _ _ in _ ; I would not have him duped ; I would have it all fair and honourable . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Oh dear ! let him stand his chance and be taken in . It will do just as well . Everybody is taken in at some period or other . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Not always in marriage , dear Mary . ”
Henry Crawford	“ In marriage especially . With all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married , my dear Mrs. Grant , there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry . Look where I will , I see that it _ is _ so ; and I feel that it _ must _ be so , when I consider that it is , of all transactions , the one in which people expect most from others , and are least honest themselves . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Ah ! You have been in a bad school for matrimony , in Hill Street . ”
Henry Crawford	“ My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state ; but , however , speaking from my own observation , it is a manoeuvring business . I know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion , or accomplishment , or good quality in the person , who have found themselves entirely deceived , and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse . What is this but a take in ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ My dear child , there must be a little imagination here . I beg your pardon , but I can not quite believe you . Depend upon it , you see but half . You see the evil , but you do not see the consolation . There will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere , and we are all apt to expect too much ; but then , if one scheme of happiness fails , human nature turns to another ; if the first calculation is wrong , we make a second better : we find comfort somewhere — and those evil - minded observers , dearest Mary , who make much of a little , are more taken in and deceived than the parties themselves . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Well done , sister ! I honour your _ esprit _ _ du _ _ corps _ . When I am a wife , I mean to be just as staunch myself ; and I wish my friends in general would be so too . It would save me many a heartache . ”
Henry Crawford	“ You are as bad as your brother , Mary ; but we will cure you both . Mansfield shall cure you both , and without any taking in . Stay with us , and we will cure you . ”
Henry Crawford	“ To be depriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments , might be an evil even beyond the loss of present pleasure . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I do not like to see Miss Bertram so near the altar . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly , ”
Henry Crawford	“ My dear Edmund , if you were but in orders now , you might perform the ceremony directly . How unlucky that you are not ordained ; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Query , ”
Henry Crawford	“ whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther ? I see walls of great promise . Mr. Rushworth , shall we summon a council on this lawn ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now , as we are so far from the house already , ”
Henry Crawford	“ I hope I am not to lose my companion , unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Poor Rushworth and his two - and - forty speeches ! ”
Henry Crawford	“ Nobody can ever forget them . Poor fellow ! I see him now — his toil and his despair . Well , I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two - and - forty speeches to her ”
Henry Crawford	“ Bertram , ”
Henry Crawford	“ I have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home . ”
Henry Crawford	“ No , no , you must not part with the queen . You have bought her too dearly , and your brother does not offer half her value . No , no , sir , hands off , hands off . Your sister does not part with the queen . She is quite determined . The game will be yours , ”
Henry Crawford	“ it will certainly be yours . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I can not say there was much done at Sotherton ; but it was a hot day , and we were all walking after each other , and bewildered . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I should be sorry to have my powers of _ planning _ judged of by the day at Sotherton . I see things very differently now . Do not think of me as I appeared then . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Certainly , sir , I have no idea but of residence . But , Crawford , though I refuse you as a tenant , come to me as a friend . Consider the house as half your own every winter , and we will add to the stables on your own improved plan , and with all the improvements of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Fanny , ”
Henry Crawford	“ I beg your pardon for being here . I came to look for you , and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in , was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand . You will find the beginning of a note to yourself ; but I can now speak my business , which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle — a chain for William ’s cross . You ought to have had it a week ago , but there has been a delay from my brother ’s not being in town by several days so soon as I expected ; and I have only just now received it at Northampton . I hope you will like the chain itself , Fanny . I endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste ; but , at any rate , I know you will be kind to my intentions , and consider it , as it really is , a token of the love of one of your oldest friends . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Yes , half - past nine , ”
Henry Crawford	“ and I shall be punctual , for there will be no kind sister to get up for _ me _ . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I shall have only a desolate house to hurry from . Your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to - morrow . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Advise ”
Henry Crawford	“ You can not think I mean to hurry you , ”
Henry Crawford	“ you can not think I have any such object . Do not hurry yourself , I entreat . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Oh ! I thank you ; I have quite done , just done ; it will be ready in a moment ; I am very much obliged to you ; if you will be so good as to give _ that _ to Miss Crawford . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Let me have the pleasure of finishing that speech to your ladyship , ”
Henry Crawford	“ I shall find it immediately . ”
Henry Crawford	“ It will be a favourite , I believe , from this hour , ”
Henry Crawford	“ but I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand before since I was fifteen . I once saw Henry the Eighth acted , or I have heard of it from somebody who did , I am not certain which . But Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how . It is a part of an Englishman ’s constitution . His thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere ; one is intimate with him by instinct . No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of his plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Sir , you do me honour , ”
Henry Crawford	“ Our liturgy , ”
Henry Crawford	“ has beauties , which not even a careless , slovenly style of reading can destroy ; but it has also redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt . For myself , at least , I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be ”
Henry Crawford	“ that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read , and longing to have it to read myself . Did you speak ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ No , ”
Henry Crawford	“ Are you sure you did not speak ? I saw your lips move . I fancied you might be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive , and not _ allow _ my thoughts to wander . Are not you going to tell me so ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ A sermon , well delivered , is more uncommon even than prayers well read . A sermon , good in itself , is no rare thing . It is more difficult to speak well than to compose well ; that is , the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study . A thoroughly good sermon , thoroughly well delivered , is a capital gratification . I can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect , and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself . There is something in the eloquence of the pulpit , when it is really eloquence , which is entitled to the highest praise and honour . The preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers , on subjects limited , and long worn threadbare in all common hands ; who can say anything new or striking , anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste , or wearing out the feelings of his hearers , is a man whom one could not , in his public capacity , honour enough . I should like to be such a man . ”
Henry Crawford	“ What did that shake of the head mean ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ What was it meant to express ? Disapprobation , I fear . But of what ? What had I been saying to displease you ? Did you think me speaking improperly , lightly , irreverently on the subject ? Only tell me if I was . Only tell me if I was wrong . I want to be set right . Nay , nay , I entreat you ; for one moment put down your work . What did that shake of the head mean ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ How can you , sir ? You quite astonish me ; I wonder how you can — ”
Henry Crawford	“ Do I astonish you ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ Do you wonder ? Is there anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand ? I will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner , all that gives me an interest in what you look and do , and excites my present curiosity . I will not leave you to wonder long . ”
Henry Crawford	“ You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy . Yes , that was the word . Constancy : I am not afraid of the word . I would spell it , read it , write it with anybody . I see nothing alarming in the word . Did you think I ought ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ Well , ”
Henry Crawford	“ I am happier than I was , because I now understand more clearly your opinion of me . You think me unsteady : easily swayed by the whim of the moment , easily tempted , easily put aside . With such an opinion , no wonder that — But we shall see.—It is not by protestations that I shall endeavour to convince you I am wronged ; it is not by telling you that my affections are steady . My conduct shall speak for me ; absence , distance , time shall speak for me . _ They _ shall prove that , as far as you can be deserved by anybody , I do deserve you . You are infinitely my superior in merit ; all _ that _ I know . You have qualities which I had not before supposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature . You have some touches of the angel in you beyond what — not merely beyond what one sees , because one never sees anything like it — but beyond what one fancies might be . But still I am not frightened . It is not by equality of merit that you can be won . That is out of the question . It is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest , who loves you most devotedly , that has the best right to a return . There I build my confidence . By that right I do and will deserve you ; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I declare it , I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes . Yes , dearest , sweetest Fanny . Nay ”
Henry Crawford	“ forgive me . Perhaps I have as yet no right ; but by what other name can I call you ? Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other ? No , it is ‘ Fanny ’ that I think of all day , and dream of all night . You have given the name such reality of sweetness , that nothing else can now be descriptive of you . ”
Henry Crawford	“ It was a lovely morning , and at that season of the year a fine morning so often turned off , that it was wisest for everybody not to delay their exercise ”
Henry Crawford	“ Mansfield , Sotherton , Thornton Lacey , ”
Henry Crawford	“ what a society will be comprised in those houses ! And at Michaelmas , perhaps , a fourth may be added : some small hunting - box in the vicinity of everything so dear ; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey , as Edmund Bertram once good - humouredly proposed , I hope I foresee two objections : two fair , excellent , irresistible objections to that plan . ”
Henry Crawford	“ You have been here a month , I think ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ No ; not quite a month . It is only four weeks to - morrow since I left Mansfield . ”
Henry Crawford	“ You are a most accurate and honest reckoner . I should call that a month . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening . ”
Henry Crawford	“ And it is to be a two months ’ visit , is not ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ Yes . My uncle talked of two months . I suppose it will not be less . ”
Henry Crawford	“ And how are you to be conveyed back again ? Who comes for you ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ I do not know . I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt . Perhaps I may be to stay longer . It may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months ’ end . ”
Henry Crawford	“ No want of hands in our theatre , Miss Bertram . No want of understrappers : my sister desires her love , and hopes to be admitted into the company , and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante , that you may not like to do yourselves . ”
Henry Crawford	“ With all your partiality for Cottager ’s wife , ”
Henry Crawford	“ it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister , and we must not suffer her good - nature to be imposed on . We must not _ allow _ her to accept the part . She must not be left to her own complaisance . Her talents will be wanted in Amelia . Amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented than even Agatha . I consider Amelia is the most difficult character in the whole piece . It requires great powers , great nicety , to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance . I have seen good actresses fail in the part . Simplicity , indeed , is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession . It requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not . It requires a gentlewoman — a Julia Bertram . You _ will _ undertake it , I hope ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ You must oblige us , ”
Henry Crawford	“ indeed you must . When you have studied the character , I am sure you will feel it suit you . Tragedy may be your choice , but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _ you _ . You will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions ; you will not refuse to visit me in prison ? I think I see you coming in with your basket . ”
Henry Crawford	“ You have only to _ read _ the part , ”
Henry Crawford	“ Bertram , ”
Henry Crawford	“ I shall make a point of coming to Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon . I shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner . When is it to be ? Miss Price , will not you join me in encouraging your cousin ? Will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time — as I shall do — not to lose a word ; or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful ? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil . When will it be ? You must preach at Mansfield , you know , that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you . ”
Henry Crawford	“ And how do you think I mean to amuse myself , Mary , on the days that I do not hunt ? I am grown too old to go out more than three times a week ; but I have a plan for the intermediate days , and what do you think it is ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ To walk and ride with me , to be sure . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Not exactly , though I shall be happy to do both , but _ that _ would be exercise only to my body , and I must take care of my mind . Besides , _ that _ would be all recreation and indulgence , without the wholesome alloy of labour , and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness . No , my plan is to make Fanny Price in love with me . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Fanny Price ! Nonsense ! No , no . You ought to be satisfied with her two cousins . ”
Henry Crawford	“ But I can not be satisfied without Fanny Price , without making a small hole in Fanny Price ’s heart . You do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice . When we talked of her last night , you none of you seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her looks within the last six weeks . You see her every day , and therefore do not notice it ; but I assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn . She was then merely a quiet , modest , not plain - looking girl , but she is now absolutely pretty . I used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance ; but in that soft skin of hers , so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday , there is decided beauty ; and from what I observed of her eyes and mouth , I do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to express . And then , her air , her manner , her _ tout _ _ ensemble _ , is so indescribably improved ! She must be grown two inches , at least , since October . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Phoo ! phoo ! This is only because there were no tall women to compare her with , and because she has got a new gown , and you never saw her so well dressed before . She is just what she was in October , believe me . The truth is , that she was the only girl in company for you to notice , and you must have a somebody . I have always thought her pretty — not strikingly pretty — but ‘ pretty enough , ’ as people say ; a sort of beauty that grows on one . Her eyes should be darker , but she has a sweet smile ; but as for this wonderful degree of improvement , I am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress , and your having nobody else to look at ; and therefore , if you do set about a flirtation with her , you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty , or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Foolish fellow ! And so this is her attraction after all ! This it is , her not caring about you , which gives her such a soft skin , and makes her so much taller , and produces all these charms and graces ! I do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy ; a _ little _ love , perhaps , may animate and do her good , but I will not have you plunge her deep , for she is as good a little creature as ever lived , and has a great deal of feeling . ”
Henry Crawford	“ It can be but for a fortnight , ”
Henry Crawford	“ and if a fortnight can kill her , she must have a constitution which nothing could save . No , I will not do her any harm , dear little soul ! I only want her to look kindly on me , to give me smiles as well as blushes , to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are , and be all animation when I take it and talk to her ; to think as I think , be interested in all my possessions and pleasures , try to keep me longer at Mansfield , and feel when I go away that she shall be never happy again . I want nothing more . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Do you know , I begin to like that queer fashion already , though when I first heard of such things being done in England , I could not believe it ; and when Mrs. Brown , and the other women at the Commissioner ’s at Gibraltar , appeared in the same trim , I thought they were mad ; but Fanny can reconcile me to anything ”
Henry Crawford	“ I want to be your neighbour , Sir Thomas , as you have , perhaps , heard me telling Miss Price . May I hope for your acquiescence , and for your not influencing your son against such a tenant ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth , William ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance , Mr. Price , ”
Henry Crawford	“ and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject , to your entire satisfaction . But I believe ”
Henry Crawford	“ it must be at some other time . There is _ one _ person in company who does not like to have Miss Price spoken of . ”
Henry Crawford	“ My dear Henry , where can you have been all this time ? ”
Henry Crawford	“ Yes , Mary , ”
Henry Crawford	“ I could not get away sooner ; Fanny looked so lovely ! I am quite determined , Mary . My mind is entirely made up . Will it astonish you ? No : you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price . ”
Henry Crawford	“ Yes , Mary , ”
Henry Crawford	“ I am fairly caught . You know with what idle designs I began ; but this is the end of them . I have , I flatter myself , made no inconsiderable progress in her affections ; but my own are entirely fixed . ”
Henry Crawford	“ When Fanny is known to him , ”
Henry Crawford	“ he will doat on her . She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the Admiral , for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world . She is the very impossibility he would describe , if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas . But till it is absolutely settled — settled beyond all interference , he shall know nothing of the matter . No , Mary , you are quite mistaken . You have not discovered my business yet . ”
Henry Crawford	“ No . ”
Henry Crawford	“ For — for very little more than opportunity . Mary , she is not like her cousins ; but I think I shall not ask in vain . ”
Henry Crawford	“ I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her , ”
Henry Crawford	“ and _ that _ is what I want . ”
Henry Crawford	“ How kind ! how very kind ! Oh , Mr. Crawford , we are infinitely obliged to you ! Dearest , dearest William ! ”
Henry Crawford	“ She must not go , she must allow him five minutes longer , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I think we can not do better , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ let us send for the child . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ My dear Sir Thomas , I perfectly comprehend you , and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions , which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct ; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one ’s own hands ; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion . Having no children of my own , who should I look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow , but the children of my sisters?—and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just — but you know I am a woman of few words and professions . Do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle . Give a girl an education , and introduce her properly into the world , and ten to one but she has the means of settling well , without farther expense to anybody . A niece of ours , Sir Thomas , I may say , or at least of _ yours _ , would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages . I do n’t say she would be so handsome as her cousins . I dare say she would not ; but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as , in all human probability , would get her a creditable establishment . You are thinking of your sons — but do not you know that , of all things upon earth , _ that _ is the least likely to happen , brought up as they would be , always together like brothers and sisters ? It is morally impossible . I never knew an instance of it . It is , in fact , the only sure way of providing against the connexion . Suppose her a pretty girl , and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence , and I dare say there would be mischief . The very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect , would be enough to make either of the dear , sweet - tempered boys in love with her . But breed her up with them from this time , and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel , and she will never be more to either than a sister . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I thoroughly understand you , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ you are everything that is generous and considerate , and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point . Whatever I can do , as you well know , I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love ; and , though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children , nor consider her , in any respect , so much my own , I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her . Is not she a sister ’s child ? and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of bread to give her ? My dear Sir Thomas , with all my faults I have a warm heart ; and , poor as I am , would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing . So , if you are not against it , I will write to my poor sister tomorrow , and make the proposal ; and , as soon as matters are settled , _ I _ will engage to get the child to Mansfield ; _ you _ shall have no trouble about it . My own trouble , you know , I never regard . I will send Nanny to London on purpose , and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler ’s , and the child be appointed to meet her there . They may easily get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach , under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going . I dare say there is always some reputable tradesman ’s wife or other going up . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Very true , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ which are both very important considerations ; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she has three girls to teach , or only two — there can be no difference . I only wish I could be more useful ; but you see I do all in my power . I am not one of those that spare their own trouble ; and Nanny shall fetch her , however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days . I suppose , sister , you will put the child in the little white attic , near the old nurseries . It will be much the best place for her , so near Miss Lee , and not far from the girls , and close by the housemaids , who could either of them help to dress her , you know , and take care of her clothes , for I suppose you would not think it fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as the others . Indeed , I do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I hope she will prove a well - disposed girl , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ That is exactly what I think , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ and what I was saying to my husband this morning . It will be an education for the child , said I , only being with her cousins ; if Miss Lee taught her nothing , she would learn to be good and clever from _ them _ . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ This is not a very promising beginning , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ After all that I said to her as we came along , I thought she would have behaved better ; I told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first . I wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper — her poor mother had a good deal ; but we must make allowances for such a child — and I do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her , for , with all its faults , it _ was _ her home , and she can not as yet understand how much she has changed for the better ; but then there is moderation in all things . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I think , sister , we need not keep Miss Lee any longer , when Fanny goes to live with you . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Live with me , dear Lady Bertram ! what do you mean ? ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Me ! never . I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas , nor he to me . Fanny live with me ! the last thing in the world for me to think of , or for anybody to wish that really knows us both . Good heaven ! what could I do with Fanny ? Me ! a poor , helpless , forlorn widow , unfit for anything , my spirits quite broke down ; what could I do with a girl at her time of life ? A girl of fifteen ! the very age of all others to need most attention and care , and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test ! Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing ! Sir Thomas is too much my friend . Nobody that wishes me well , I am sure , would propose it . How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it ? ”
Mrs. Norris	“ But what did he say ? He could not say he _ wished _ me to take Fanny . I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Dear sister , if you consider my unhappy state , how can she be any comfort to me ? Here am I , a poor desolate widow , deprived of the best of husbands , my health gone in attending and nursing him , my spirits still worse , all my peace in this world destroyed , with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman , and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed — what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny ? If I could wish it for my own sake , I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl . She is in good hands , and sure of doing well . I must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as I can . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Lady Bertram , I do not complain . I know I can not live as I have done , but I must retrench where I can , and learn to be a better manager . I _ have _ _ been _ a liberal housekeeper enough , but I shall not be ashamed to practise economy now . My situation is as much altered as my income . A great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris , as clergyman of the parish , that can not be expected from me . It is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers . At the White House , matters must be better looked after . I _ must _ live within my income , or I shall be miserable ; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to be able to do rather more , to lay by a little at the end of the year . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ My object , Lady Bertram , is to be of use to those that come after me . It is for your children ’s good that I wish to be richer . I have nobody else to care for , but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little trifle among them worth their having . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Why , you know , Sir Thomas ’s means will be rather straitened if the Antigua estate is to make such poor returns . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Well , Lady Bertram , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ; besides that , I really should not have a bed to give her , for I must keep a spare room for a friend . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself ; nobody more hated pitiful doings ; the Parsonage , she believed , had never been wanting in comforts of any sort , had never borne a bad character in _ her _ _ time _ , but this was a way of going on that she could not understand . A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place . _ Her _ store - room , she thought , might have been good enough for Mrs. Grant to go into . Inquire where she would , she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Oh , for shame ! ”
Mrs. Norris	“ A prison indeed ? Sotherton Court is the noblest old place in the world . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ but depend upon it , Sotherton will have _ every _ improvement in time which his heart can desire . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ That is what I was thinking of . As he has done so well by Smith , I think I had better have him at once . His terms are five guineas a day . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Well , and if they were _ ten _ , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is : he is scarcely ever indulged with one , for it is so valuable a fruit ; with a little assistance , and ours is such a remarkably large , fair sort , that what with early tarts and preserves , my cook contrives to get them all . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford ’s willingness ; but why should not more of us go ? Why should not we make a little party ? Here are many that would be interested in your improvements , my dear Mr. Rushworth , and that would like to hear Mr. Crawford ’s opinion on the spot , and that might be of some small use to you with _ their _ opinions ; and , for my own part , I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again ; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss ; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth , while the rest of you walked about and settled things , and then we could all return to a late dinner here , or dine at Sotherton , just as might be most agreeable to your mother , and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight . I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche , and Edmund can go on horseback , you know , sister , and Fanny will stay at home with you . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ No , not that I know of , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ she was here a moment ago . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ That is a very foolish trick , Fanny , to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa . Why can not you come and sit here , and employ yourself as _ we _ do ? If you have no work of your own , I can supply you from the poor basket . There is all the new calico , that was bought last week , not touched yet . I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out . You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Go out ! to be sure she did , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ would you have her stay within such a fine day as this ? Were not we _ all _ out ? Even your mother was out to - day for above an hour . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I was out above an hour . I sat three - quarters of an hour in the flower - garden , while Fanny cut the roses ; and very pleasant it was , I assure you , but very hot . It was shady enough in the alcove , but I declare I quite dreaded the coming home again . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Yes , and I am afraid they will be the last this year . Poor thing ! _ She _ found it hot enough ; but they were so full - blown that one could not wait . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ There was no help for it , certainly , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ but I question whether her headache might not be caught _ then _ , sister . There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun ; but I dare say it will be well to - morrow . Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar ; I always forget to have mine filled . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ unless I had gone myself , indeed ; but I can not be in two places at once ; and I was talking to Mr. Green at that very time about your mother ’s dairymaid , by _ her _ desire , and had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son , and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour . I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion , but really I can not do everything at once . And as for Fanny ’s just stepping down to my house for me — it is not much above a quarter of a mile — I can not think I was unreasonable to ask it . How often do I pace it three times a day , early and late , ay , and in all weathers too , and say nothing about it ? ”
Mrs. Norris	“ If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise , she would not be knocked up so soon . She has not been out on horseback now this long while , and I am persuaded that , when she does not ride , she ought to walk . If she had been riding before , I should not have asked it of her . But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses ; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind ; and though the sun was strong , it was not so very hot . Between ourselves , Edmund , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ it was cutting the roses , and dawdling about in the flower - garden , that did the mischief . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ The fatigue would be too much for my sister , a great deal too much , I assure you , my dear Mrs. Rushworth . Ten miles there , and ten back , you know . You must excuse my sister on this occasion , and accept of our two dear girls and myself without her . Sotherton is the only place that could give her a _ wish _ to go so far , but it can not be , indeed . She will have a companion in Fanny Price , you know , so it will all do very well ; and as for Edmund , as he is not here to speak for himself , I will answer for his being most happy to join the party . He can go on horseback , you know . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ You are very kind , you are all kindness , my dear madam , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ but as to Fanny , she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton . She has time enough before her ; and her going now is quite out of the question . Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ And , my dear Edmund , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ taking out _ two _ carriages when _ one _ will do , would be trouble for nothing ; and , between ourselves , coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and Sotherton : he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage , and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas , when he comes home , find all the varnish scratched off . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Fanny ! ”
Mrs. Norris	“ my dear Edmund , there is no idea of her going with us . She stays with her aunt . I told Mrs. Rushworth so . She is not expected . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Very well , very well , just as you chuse , settle it your own way , I am sure I do not care about it . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Well , Fanny , this has been a fine day for you , upon my word , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Nothing but pleasure from beginning to end ! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go . A pretty good day ’s amusement you have had ! ”
Mrs. Norris	“ My dear , it is only a beautiful little heath , which that nice old gardener would make me take ; but if it is in your way , I will have it in my lap directly . There , Fanny , you shall carry that parcel for me ; take great care of it : do not let it fall ; it is a cream cheese , just like the excellent one we had at dinner . Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs. Whitaker , but my taking one of the cheeses . I stood out as long as I could , till the tears almost came into her eyes , and I knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with . That Mrs. Whitaker is a treasure ! She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table , and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns . Take care of the cheese , Fanny . Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Spunging , my dear ! It is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants ’ eggs , which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me : she would not take a denial . She said it must be such an amusement to me , as she understood I lived quite alone , to have a few living creatures of that sort ; and so to be sure it will . I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first spare hen , and if they come to good I can have them moved to my own house and borrow a coop ; and it will be a great delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them . And if I have good luck , your mother shall have some . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I think , ma’am , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ It is quite delightful , ma’am , to see young people so properly happy , so well suited , and so much the thing ! I can not but think of dear Sir Thomas ’s delight . And what do you say , ma’am , to the chance of another match ? Mr. Rushworth has set a good example , and such things are very catching . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ The couple above , ma’am . Do you see no symptoms there ? ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Oh dear ! Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford . Yes , indeed , a very pretty match . What is his property ? ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Four thousand a year . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Very well . Those who have not more must be satisfied with what they have . Four thousand a year is a pretty estate , and he seems a very genteel , steady young man , so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ It is not a settled thing , ma’am , yet . We only speak of it among friends . But I have very little doubt it _ will _ be . He is growing extremely particular in his attentions . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I was just going to say the very same thing , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ If every play is to be objected to , you will act nothing , and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away , and I am sure _ that _ would be a discredit to us all . I do not know the play ; but , as Maria says , if there is anything a little too warm ( and it is so with most of them ) it can be easily left out . We must not be over - precise , Edmund . As Mr. Rushworth is to act too , there can be no harm . I only wish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began , for there was the loss of half a day ’s work about those side - doors . The curtain will be a good job , however . The maids do their work very well , and I think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings . There is no occasion to put them so very close together . I _ am _ of some use , I hope , in preventing waste and making the most of things . There should always be one steady head to superintend so many young ones . I forgot to tell Tom of something that happened to me this very day . I had been looking about me in the poultry - yard , and was just coming out , when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants ’ hall - door with two bits of deal board in his hand , bringing them to father , you may be sure ; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father , and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board , for he could not no how do without them . I knew what all this meant , for the servants ’ dinner - bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads ; and as I hate such encroaching people ( the Jacksons are very encroaching , I have always said so : just the sort of people to get all they can ) , I said to the boy directly ( a great lubberly fellow of ten years old , you know , who ought to be ashamed of himself ) , ‘ _ I ’ll _ take the boards to your father , Dick , so get you home again as fast as you can . ’ The boy looked very silly , and turned away without offering a word , for I believe I might speak pretty sharp ; and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while . I hate such greediness — so good as your father is to the family , employing the man all the year round ! ”
Mrs. Norris	audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you ! Take the part with a good grace , and let us hear no more of the matter , I entreat . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I am not going to urge her , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ but I shall think her a very obstinate , ungrateful girl , if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her — very ungrateful , indeed , considering who and what she is . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ To have it quite in their own family circle was what they had particularly wished . A stranger among them would have been the destruction of all their comfort ”
Mrs. Norris	it—“Come , Fanny , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ these are fine times for you , but you must not be always walking from one room to the other , and doing the lookings - on at your ease , in this way ; I want you here . I have been slaving myself till I can hardly stand , to contrive Mr. Rushworth ’s cloak without sending for any more satin ; and now I think you may give me your help in putting it together . There are but three seams ; you may do them in a trice . It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part to do . _ You _ are best off , I can tell you : but if nobody did more than _ you _ , we should not get on very fast . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ You had better stay till the curtain is hung , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ the curtain will be hung in a day or two — there is very little sense in a play without a curtain — and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Sure , my dear Sir Thomas , a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea . Do have a basin of soup . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Well , then , Lady Bertram , suppose you speak for tea directly ; suppose you hurry Baddeley a little ; he seems behindhand to - night . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately , Sir Thomas ? They have been acting . We have been all alive with acting . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Indeed ! and what have you been acting ? ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Oh ! they ’ll tell you all about it . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ If I had not been active , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ and made a point of being introduced to his mother , and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit , I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come of it ; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement , and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle . But I left no stone unturned . I was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister , and at last I did persuade her . You know the distance to Sotherton ; it was in the middle of winter , and the roads almost impassable , but I did persuade her . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I know how great , how justly great , your influence is with Lady Bertram and her children , and am the more concerned that it should not have been — ”
Mrs. Norris	“ My dear Sir Thomas , if you had seen the state of the roads _ that _ day ! I thought we should never have got through them , though we had the four horses of course ; and poor old coachman would attend us , out of his great love and kindness , though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since Michaelmas . I cured him at last ; but he was very bad all the winter — and this was such a day , I could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture : he was putting on his wig ; so I said , ‘ Coachman , you had much better not go ; your Lady and I shall be very safe ; you know how steady Stephen is , and Charles has been upon the leaders so often now , that I am sure there is no fear . ’ But , however , I soon found it would not do ; he was bent upon going , and as I hate to be worrying and officious , I said no more ; but my heart quite ached for him at every jolt , and when we got into the rough lanes about Stoke , where , what with frost and snow upon beds of stones , it was worse than anything you can imagine , I was quite in an agony about him . And then the poor horses too ! To see them straining away ! You know how I always feel for the horses . And when we got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill , what do you think I did ? You will laugh at me ; but I got out and walked up . I did indeed . It might not be saving them much , but it was something , and I could not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense of those noble animals . I caught a dreadful cold , but _ that _ I did not regard . My object was accomplished in the visit . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that might be taken to establish it . There is nothing very striking in Mr. Rushworth ’s manners , but I was pleased last night with what appeared to be his opinion on one subject : his decided preference of a quiet family party to the bustle and confusion of acting . He seemed to feel exactly as one could wish . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Yes , indeed , and the more you know of him the better you will like him . He is not a shining character , but he has a thousand good qualities ; and is so disposed to look up to you , that I am quite laughed at about it , for everybody considers it as my doing . ‘ Upon my word , Mrs. Norris , ’ said Mrs. Grant the other day , ‘ if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own , he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect . ’ ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Upon my word , Fanny , you are in high luck to meet with such attention and indulgence ! You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking of you , and to your aunt for letting you go , and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary ; for I hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way , or ever dining out at all ; and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated . Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to _ you _ ; the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me . Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to _ us _ to take a little notice of you , or else it would never have come into her head , and you may be very certain that , if your cousin Julia had been at home , you would not have been asked at all . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ The nonsense and folly of people ’s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves , makes me think it right to give _ you _ a hint , Fanny , now that you are going into company without any of us ; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward , and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins — as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia . _ That _ will never do , believe me . Remember , wherever you are , you must be the lowest and last ; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage , you are not to be taking place of her . And as to coming away at night , you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses . Leave him to settle _ that _ . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Yes , ma’am , I should not think of anything else . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ And if it should rain , which I think exceedingly likely , for I never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life , you must manage as well as you can , and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you . I certainly do not go home to - night , and , therefore , the carriage will not be out on my account ; so you must make up your mind to what may happen , and take your things accordingly . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ My dear Sir Thomas ! ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Fanny can walk . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Sotherton ! Yes , that is a place , indeed , and we had a charming day there . William , you are quite out of luck ; but the next time you come , I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at home , and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly received by both . Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations , and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man . They are at Brighton now , you know ; in one of the best houses there , as Mr. Rushworth ’s fine fortune gives them a right to be . I do not exactly know the distance , but when you get back to Portsmouth , if it is not very far off , you ought to go over and pay your respects to them ; and I could send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your cousins . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I should be very happy , aunt ; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head ; and if I could get so far , I could not expect to be welcome in such a smart place as that — poor scrubby midshipman as I am . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Come , Fanny , Fanny , what are you about ? We are going . Do not you see your aunt is going ? Quick , quick ! I can not bear to keep good old Wilcox waiting . You should always remember the coachman and horses . My dear Sir Thomas , we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you , and Edmund and William . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Ah , my dear Sir Thomas ! ”
Mrs. Norris	“ I knew what was coming . I knew what you were going to say . If dear Julia were at home , or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton , to afford a reason , an occasion for such a thing , you would be tempted to give the young people a dance at Mansfield . I know you would . If _ they _ were at home to grace the ball , a ball you would have this very Christmas . Thank your uncle , William , thank your uncle ! ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Look well ! Oh , yes ! ”
Mrs. Norris	“ she has good reason to look well with all her advantages : brought up in this family as she has been , with all the benefit of her cousins ’ manners before her . Only think , my dear Sir Thomas , what extraordinary advantages you and I have been the means of giving her . The very gown you have been taking notice of is your own generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married . What would she have been if we had not taken her by the hand ? ”
Mrs. Norris	offered—“Ah ! ma’am , how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to - night ! ”
Mrs. Norris	“ _ Now _ William would be able to keep himself , which would make a vast difference to his uncle , for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle ; and , indeed , it would make some difference in _ her _ presents too . She was very glad that she had given William what she did at parting , very glad , indeed , that it had been in her power , without material inconvenience , just at that time to give him something rather considerable ; that is , for _ her _ , with _ her _ limited means , for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin . She knew he must be at some expense , that he would have many things to buy , though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap ; but she was very glad she had contributed her mite towards it . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Indeed ! ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Upon my word , he must have gone off with his pockets well lined , and at no expense for his journey to London either ! ”
Mrs. Norris	“ It is amazing , ”
Mrs. Norris	“ how much young people cost their friends , what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world ! They little think how much it comes to , or what their parents , or their uncles and aunts , pay for them in the course of the year . Now , here are my sister Price ’s children ; take them all together , I dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year , to say nothing of what _ I _ do for them . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Oh ! ”
Mrs. Norris	“ that was very kind of you , Sir Thomas ; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house . Fanny would have had quite as good a walk there , I assure you , with the advantage of being of some use , and obliging her aunt : it is all her fault . If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is a something about Fanny , I have often observed it before — she likes to go her own way to work ; she does not like to be dictated to ; she takes her own independent walk whenever she can ; she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy , and independence , and nonsense , about her , which I would advise her to get the better of . ”
Mrs. Norris	“ Stay , stay , Fanny ! what are you about ? where are you going ? do n’t be in such a hurry . Depend upon it , it is not you who are wanted ; depend upon it , it is me ”
Mrs. Norris	“ but you are so very eager to put yourself forward . What should Sir Thomas want you for ? It is me , Baddeley , you mean ; I am coming this moment . You mean me , Baddeley , I am sure ; Sir Thomas wants me , not Miss Price . ”
Maria Bertram	“ There could be no harm in her liking an agreeable man — everybody knew her situation — Mr. Crawford must take care of himself . ”
Maria Bertram	“ Yes , ”
Maria Bertram	“ and her spirits are as good , and she has the same energy of character . I can not but think that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind . ”
Maria Bertram	“ The loss of her ladyship ’s company would be a great drawback , and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too , Miss Price , who had never been at Sotherton yet , and it was a pity she should not see the place . ”
Maria Bertram	“ Oh no ! I can not do without Fanny . ”
Maria Bertram	“ Besides , ”
Maria Bertram	“ I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us . After what passed at first , he would claim it as a promise . ”
Maria Bertram	“ That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford ’s , ”
Maria Bertram	“ but the truth is , that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow , and does not know how to drive . I will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday . ”
Maria Bertram	“ Unpleasant ! ”
Maria Bertram	“ oh dear ! I believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat . There can be no comparison as to one ’s view of the country . Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche - box herself . ”
Maria Bertram	“ It seems very odd , ”
Maria Bertram	“ that you should be staying at home instead of Fanny . ”
Maria Bertram	“ Now , ”
Maria Bertram	“ we are coming to the chapel , which properly we ought to enter from above , and look down upon ; but as we are quite among friends , I will take you in this way , if you will excuse me . ”
Maria Bertram	“ This chapel was fitted up as you see it , in James the Second ’s time . Before that period , as I understand , the pews were only wainscot ; and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth ; but this is not quite certain . It is a handsome chapel , and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening . Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain , within the memory of many ; but the late Mr. Rushworth left it off . ”
Maria Bertram	“ Suppose we turn down here for the present , ”
Maria Bertram	“ Here are the greatest number of our plants , and here are the curious pheasants . ”
Maria Bertram	“ James , ”
Maria Bertram	“ I believe the wilderness will be new to all the party . The Miss Bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet . ”
Maria Bertram	“ I think _ you _ have done pretty well yourself , ma’am . Your lap seems full of good things , and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully . ”
Maria Bertram	“ What else have you been spunging ? ”
Maria Bertram	“ we shall see some happy faces again now . ”
Maria Bertram	“ I believe we must be satisfied with _ less _ , ”
Maria Bertram	“ There would not be time , and other difficulties would arise . We must rather adopt Mr. Crawford ’s views , and make the _ performance _ , not the _ theatre _ , our object . Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery . ”
Maria Bertram	“ What say you now ? Can we be wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same ? ”
Maria Bertram	“ I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done , and ”
Maria Bertram	“ Miss Crawford is to be Amelia . ”
Maria Bertram	“ We see things very differently , ”
Maria Bertram	“ I am perfectly acquainted with the play , I assure you ; and with a very few omissions , and so forth , which will be made , of course , I can see nothing objectionable in it ; and _ I _ am not the _ only _ young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation . ”
Maria Bertram	“ I am much obliged to you , Edmund ; you mean very well , I am sure : but I still think you see things too strongly ; and I really can not undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind . _ There _ would be the greatest indecorum , I think . ”
Maria Bertram	“ If I were to decline the part , ”
Maria Bertram	“ Julia would certainly take it . ”
Maria Bertram	“ One can not wonder , sister , that Fanny _ should _ be delighted : it is all new to her , you know ; you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves , and so am I still ; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure , _ I _ mean to look in at their rehearsals too . What is the play about , Fanny ? you have never told me . ”
Maria Bertram	“ Oh ! sister , pray do not ask her now ; for Fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time . It is about Lovers ’ Vows . ”
Maria Bertram	“ And I do believe she can say every word of it , ”
Maria Bertram	“ for she could put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places . Fanny , I am sure you know the part . ”
Maria Bertram	“ It is time to think of our visitors , ”
Maria Bertram	“ Where did you leave Miss Crawford , Fanny ? ”
Julia Bertram	“ Your best friend upon such an occasion , ”
Julia Bertram	“ would be Mr. Repton , I imagine . ”
Julia Bertram	“ The avenue ! Oh ! I do not recollect it . I really know very little of Sotherton . ”
Julia Bertram	“ I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down , to see the place as it is now , in its old state ; but I do not suppose I shall . ”
Julia Bertram	“ Oh ! it does not signify . Whenever I do see it , you will tell me how it has been altered . ”
Julia Bertram	“ The house was built in Elizabeth ’s time , and is a large , regular , brick building ; heavy , but respectable looking , and has many good rooms . It is ill placed . It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park ; in that respect , unfavourable for improvement . But the woods are fine , and there is a stream , which , I dare say , might be made a good deal of . Mr. Rushworth is quite right , I think , in meaning to give it a modern dress , and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well . ”
Julia Bertram	“ My dear Henry , have _ you _ nothing to say ? You have been an improver yourself , and from what I hear of Everingham , it may vie with any place in England . Its natural beauties , I am sure , are great . Everingham , as it _ used _ to be , was perfect in my estimation : such a happy fall of ground , and such timber ! What would I not give to see it again ! ”
Julia Bertram	“ You are fond of the sort of thing ? ”
Julia Bertram	“ Those who see quickly , will resolve quickly , and act quickly , ”
Julia Bertram	“ _ You _ can never want employment . Instead of envying Mr. Rushworth , you should assist him with your opinion . ”
Julia Bertram	“ I was sure she would ride well , ”
Julia Bertram	“ she has the make for it . Her figure is as neat as her brother ’s . ”
Julia Bertram	“ I must say , ma’am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . ”
Julia Bertram	“ What ! ”
Julia Bertram	“ go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather , when we may have seats in a barouche ! No , my dear Edmund , that will not quite do . ”
Julia Bertram	“ I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you , ”
Julia Bertram	“ her view of the country was charming , she wished they could all see it , ”
Julia Bertram	“ Here is a fine burst of country . I wish you had my seat , but I dare say you will not take it , let me press you ever so much ; ”
Julia Bertram	“ those woods belonged to Sotherton , ”
Julia Bertram	“ she believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth ’s property on each side of the road , ”
Julia Bertram	“ Yes , very likely . They would have two chances at least in their favour . There would be less to distract the attention from without , and it would not be tried so long . ”
Julia Bertram	“ Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria , standing side by side , exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed . Have not they completely the air of it ? ”
Julia Bertram	“ Upon my word , it is really a pity that it should not take place directly , if we had but a proper licence , for here we are altogether , and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant . ”
Julia Bertram	“ If Edmund were but in orders ! ”
Julia Bertram	“ Yes , there is nothing else to be done . But now , sincerely , do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected ? ”
Julia Bertram	“ No , indeed , far otherwise . I find it better , grander , more complete in its style , though that style may not be the best . And to tell you the truth , ”
Julia Bertram	“ I do not think that _ I _ shall ever see Sotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now . Another summer will hardly improve it to me . ”
Julia Bertram	“ You seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning . I was glad to see you so well entertained . You and Julia were laughing the whole way . ”
Julia Bertram	“ You think her more light - hearted than I am ? ”
Julia Bertram	“ Naturally , I believe , I am as lively as Julia , but I have more to think of now . ”
Julia Bertram	“ Heyday ! Where are the others ? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you . ”
Julia Bertram	“ But , Julia , Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key . Do wait for Mr. Rushworth . ”
Julia Bertram	“ I dare say he did , ma’am . Mr. Rushworth is never remiss . But dear Maria has such a strict sense of propriety , so much of that true delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays , Mrs. Rushworth — that wish of avoiding particularity ! Dear ma’am , only look at her face at this moment ; how different from what it was the two last dances ! ”
Julia Bertram	“ Now , Edmund , do not be disagreeable , ”
Julia Bertram	“ Nobody loves a play better than you do , or can have gone much farther to see one . ”
Julia Bertram	“ This is not behaving well by the absent , ”
Julia Bertram	“ Here are not women enough . Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me , but here is nothing for your sister , Mr. Crawford . ”
Julia Bertram	“ You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when I come in with a basket of provisions — though one might have supposed — but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering ! ”
Julia Bertram	“ Do not be afraid of _ my _ wanting the character , ”
Julia Bertram	“ I am _ not _ to be Agatha , and I am sure I will do nothing else ; and as to Amelia , it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me . I quite detest her . An odious , little , pert , unnatural , impudent girl . I have always protested against comedy , and this is comedy in its worst form . ”
Julia Bertram	“ I am sure I would give up the part to Julia most willingly , but that though I shall probably do it very ill , I feel persuaded _ she _ would do it worse , ”
Julia Bertram	“ My father is come ! He is in the hall at this moment . ”
Julia Bertram	“ What will become of us ? what is to be done now ? ”
Julia Bertram	“ _ I _ need not be afraid of appearing before him . ”
William Price	“ because Sir Thomas seemed so ill inclined , and Lady Bertram was so indolent ! ”
William Price	“ I would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than anything else , ”
William Price	“ This is the assembly night , ”
William Price	“ If I were at Portsmouth I should be at it , perhaps . ”
William Price	“ No , Fanny , that I do not . I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of dancing too , when I can not have you . And I do not know that there would be any good in going to the assembly , for I might not get a partner . The Portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a commission . One might as well be nothing as a midshipman . One _ is _ nothing , indeed . You remember the Gregorys ; they are grown up amazing fine girls , but they will hardly speak to _ me _ , because Lucy is courted by a lieutenant . ”
William Price	“ I do not like , William , that you should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence . It would give me pleasure to see you both dance . You spoke of the balls at Northampton . Your cousins have occasionally attended them ; but they would not altogether suit us now . The fatigue would be too much for your aunt . I believe we must not think of a Northampton ball . A dance at home would be more eligible ; and if — ”
William Price	“ Poor Fanny ! ”
William Price	“ how soon she is knocked up ! Why , the sport is but just begun . I hope we shall keep it up these two hours . How can you be tired so soon ? ”
William Price	“ Well , then , Fanny , you shall not get up to - morrow before I go . Sleep as long as you can , and never mind me . ”
William Price	“ What ! Did she think of being up before you set off ? ”
William Price	“ I do not know how it is , ”
William Price	“ but we seem to want some of your nice ways and orderliness at my father ’s . The house is always in confusion . You will set things going in a better way , I am sure . You will tell my mother how it all ought to be , and you will be so useful to Susan , and you will teach Betsey , and make the boys love and mind you . How right and comfortable it will all be ! ”
William Price	“ You are just in time . We have been looking for you this half - hour . The Thrush went out of harbour this morning . I saw her . It was a beautiful sight . And they think she will have her orders in a day or two . And Mr. Campbell was here at four o’clock to ask for you : he has got one of the Thrush ’s boats , and is going off to her at six , and hoped you would be here in time to go with him . ”
William Price	began—“Ha ! welcome back , my boy . Glad to see you . Have you heard the news ? The Thrush went out of harbour this morning . Sharp is the word , you see ! By G — , you are just in time ! The doctor has been here inquiring for you : he has got one of the boats , and is to be off for Spithead by six , so you had better go with him . I have been to Turner ’s about your mess ; it is all in a way to be done . I should not wonder if you had your orders to - morrow : but you can not sail with this wind , if you are to cruise to the westward ; and Captain Walsh thinks you will certainly have a cruise to the westward , with the Elephant . By G — , I wish you may ! But old Scholey was saying , just now , that he thought you would be sent first to the Texel . Well , well , we are ready , whatever happens . But by G — , you lost a fine sight by not being here in the morning to see the Thrush go out of harbour ! I would not have been out of the way for a thousand pounds . Old Scholey ran in at breakfast - time , to say she had slipped her moorings and was coming out , I jumped up , and made but two steps to the platform . If ever there was a perfect beauty afloat , she is one ; and there she lays at Spithead , and anybody in England would take her for an eight - and - twenty . I was upon the platform two hours this afternoon looking at her . She lays close to the Endymion , between her and the Cleopatra , just to the eastward of the sheer hulk . ”
William Price	“ Ha ! ”
William Price	“ _ that ’s _ just where I should have put her myself . It ’s the best berth at Spithead . But here is my sister , sir ; here is Fanny , ”
William Price	“ it is so dark you do not see her . ”
William Price	“ Take care of Fanny , mother . She is tender , and not used to rough it like the rest of us . I charge you , take care of Fanny . ”
William Price	“ Come , girls ; come , Fan ; come , Sue , take care of yourselves ; keep a sharp lookout ! ”
William Price	“ It might be all a lie , ”
William Price	“ but so many fine ladies were going to the devil nowadays that way , that there was no answering for anybody . ”
Lady Bertram	“ What if they were among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter , a girl now nine years old , of an age to require more attention than her poor mother could possibly give ? The trouble and expense of it to them would be nothing , compared with the benevolence of the action . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Where shall the child come to first , sister , to you or to us ? ”
Lady Bertram	“ Then she had better come to us , ”
Lady Bertram	“ I hope she will not tease my poor pug , ”
Lady Bertram	“ I have but just got Julia to leave it alone . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Is she not to live with you ? I thought you had settled it with Sir Thomas . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Indeed , I do not know . I suppose he thought it best . ”
Lady Bertram	“ No ; he only said he thought it very likely ; and I thought so too . We both thought it would be a comfort to you . But if you do not like it , there is no more to be said . She is no encumbrance here . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone ? ”
Lady Bertram	“ I dare say you will . You always do , do n’t you ? ”
Lady Bertram	“ You are very good , but do not trouble yourself about them . They are sure of being well provided for . Sir Thomas will take care of that . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Oh ! _ that _ will soon be settled . Sir Thomas has been writing about it , I know . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Fanny must have a horse , ”
Lady Bertram	“ If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to return , it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria well married , ”
Lady Bertram	“ Mr. Rushworth , ”
Lady Bertram	“ if I were you , I would have a very pretty shrubbery . One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Very well — very much . I like to hear her talk . She entertains me ; and she is so extremely pretty , that I have great pleasure in looking at her . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Oh yes ! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did . I was quite astonished . An uncle with whom she has been living so many years , and who , whatever his faults may be , is so very fond of her brother , treating him , they say , quite like a son . I could not have believed it ! ”
Lady Bertram	“ And very ungrateful , I think . ”
Lady Bertram	“ She has got it , ”
Lady Bertram	“ she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time . ”
Lady Bertram	“ I was afraid it would be too much for her , ”
Lady Bertram	“ but when the roses were gathered , your aunt wished to have them , and then you know they must be taken home . ”
Lady Bertram	“ But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice ? ”
Lady Bertram	“ No ; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry ; and , unluckily , Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key , so she was obliged to go again . ”
Lady Bertram	“ I am afraid it was , indeed , ”
Lady Bertram	“ I am very much afraid she caught the headache there , for the heat was enough to kill anybody . It was as much as I could bear myself . Sitting and calling to Pug , and trying to keep him from the flower - beds , was almost too much for me . ”
Lady Bertram	“ but _ this _ I _ will _ maintain , that we shall be doing no harm . ”
Lady Bertram	“ And I am convinced to the contrary . Nobody is fonder of the exercise of talent in young people , or promotes it more , than my father , and for anything of the acting , spouting , reciting kind , I think he has always a decided taste . I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys . How many a time have we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar , and to _ be’d _ and not _ to _ _ be’d _ , in this very room , for his amusement ? And I am sure , _ my _ _ name _ _ was _ _ Norval _ , every evening of my life through one Christmas holidays . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Do not act anything improper , my dear , ”
Lady Bertram	“ Sir Thomas would not like it.—Fanny , ring the bell ; I must have my dinner.—To be sure , Julia is dressed by this time . ”
Lady Bertram	“ I must really congratulate your ladyship , ”
Lady Bertram	“ on the play being chosen ; for though you have borne it with exemplary patience , I am sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties . The actors may be glad , but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision ; and I do sincerely give you joy , madam , as well as Mrs. Norris , and everybody else who is in the same predicament , ”
Lady Bertram	“ But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny ? ”
Lady Bertram	“ How came she to think of asking Fanny ? Fanny never dines there , you know , in this sort of way . I can not spare her , and I am sure she does not want to go . Fanny , you do not want to go , do you ? ”
Lady Bertram	“ I can not imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her ? She never did before . She used to ask your sisters now and then , but she never asked Fanny . ”
Lady Bertram	“ But my mother will have my father with her all the evening . ”
Lady Bertram	“ To be sure , so I shall . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Suppose you take my father ’s opinion , ma’am . ”
Lady Bertram	“ That ’s well thought of . So I will , Edmund . I will ask Sir Thomas , as soon as he comes in , whether I can do without her . ”
Lady Bertram	“ As you please , ma’am , on that head ; but I meant my father ’s opinion as to the _ propriety _ of the invitation ’s being accepted or not ; and I think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant , as well as by Fanny , that being the _ first _ invitation it should be accepted . ”
Lady Bertram	“ I do not know . We will ask him . But he will be very much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all . ”
Lady Bertram	with—“I have something to tell you that will surprise you . Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Edmund wants her to go . But how can I spare her ? ”
Lady Bertram	“ Dear me ! how disagreeable ! I wonder anybody can ever go to sea . ”
Lady Bertram	“ that she was not at all afraid of the trouble ; indeed , she could not imagine there would be any . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Yes , ”
Lady Bertram	“ she looks very well . I sent Chapman to her . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Yes , she does look very well , ”
Lady Bertram	“ She could not recollect what it was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes , or what it was that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny : she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finest young man in the room — somebody had whispered something to her ; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Yes , yes ; very well ; did you ? did he ? I did not see _ that _ ; I should not know one from the other . ”
Lady Bertram	“ I can not think what is the matter with me , ”
Lady Bertram	“ I feel quite stupid . It must be sitting up so late last night . Fanny , you must do something to keep me awake . I can not work . Fetch the cards ; I feel so very stupid . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Yes , ”
Lady Bertram	“ but I wish he was not going away . They are all going away , I think . I wish they would stay at home . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Yes ”
Lady Bertram	“ Sir Thomas , I have been thinking — and I am very glad we took Fanny as we did , for now the others are away we feel the good of it . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Yes , ”
Lady Bertram	“ and it is a comfort to think that we shall always have _ her _ . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Let Sir Thomas know ”
Lady Bertram	“ I am glad you gave him something considerable , ”
Lady Bertram	“ for _ I _ gave him only £ 10 . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Sir Thomas told me £ 10 would be enough . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Well , Fanny , ”
Lady Bertram	“ Well , Fanny , I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning . I must just speak of it _ once _ , I told Sir Thomas I must _ once _ , and then I shall have done . I give you joy , my dear niece . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Humph , we certainly are a handsome family ! ”
Lady Bertram	“ I will tell you what , Fanny , ”
Lady Bertram	“ I am sure he fell in love with you at the ball ; I am sure the mischief was done that evening . You did look remarkably well . Everybody said so . Sir Thomas said so . And you know you had Chapman to help you to dress . I am very glad I sent Chapman to you . I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that evening . ”
Lady Bertram	“ And I will tell you what , Fanny , which is more than I did for Maria : the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy . ”
Lady Bertram	“ It was really like being at a play , ”
Lady Bertram	“ I wish Sir Thomas had been here . ”
Lady Bertram	“ That may be , sister , ”
Lady Bertram	“ I dare say you are very right ; but I am sure I shall miss her very much . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Dear Fanny ! now I shall be comfortable . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Yes , indeed , Edmund , ”
Lady Bertram	“ Fanny has been cutting roses , has she ? ”
Lady Bertram	“ What is the matter ? ”
Lady Bertram	“ I was not asleep . ”
Lady Bertram	“ Very well , ”
Lady Bertram	“ then speculation , if you please , Mrs. Grant . I know nothing about it , but Fanny must teach me . ”
Lady Bertram	“ You have a great turn for acting , I am sure , Mr. Crawford , ”
Lady Bertram	“ and I will tell you what , I think you will have a theatre , some time or other , at your house in Norfolk . I mean when you are settled there . I do indeed . I think you will fit up a theatre at your house in Norfolk . ”
Lady Bertram	“ This distressing intelligence , as you may suppose , ”
Lady Bertram	“ has agitated us exceedingly , and we can not prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive for the poor invalid , whose state Sir Thomas fears may be very critical ; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother immediately , but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on this distressing occasion , as it would be too trying for me . We shall greatly miss Edmund in our small circle , but I trust and hope he will find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be apprehended , and that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield shortly , which Sir Thomas proposes should be done , and thinks best on every account , and I flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able to bear the removal without material inconvenience or injury . As I have little doubt of your feeling for us , my dear Fanny , under these distressing circumstances , I will write again very soon . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ I wish you could see Compton , ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ it is the most complete thing ! I never saw a place so altered in my life . I told Smith I did not know where I was . The approach _ now _ , is one of the finest things in the country : you see the house in the most surprising manner . I declare , when I got back to Sotherton yesterday , it looked like a prison — quite a dismal old prison . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ It wants improvement , ma’am , beyond anything . I never saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life ; and it is so forlorn that I do not know what can be done with it . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ I must try to do something with it , ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ but I do not know what . I hope I shall have some good friend to help me . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ Smith ’s place is the admiration of all the country ; and it was a mere nothing before Repton took it in hand . I think I shall have Repton . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ They desired me to stay — my cousin Maria charged me to say that you would find them at that knoll , or thereabouts . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ I do not believe I shall go any farther , ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ I see nothing of them . By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere else . I have had walking enough . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ I think they might as well have staid for me , ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ Miss Bertram thought you would follow her . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ I should not have had to follow her if she had staid . ”
Mr. Rushworth	on—“Pray , Miss Price , are you such a great admirer of this Mr. Crawford as some people are ? For my part , I can see nothing in him . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ I do not think him at all handsome . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ Handsome ! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome . He is not five foot nine . I should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight . I think he is an ill - looking fellow . In my opinion , these Crawfords are no addition at all . We did very well without them . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key , there might have been some excuse , but I went the very moment she said she wanted it . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ Well , ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ if you really think I had better go : it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ We have got a play , ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ It is to be Lovers ’ Vows ; and I am to be Count Cassel , and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak , and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit , by way of a shooting - dress . I do not know how I shall like it . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ I come in three times , and have two - and - forty speeches . That ’s something , is not it ? But I do not much like the idea of being so fine . I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ I had my choice of the parts , ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ but I thought I should like the Count best , though I do not much relish the finery I am to have . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ _ The _ _ Count _ has two - and - forty speeches , ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ which is no trifle . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches , ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ what would you do with such a part as mine ? I have forty - two to learn . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ Do you think there is anything so very fine in all this ? For the life and soul of me , I can not admire him ; and , between ourselves , to see such an undersized , little , mean - looking man , set up for a fine actor , is very ridiculous in my opinion . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ Shall I go too ? Had not I better go too ? Will not it be right for me to go too ? ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ I do not say he is not gentleman - like , considering ; but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight , or he will be expecting a well - looking man . ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ If I must say what I think , ”
Mr. Rushworth	“ in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing . It is having too much of a good thing . I am not so fond of acting as I was at first . I think we are a great deal better employed , sitting comfortably here among ourselves , and doing nothing . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ And now , ”
Mrs. Grant	“ I have thought of something to make it complete . I should dearly love to settle you both in this country ; and therefore , Henry , you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram , a nice , handsome , good - humoured , accomplished girl , who will make you very happy . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ I pay very little regard , ”
Mrs. Grant	“ to what any young person says on the subject of marriage . If they profess a disinclination for it , I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ Oh yes ! I am not at all ashamed of it . I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly : I do not like to have people throw themselves away ; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present , ”
Mrs. Grant	“ The truth is , ma’am , ”
Mrs. Grant	“ As there are five of you , it will be better that one should sit with Henry ; and as you were saying lately that you wished you could drive , Julia , I think this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry , ”
Mrs. Grant	“ Both ! no , no , that must not be . Do not give him a hint of it . Think of Mr. Rushworth ! ”
Mrs. Grant	“ I dare say he _ will _ be in parliament soon . When Sir Thomas comes , I dare say he will be in for some borough , but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing anything yet . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ You will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family , I assure you . I do not think we do so well without him . He has a fine dignified manner , which suits the head of such a house , and keeps everybody in their place . Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home ; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order . But , Mary , do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry . I am sure _ Julia _ does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends , I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ If you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ Dr. Grant is ill , ”
Mrs. Grant	“ He has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today . He fancied it tough , sent away his plate , and has been suffering ever since ”
Mrs. Grant	“ My sister and Mr. Bertram . I am so glad your eldest cousin is gone , that he may be Mr. Bertram again . There is something in the sound of Mr. _ Edmund _ Bertram so formal , so pitiful , so younger - brother - like , that I detest it . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ They can not have been sitting long , ”
Mrs. Grant	“ for when I went up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window , and then they were walking . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ And you know what your dinner will be , ”
Mrs. Grant	smiling—“the turkey , and I assure you a very fine one ; for , my dear , ”
Mrs. Grant	“ cook insists upon the turkey ’s being dressed to - morrow . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game . ”
Mrs. Grant	“ Oh dear , yes ! very entertaining indeed . A very odd game . I do not know what it is all about . I am never to see my cards ; and Mr. Crawford does all the rest . ”
Susan Price	“ I was upstairs , mama , moving my things , ”
Susan Price	“ You know you had but just settled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room ; and I could not get Rebecca to give me any help . ”
Susan Price	“ It was very hard that she was not to have her _ own _ knife ; it was her own knife ; little sister Mary had left it to her upon her deathbed , and she ought to have had it to keep herself long ago . But mama kept it from her , and was always letting Betsey get hold of it ; and the end of it would be that Betsey would spoil it , and get it for her own , though mama had _ promised _ her that Betsey should not have it in her own hands . ”
Mr. Yates	“ A trifling part , ”
Mr. Yates	“ and not at all to my taste , and such a one as I certainly would not accept again ; but I was determined to make no difficulties . Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two characters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford ; and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign his to me , it was impossible to take it , you know . I was sorry for _ him _ that he should have so mistaken his powers , for he was no more equal to the Baron — a little man with a weak voice , always hoarse after the first ten minutes . It must have injured the piece materially ; but _ I _ was resolved to make no difficulties . Sir Henry thought the duke not equal to Frederick , but that was because Sir Henry wanted the part himself ; whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two . I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick . Luckily the strength of the piece did not depend upon him . Our Agatha was inimitable , and the duke was thought very great by many . And upon the whole , it would certainly have gone off wonderfully . ”
Mr. Yates	“ I do think you were very much to be pitied , ”
Mr. Yates	“ It is not worth complaining about ; but to be sure the poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time ; and it is impossible to help wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days we wanted . It was but three days ; and being only a grandmother , and all happening two hundred miles off , I think there would have been no great harm , and it was suggested , I know ; but Lord Ravenshaw , who I suppose is one of the most correct men in England , would not hear of it . ”
Mr. Yates	“ Oh , quite enough , ”
Mr. Yates	“ with only just a side wing or two run up , doors in flat , and three or four scenes to be let down ; nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this . For mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more . ”
Mr. Yates	“ Cottager ’s wife ! ”
Mr. Yates	“ What are you talking of ? The most trivial , paltry , insignificant part ; the merest commonplace ; not a tolerable speech in the whole . Your sister do that ! It is an insult to propose it . At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it . We all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else . A little more justice , Mr. Manager , if you please . You do not deserve the office , if you can not appreciate the talents of your company a little better . ”
Mr. Yates	“ Yes , ”
Mr. Yates	“ After all our debatings and difficulties , we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well , nothing so unexceptionable , as Lovers ’ Vows . The wonder is that it should not have been thought of before . My stupidity was abominable , for here we have all the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford ; and it is so useful to have anything of a model ! We have cast almost every part . ”
Mr. Yates	“ Your _ brother _ should take the part , ”
Mr. Yates	“ Do not you think he would ? ”
Mr. Yates	“ To own the truth , Sir Thomas , we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening . We were going through the three first acts , and not unsuccessfully upon the whole . Our company is now so dispersed , from the Crawfords being gone home , that nothing more can be done to - night ; but if you will give us the honour of your company to - morrow evening , I should not be afraid of the result . We bespeak your indulgence , you understand , as young performers ; we bespeak your indulgence . ”
Mrs. Price	“ Poor dears ! how tired you must both be ! and now , what will you have ? I began to think you would never come . Betsey and I have been watching for you this half - hour . And when did you get anything to eat ? And what would you like to have now ? I could not tell whether you would be for some meat , or only a dish of tea , after your journey , or else I would have got something ready . And now I am afraid Campbell will be here before there is time to dress a steak , and we have no butcher at hand . It is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street . We were better off in our last house . Perhaps you would like some tea as soon as it can be got . ”
Mrs. Price	“ Her year ! ”
Mrs. Price	“ I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her before she has staid a year , for that will not be up till November . Servants are come to such a pass , my dear , in Portsmouth , that it is quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year . I have no hope of ever being settled ; and if I was to part with Rebecca , I should only get something worse . And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress to please ; and I am sure the place is easy enough , for there is always a girl under her , and I often do half the work myself . ”
Mrs. Price	“ Now , Susan , ”
Mrs. Price	“ now , how can you be so cross ? You are always quarrelling about that knife . I wish you would not be so quarrelsome . Poor little Betsey ; how cross Susan is to you ! But you should not have taken it out , my dear , when I sent you to the drawer . You know I told you not to touch it , because Susan is so cross about it . I must hide it another time , Betsey . Poor Mary little thought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep , only two hours before she died . Poor little soul ! she could but just speak to be heard , and she said so prettily , ‘ Let sister Susan have my knife , mama , when I am dead and buried . ’ Poor little dear ! she was so fond of it , Fanny , that she would have it lay by her in bed , all through her illness . It was the gift of her good godmother , old Mrs. Admiral Maxwell , only six weeks before she was taken for death . Poor little sweet creature ! Well , she was taken away from evil to come . My own Betsey ”
Mrs. Price	“ _ you _ have not the luck of such a good godmother . Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little people as you . ”
Mrs. Price	“ Would she not , then , persuade her daughters to take advantage of such weather , and allow him the pleasure of attending them ? ”
Mrs. Price	“ Her daughters were very much confined ; Portsmouth was a sad place ; they did not often get out ; and she knew they had some errands in the town , which they would be very glad to do . ”
Mrs. Price	“ My poor sister Bertram must be in a great deal of trouble . ”
Mrs. Price	“ Indeed , I hope it is not true , ”
Mrs. Price	“ it would be so very shocking ! If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that carpet , I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times ; have not I , Betsey ? And it would not be ten minutes ’ work . ”
Dr. Grant	“ My dear brother , I will not believe this of you . ”
Dr. Grant	“ There , Mrs. Grant , you see how he dwells on one word , and only look at his smile . I assure you he is very detestable ; the Admiral ’s lessons have quite spoiled him . ”
Dr. Grant	“ The tree thrives well , beyond a doubt , madam , ”
Dr. Grant	“ The soil is good ; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering . ”
Dr. Grant	“ Sir , it is a Moor Park , we bought it as a Moor Park , and it cost us — that is , it was a present from Sir Thomas , but I saw the bill — and I know it cost seven shillings , and was charged as a Moor Park . ”
Dr. Grant	“ You were imposed on , ma’am , ”
Dr. Grant	“ these potatoes have as much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree . It is an insipid fruit at the best ; but a good apricot is eatable , which none from my garden are . ”
Dr. Grant	“ Very well , very well , ”
Dr. Grant	“ all the better ; I am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house . But Miss Price and Mr. Edmund Bertram , I dare say , would take their chance . We none of us want to hear the bill of fare . A friendly meeting , and not a fine dinner , is all we have in view . A turkey , or a goose , or a leg of mutton , or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us . ”
