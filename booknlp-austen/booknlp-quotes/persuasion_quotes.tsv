Anne Elliot	""" The navy , I think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give . Sailors work hard enough for their comforts , we must all allow . """
Anne Elliot	""" The profession has its utility , but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it . """
Anne Elliot	""" Indeed ! """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes ; it is in two points offensive to me ; I have two strong grounds of objection to it . First , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man 's youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man . I have observed it all my life . A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line . One day last spring , in town , I was in company with two men , striking instances of what I am talking of ; Lord St Ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; I was to give place to Lord St Ives , and a certain Admiral Baldwin , the most deplorable - looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top . ` In the name of heaven , who is that old fellow ? ' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( Sir Basil Morley ) . ` Old fellow ! ' cried Sir Basil , ` it is Admiral Baldwin . What do you take his age to be ? ' ` Sixty , ' said I , ` or perhaps sixty - two . ' ` Forty , ' replied Sir Basil , ` forty , and no more . ' Picture to yourselves my amazement ; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin . I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea - faring life can do ; but to a degree , I know it is the same with them all : they are all knocked about , and exposed to every climate , and every weather , till they are not fit to be seen . It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once , before they reach Admiral Baldwin 's age . """
Anne Elliot	"clergyman;--""and even the clergyman , you know is obliged to go into infected rooms , and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere . In fact , as I have long been convinced , though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn , it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any , who can live in a regular way , in the country , choosing their own hours , following their own pursuits , and living on their own property , without the torment of trying for more ; it is only their lot , I say , to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost : I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young . """
Anne Elliot	""" He is a rear admiral of the white . He was in the Trafalgar action , and has been in the East Indies since ; he was stationed there , I believe , several years . """
Anne Elliot	""" You mean Mr Wentworth , I suppose ? """
Anne Elliot	""" A few months more , and he , perhaps , may be walking here . """
Anne Elliot	""" There is hardly any personal defect , """
Anne Elliot	""" which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to . """
Anne Elliot	""" a fine girl . """
Anne Elliot	""" So , you are come at last ! I began to think I should never see you . I am so ill I can hardly speak . I have not seen a creature the whole morning ! """
Anne Elliot	""" I am sorry to find you unwell , """
Anne Elliot	""" You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday ! """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes , I made the best of it ; I always do : but I was very far from well at the time ; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning : very unfit to be left alone , I am sure . Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way , and not able to ring the bell ! So , Lady Russell would not get out . I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer . """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! Charles is out shooting . I have not seen him since seven o'clock . He would go , though I told him how ill I was . He said he should not stay out long ; but he has never come back , and now it is almost one . I assure you , I have not seen a soul this whole long morning . """
Anne Elliot	""" You have had your little boys with you ? """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes , as long as I could bear their noise ; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good . Little Charles does not mind a word I say , and Walter is growing quite as bad . """
Anne Elliot	""" Well , you will soon be better now , """
Anne Elliot	""" You know I always cure you when I come . How are your neighbours at the Great House ? """
Anne Elliot	""" I can give you no account of them . I have not seen one of them to - day , except Mr Musgrove , who just stopped and spoke through the window , but without getting off his horse ; and though I told him how ill I was , not one of them have been near me . It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves , I suppose , and they never put themselves out of their way . """
Anne Elliot	""" You will see them yet , perhaps , before the morning is gone . It is early . """
Anne Elliot	""" I never want them , I assure you . They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me . Oh ! Anne , I am so very unwell ! It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday . """
Anne Elliot	""" My dear Mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself ! You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner . """
Anne Elliot	""" Dear me ! what can you possibly have to do ? """
Anne Elliot	""" A great many things , I assure you . More than I can recollect in a moment ; but I can tell you some . I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father 's books and pictures . I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie , trying to understand , and make him understand , which of Elizabeth 's plants are for Lady Russell . I have had all my own little concerns to arrange , books and music to divide , and all my trunks to repack , from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons : and one thing I have had to do , Mary , of a more trying nature : going to almost every house in the parish , as a sort of take - leave . I was told that they wished it . But all these things took up a great deal of time . """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! well ! """
Anne Elliot	""" but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday . """
Anne Elliot	""" Did you go then ? I have made no enquiries , because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party . """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh yes ! I went . I was very well yesterday ; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning . It would have been strange if I had not gone . """
Anne Elliot	""" I am very glad you were well enough , and I hope you had a pleasant party . """
Anne Elliot	""" Nothing remarkable . One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one 's own . Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me , and we were so crowded ! They are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward . So , there was I , crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louise ; and I think it very likely that my illness to - day may be owing to it . """
Anne Elliot	""" Where shall we go ? """
Anne Elliot	""" I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you ? """
Anne Elliot	""" I have not the smallest objection on that account , """
Anne Elliot	""" I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves . """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible . They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister . However , we may as well go and sit with them a little while , and when we have that over , we can enjoy our walk . """
Anne Elliot	""" Charles spoils the children so that I can not get them into any order , """
Anne Elliot	""" Very true . """
Anne Elliot	""" Altered beyond his knowledge . """
Anne Elliot	""" So altered that he should not have known her again ! """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! Frederick ! But I can not believe it of you . --All idle refinement ! --Women may be as comfortable on board , as in the best house in England . I believe I have lived as much on board as most women , and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man - of - war . I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me , even at Kellynch Hall , """
Anne Elliot	""" beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in ; and they have been five altogether . """
Anne Elliot	""" But you , yourself , brought Mrs Harville , her sister , her cousin , and three children , round from Portsmouth to Plymouth . Where was this superfine , extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then ? """
Anne Elliot	""" Depend upon it , they were all perfectly comfortable . """
Anne Elliot	""" My dear Frederick , you are talking quite idly . Pray , what would become of us poor sailors ' wives , who often want to be conveyed to one port or another , after our husbands , if everybody had your feelings ? """
Anne Elliot	""" But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman , and as if women were all fine ladies , instead of rational creatures . We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days . """
Anne Elliot	""" Ay , that we shall . """
Anne Elliot	""" I beg your pardon , madam , this is your seat ; """
Anne Elliot	""" They are up stairs with my sister : they will be down in a few moments , I dare say , """
Anne Elliot	""" How do you do ? Will you not sit down ? The others will be here presently . """
Anne Elliot	""" Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop ? """
Anne Elliot	""" And yet , """
Anne Elliot	""" he has not , perhaps , a more sorrowing heart than I have . I can not believe his prospects so blighted for ever . He is younger than I am ; younger in feeling , if not in fact ; younger as a man . He will rally again , and be happy with another . """
Anne Elliot	""" These would have been all my friends , """
Anne Elliot	""" No , """
Anne Elliot	""" that I can easily believe to be impossible ; but in time , perhaps -- we know what time does in every case of affliction , and you must remember , Captain Harville , that your friend may yet be called a young mourner -- only last summer , I understand . """
Anne Elliot	""" only June . """
Anne Elliot	""" Not till the first week of August , when he came home from the Cape , just made into the Grappler . I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him ; he sent in letters , but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth . There the news must follow him , but who was to tell it ? not I. I would as soon have been run up to the yard - arm . Nobody could do it , but that good fellow """
Anne Elliot	""" The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before ; no danger of her being sent to sea again . He stood his chance for the rest ; wrote up for leave of absence , but without waiting the return , travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth , rowed off to the Grappler that instant , and never left the poor fellow for a week . That 's what he did , and nobody else could have saved poor James . You may think , Miss Elliot , whether he is dear to us ! """
Anne Elliot	""" Go to him , go to him , """
Anne Elliot	""" for heaven 's sake go to him . I can support her myself . Leave me , and go to him . Rub her hands , rub her temples ; here are salts ; take them , take them . """
Anne Elliot	""" A surgeon ! """
Anne Elliot	""" True , true , a surgeon this instant , """
Anne Elliot	""" Captain Benwick , would not it be better for Captain Benwick ? He knows where a surgeon is to be found . """
Anne Elliot	""" It was what she had been thinking of , and wishing to be allowed to do . A bed on the floor in Louisa 's room would be sufficient for her , if Mrs Harville would but think so . """
Anne Elliot	""" What should they do without her ? They were wretched comforters for one another . """
Anne Elliot	""" I must call on Mrs Croft ; I really must call upon her soon . Anne , have you courage to go with me , and pay a visit in that house ? It will be some trial to us both . """
Anne Elliot	""" I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two ; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine . By remaining in the neighbourhood , I am become inured to it . """
Anne Elliot	""" These rooms ought to belong only to us . Oh , how fallen in their destination ! How unworthily occupied ! An ancient family to be so driven away ! Strangers filling their place ! """
Anne Elliot	""" There we differ , Mary , """
Anne Elliot	""" I think Lady Russell would like him . I think she would be so much pleased with his mind , that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner . """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! when shall I leave you again ? """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! yes , perhaps , it had been Mr Elliot . They did not know . It might be him , perhaps . """
Anne Elliot	""" My idea of good company , Mr Elliot , is the company of clever , well - informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what I call good company . """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes , """
Anne Elliot	""" we shall , indeed , be known to be related to them ! """
Anne Elliot	""" I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance . I suppose """
Anne Elliot	""" I have more pride than any of you ; but I confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them . """
Anne Elliot	""" Pardon me , dear cousin , you are unjust in your own claims . In London , perhaps , in your present quiet style of living , it might be as you say : but in Bath ; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing : always acceptable as acquaintance . """
Anne Elliot	""" Well , """
Anne Elliot	""" I certainly am proud , too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place . """
Anne Elliot	""" I can easily believe it . Women of that class have great opportunities , and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to . Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing ! And it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting . What instances must pass before them of ardent , disinterested , self - denying attachment , of heroism , fortitude , patience , resignation : of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most . A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes . """
Anne Elliot	""" She sees nothing to blame in it , """
Anne Elliot	""" on the contrary , she approves it , and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs Smith ."
Anne Elliot	""" Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man , and in many respects I think highly of him , """
Anne Elliot	""" but we should not suit . """
Anne Elliot	""" Louisa . """
Anne Elliot	""" Ay , ay , Miss Louisa Musgrove , that is the name . I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names . I should never be out if they were all Sophys , or something of that sort . Well , this Miss Louisa , we all thought , you know , was to marry Frederick . He was courting her week after week . The only wonder was , what they could be waiting for , till the business at Lyme came ; then , indeed , it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right . But even then there was something odd in their way of going on . Instead of staying at Lyme , he went off to Plymouth , and then he went off to see Edward . When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward 's , and there he has been ever since . We have seen nothing of him since November . Even Sophy could not understand it . But now , the matter has take the strangest turn of all ; for this young lady , the same Miss Musgrove , instead of being to marry Frederick , is to marry James Benwick . You know James Benwick . """
Anne Elliot	""" A little . I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick . """
Anne Elliot	""" Well , she is to marry him . Nay , most likely they are married already , for I do not know what they should wait for . """
Anne Elliot	""" I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man , """
Anne Elliot	""" and I understand that he bears an excellent character . """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! yes , yes , there is not a word to be said against James Benwick . He is only a commander , it is true , made last summer , and these are bad times for getting on , but he has not another fault that I know of . An excellent , good - hearted fellow , I assure you ; a very active , zealous officer too , which is more than you would think for , perhaps , for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice . """
Anne Elliot	""" Indeed you are mistaken there , sir ; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick 's manners . I thought them particularly pleasing , and I will answer for it , they would generally please . """
Anne Elliot	""" Well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality , Sophy and I can not help thinking Frederick 's manners better than his . There is something about Frederick more to our taste . """
Anne Elliot	""" I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends , """
Anne Elliot	""" I hope , Admiral , I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth 's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy . It did seem , last autumn , as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove ; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally , and without violence . I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill - used man . """
Anne Elliot	""" Not at all , not at all ; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end . """
Anne Elliot	""" No , no ; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that . If the girl likes another man better , it is very fit she should have him . """
Anne Elliot	""" Certainly . But what I mean is , that I hope there is nothing in Captain Wentworth 's manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill - used by his friend , which might appear , you know , without its being absolutely said . I should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be destroyed , or even wounded , by a circumstance of this sort . """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes , yes , I understand you . But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter . He does not give the least fling at Benwick ; does not so much as say , ` I wonder at it , I have a reason of my own for wondering at it . ' No , you would not guess , from his way of writing , that he had ever thought of this Miss ( what 's her name ? ) for himself . He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together ; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that , I think . """
Anne Elliot	""" I am much obliged to you , """
Anne Elliot	""" but I am not going with them . The carriage would not accommodate so many . I walk : I prefer walking . """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! very little , Nothing that I regard . """
Anne Elliot	""" I am only waiting for Mr Elliot . He will be here in a moment , I am sure . """
Anne Elliot	""" Good morning to you ! """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! no , that is clear enough . One can guess what will happen there . He is always with them ; half lives in the family , I believe . What a very good - looking man ! """
Anne Elliot	""" She is pretty , I think ; Anne Elliot ; very pretty , when one comes to look at her . It is not the fashion to say so , but I confess I admire her more than her sister . """
Anne Elliot	""" And so do I. No comparison . But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot . Anne is too delicate for them . """
Anne Elliot	""" Now , how would she speak of him ? """
Anne Elliot	""" You will wonder , """
Anne Elliot	""" what has been fixing my eye so long ; but I was looking after some window - curtains , which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night . They described the drawing - room window - curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way , and this part of the street , as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath , but could not recollect the exact number , and I have been trying to find out which it could be ; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description . """
Anne Elliot	""" How do you do ? """
Anne Elliot	""" You were a good while at Lyme , I think ? """
Anne Elliot	""" About a fortnight . I could not leave it till Louisa 's doing well was quite ascertained . I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace . It had been my doing , solely mine . She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak . The country round Lyme is very fine . I walked and rode a great deal ; and the more I saw , the more I found to admire . """
Anne Elliot	""" I should very much like to see Lyme again , """
Anne Elliot	""" Indeed ! I should not have supposed that you could have found anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling . The horror and distress you were involved in , the stretch of mind , the wear of spirits ! I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust . """
Anne Elliot	""" The last hours were certainly very painful , """
Anne Elliot	""" but when pain is over , the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure . One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it , unless it has been all suffering , nothing but suffering , which was by no means the case at Lyme . We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours , and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment . So much novelty and beauty ! I have travelled so little , that every fresh place would be interesting to me ; but there is real beauty at Lyme ; and in short """
Anne Elliot	""" altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable . """
Anne Elliot	""" This , """
Anne Elliot	""" is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an Italian love - song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give ; for I do not pretend to understand the language . I am a very poor Italian scholar . """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes , yes , I see you are . I see you know nothing of the matter . You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted , transposed , curtailed Italian lines , into clear , comprehensible , elegant English . You need not say anything more of your ignorance . Here is complete proof . """
Anne Elliot	""" I will not oppose such kind politeness ; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient . """
Anne Elliot	""" For shame ! for shame ! this is too much flattery . I forget what we are to have next , """
Anne Elliot	""" Is not this song worth staying for ? """
Anne Elliot	""" The little Durands were there , I conclude , """
Anne Elliot	""" with their mouths open to catch the music , like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed . They never miss a concert . """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes ; I did not see them myself , but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in the room . """
Anne Elliot	""" The Ibbotsons , were they there ? and the two new beauties , with the tall Irish officer , who is talked of for one of them . """
Anne Elliot	""" I do not know . I do not think they were . """
Anne Elliot	""" Old Lady Mary Maclean ? I need not ask after her . She never misses , I know ; and you must have seen her . She must have been in your own circle ; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple , you were in the seats of grandeur , round the orchestra , of course . """
Anne Elliot	""" No , that was what I dreaded . It would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect . But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be farther off ; and we were exceedingly well placed , that is , for hearing ; I must not say for seeing , because I appear to have seen very little . """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! you saw enough for your own amusement . I can understand . There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd , and this you had . You were a large party in yourselves , and you wanted nothing beyond . """
Anne Elliot	""" But I ought to have looked about me more , """
Anne Elliot	""" No , no ; you were better employed . You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening . I see it in your eye . I perfectly see how the hours passed : that you had always something agreeable to listen to . In the intervals of the concert it was conversation . """
Anne Elliot	""" Do you see that in my eye ? """
Anne Elliot	""" Mr Elliot ! """
Anne Elliot	""" Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot ? """
Anne Elliot	""" I was not at all aware of this . You never mentioned it before . Had I known it , I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you . """
Anne Elliot	""" I should be extremely happy ; I hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you , """
Anne Elliot	""" but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case . I am sure you have , somehow or other , imbibed such a notion . You must consider me only as Mr Elliot 's relation . If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me . """
Anne Elliot	""" No , """
Anne Elliot	""" nor next week , nor next , nor next . I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week . I am not going to marry Mr Elliot . I should like to know why you imagine I am ? """
Anne Elliot	""" No , """
Anne Elliot	""" I can readily believe all that of my cousin . He seems to have a calm decided temper , not at all open to dangerous impressions . I consider him with great respect . I have no reason , from any thing that has fallen within my observation , to do otherwise . But I have not known him long ; and he is not a man , I think , to be known intimately soon . Will not this manner of speaking of him , Mrs Smith , convince you that he is nothing to me ? Surely this must be calm enough . And , upon my word , he is nothing to me . Should he ever propose to me ( which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing ) , I shall not accept him . I assure you I shall not . I assure you , Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing , in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford : not Mr Elliot ; it is not Mr Elliot that-- """
Anne Elliot	""" The whole history , """
Anne Elliot	""" She could not make a very long history , I think , of one such little article of unfounded news . """
Anne Elliot	""" But , """
Anne Elliot	""" though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot , I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could . Shall I mention to him your being in Bath ? Shall I take any message ? """
Anne Elliot	""" I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years ? """
Anne Elliot	""" Not before he was married , I suppose ? """
Anne Elliot	""" And -- were you much acquainted ? """
Anne Elliot	""" Indeed ! Then do tell me what he was at that time of life . I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man . Was he at all such as he appears now ? """
Anne Elliot	""" My expressions startle you . You must allow for an injured , angry woman . But I will try to command myself . I will not abuse him . I will only tell you what I have found him . Facts shall speak . He was the intimate friend of my dear husband , who trusted and loved him , and thought him as good as himself . The intimacy had been formed before our marriage . I found them most intimate friends ; and I , too , became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot , and entertained the highest opinion of him . At nineteen , you know , one does not think very seriously ; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others , and much more agreeable than most others , and we were almost always together . We were principally in town , living in very good style . He was then the inferior in circumstances ; he was then the poor one ; he had chambers in the Temple , and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman . He had always a home with us whenever he chose it ; he was always welcome ; he was like a brother . My poor Charles , who had the finest , most generous spirit in the world , would have divided his last farthing with him ; and I know that his purse was open to him ; I know that he often assisted him . """
Anne Elliot	""" This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot 's life , """
Anne Elliot	""" which has always excited my particular curiosity . It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister . I never knew him myself ; I only heard of him ; but there was a something in his conduct then , with regard to my father and sister , and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage , which I never could quite reconcile with present times . It seemed to announce a different sort of man . """
Anne Elliot	""" Nay , """
Anne Elliot	""" I have no particular enquiry to make about her . I have always understood they were not a happy couple . But I should like to know why , at that time of his life , he should slight my father 's acquaintance as he did . My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him . Why did Mr Elliot draw back ? """
Anne Elliot	""" Perhaps , """
Anne Elliot	""" you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot ? """
Anne Elliot	""" This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night , """
Anne Elliot	""" This explains it . I found he had been used to hear of me . I could not comprehend how . What wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned ! How sure to be mistaken ! But I beg your pardon ; I have interrupted you . Mr Elliot married then completely for money ? The circumstances , probably , which first opened your eyes to his character . """
Anne Elliot	""" Indeed , my dear Mrs Smith , I want none , """
Anne Elliot	""" You have asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago . This is all in confirmation , rather , of what we used to hear and believe . I am more curious to know why he should be so different now . """
Anne Elliot	""" Thank you . This is full proof undoubtedly ; proof of every thing you were saying . But why be acquainted with us now ? """
Anne Elliot	""" Can you really ? """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes . I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago , and I will shew him as he is now . I can not produce written proof again , but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire , of what he is now wanting , and what he is now doing . He is no hypocrite now . He truly wants to marry you . His present attentions to your family are very sincere : quite from the heart . I will give you my authority : his friend Colonel Wallis . """
Anne Elliot	""" Colonel Wallis ! you are acquainted with him ? """
Anne Elliot	""" No . It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that ; it takes a bend or two , but nothing of consequence . The stream is as good as at first ; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away . Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his views on you , which said Colonel Wallis , I imagine to be , in himself , a sensible , careful , discerning sort of character ; but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife , to whom he tells things which he had better not , and he repeats it all to her . She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery , repeats it all to her nurse ; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you , very naturally brings it all to me . On Monday evening , my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings . When I talked of a whole history , therefore , you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed . """
Anne Elliot	""" My dear Mrs Smith , your authority is deficient . This will not do . Mr Elliot 's having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father . That was all prior to my coming to Bath . I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived . """
Anne Elliot	""" I know you did ; I know it all perfectly , but-- """
Anne Elliot	""" Indeed , Mrs Smith , we must not expect to get real information in such a line . Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many , to be misconceived by folly in one , and ignorance in another , can hardly have much truth left . """
Anne Elliot	""" Only give me a hearing . You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due , by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm . Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement . He had seen you indeed , before he came to Bath , and admired you , but without knowing it to be you . So says my historian , at least . Is this true ? Did he see you last summer or autumn , ` somewhere down in the west , ' to use her own words , without knowing it to be you ? """
Anne Elliot	""" He certainly did . So far it is very true . At Lyme . I happened to be at Lyme . """
Anne Elliot	""" This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family , long before you returned to it ; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it , though he did not then visit in Camden Place ; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there , and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two , as he happened to do a little before Christmas , Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things , and the reports beginning to prevail . Now you are to understand , that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot 's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy . Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man . Having long had as much money as he could spend , nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence , he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to . I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased , but it is now a confirmed feeling . He can not bear the idea of not being Sir William . You may guess , therefore , that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable , and you may guess what it produced ; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible , and of fixing himself here for a time , with the view of renewing his former acquaintance , and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger , and of circumventing the lady if he found it material . This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done ; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could . He was to be introduced , and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced , and everybody was to be introduced . Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re - admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ) , to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject . You can imagine what an artful man would do ; and with this guide , perhaps , may recollect what you have seen him do . """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes , """
Anne Elliot	""" you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known , or could imagine . There is always something offensive in the details of cunning . The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting , but I have heard nothing which really surprises me . I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot , who would have difficulty in believing it ; but I have never been satisfied . I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared . I should like to know his present opinion , as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of ; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not . """
Anne Elliot	""" I am very glad to know all this , """
Anne Elliot	""" It will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him , but I shall know better what to do . My line of conduct will be more direct . Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous , artificial , worldly man , who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness . """
Anne Elliot	""" Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove """
Anne Elliot	""" I am extremely glad , indeed , """
Anne Elliot	""" particularly glad that this should happen ; and that of two sisters , who both deserve equally well , and who have always been such good friends , the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other-- that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort . I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both . """
Anne Elliot	""" Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove , """
Anne Elliot	""" should be happy in their children 's marriages . They do everything to confer happiness , I am sure . What a blessing to young people to be in such hands ! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ? """
Anne Elliot	""" That can not be much to your taste , I know , """
Anne Elliot	""" but I do believe him to be an excellent young man . """
Anne Elliot	""" Surely , if there be constant attachment on each side , our hearts must understand each other ere long . We are not boy and girl , to be captiously irritable , misled by every moment 's inadvertence , and wantonly playing with our own happiness . """
Anne Elliot	""" No , """
Anne Elliot	""" it can not be Mr Elliot , I assure you . He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to - morrow . """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes , it is Mr Elliot , certainly . He has changed his hour of going , I suppose , that is all , or I may be mistaken , I might not attend ; """
Anne Elliot	""" If it depended only on my inclination , ma'am , the party at home ( excepting on Mary 's account ) would not be the smallest impediment . I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you . But , it had better not be attempted , perhaps . """
Anne Elliot	""" I am not yet so much changed , """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! dear ! very true . Only think , Miss Elliot , to my great surprise I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street . I was never more astonished . He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard . He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return . He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to - morrow . He was full of ` to - morrow , ' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head . """
Anne Elliot	""" No , """
Anne Elliot	""" That I can easily believe . """
Anne Elliot	""" It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved . """
Anne Elliot	""" Yes . We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us . It is , perhaps , our fate rather than our merit . We can not help ourselves . We live at home , quiet , confined , and our feelings prey upon us . You are forced on exertion . You have always a profession , pursuits , business of some sort or other , to take you back into the world immediately , and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions . """
Anne Elliot	""" True , """
Anne Elliot	""" very true ; I did not recollect ; but what shall we say now , Captain Harville ? If the change be not from outward circumstances , it must be from within ; it must be nature , man 's nature , which has done the business for Captain Benwick . """
Anne Elliot	""" Your feelings may be the strongest , """
Anne Elliot	""" but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender . Man is more robust than woman , but he is not longer lived ; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments . Nay , it would be too hard upon you , if it were otherwise . You have difficulties , and privations , and dangers enough to struggle with . You are always labouring and toiling , exposed to every risk and hardship . Your home , country , friends , all quitted . Neither time , nor health , nor life , to be called your own . It would be hard , indeed """
Anne Elliot	""" if woman 's feelings were to be added to all this . """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! """
Anne Elliot	""" I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you . God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow - creatures ! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman . No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as -- if I may be allowed the expression -- so long as you have an object . I mean while the woman you love lives , and lives for you . All the privilege I claim for my own sex ( it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it ) , is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone . """
Anne Elliot	""" I am afraid , ma'am , that it is not perfectly understood . Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening . I am afraid there had been some mistake ; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth , that we hope to see them both . """
Anne Elliot	""" Oh ! my dear , it is quite understood , I give you my word . Captain Harville has no thought but of going . """
Anne Elliot	""" Do you think so ? But I am afraid ; and I should be so very sorry . Will you promise me to mention it , when you see them again ? You will see them both this morning , I dare say . Do promise me . """
Anne Elliot	""" To be sure I will , if you wish it . Charles , if you see Captain Harville anywhere , remember to give Miss Anne 's message . But indeed , my dear , you need not be uneasy . Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged , I 'll answer for it ; and Captain Wentworth the same , I dare say . """
Anne Elliot	""" You should have distinguished , """
Anne Elliot	""" You should not have suspected me now ; the case is so different , and my age is so different . If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once , remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety , not of risk . When I yielded , I thought it was to duty , but no duty could be called in aid here . In marrying a man indifferent to me , all risk would have been incurred , and all duty violated . """
Anne Elliot	""" I should have thought , """
Anne Elliot	""" that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this . """
Anne Elliot	""" No , no ! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give . I left you in this belief ; and yet , I was determined to see you again . My spirits rallied with the morning , and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here . """
Anne Elliot	""" I have been thinking over the past , and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong , I mean with regard to myself ; and I must believe that I was right , much as I suffered from it , that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now . To me , she was in the place of a parent . Do not mistake me , however . I am not saying that she did not err in her advice . It was , perhaps , one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides ; and for myself , I certainly never should , in any circumstance of tolerable similarity , give such advice . But I mean , that I was right in submitting to her , and that if I had done otherwise , I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up , because I should have suffered in my conscience . I have now , as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature , nothing to reproach myself with ; and if I mistake not , a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman 's portion . """
Captain Wentworth	""" The Admiralty , """
Captain Wentworth	""" entertain themselves now and then , with sending a few hundred men to sea , in a ship not fit to be employed . But they have a great many to provide for ; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not , it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed . """
Captain Wentworth	""" I felt my luck , Admiral , I assure you ; """
Captain Wentworth	""" I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire . It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea ; a very great object , I wanted to be doing something . """
Captain Wentworth	""" To be sure you did . What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together ? If a man had not a wife , he soon wants to be afloat again . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Now I have done , """
Captain Wentworth	""" When once married people begin to attack me with,--`Oh ! you will think very differently , when you are married . ' I can only say , ` No , I shall not ; ' and then they say again , ` Yes , you will , ' and there is an end of it . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Oh , no ; never ; she has quite given up dancing . She had rather play . She is never tired of playing . """
Captain Wentworth	""" I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here : Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here , """
Captain Wentworth	""" I hope the little boy is better , """
Captain Wentworth	""" What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister ! They meant to take a long drive this morning ; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills . They talked of coming into this side of the country . I wonder whereabouts they will upset to - day . Oh ! it does happen very often , I assure you ; but my sister makes nothing of it ; she would as lieve be tossed out as not . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Do you mean that she refused him ? """
Captain Wentworth	""" Oh ! yes ; certainly . """
Captain Wentworth	""" When did that happen ? """
Captain Wentworth	""" I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary . I wish she had accepted him . We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell 's doing , that she did not . They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell , and that therefore , she persuaded Anne to refuse him . """
Captain Wentworth	""" That man is struck with you , and even I , at this moment , see something like Anne Elliot again . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Ah ! """
Captain Wentworth	""" it is the very man we passed . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Pray , """
Captain Wentworth	""" can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away ? """
Captain Wentworth	""" Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together , """
Captain Wentworth	""" we must consider it to be the arrangement of Providence , that you should not be introduced to your cousin . """
Captain Wentworth	""" I am determined I will : """
Captain Wentworth	""" Is there no one to help me ? """
Captain Wentworth	""" Oh God ! her father and mother ! """
Captain Wentworth	""" Had not she better be carried to the inn ? Yes , I am sure : carry her gently to the inn . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Yes , yes , to the inn , """
Captain Wentworth	""" I will carry her myself . Musgrove , take care of the others . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Thank God ! """
Captain Wentworth	""" We must be decided , and without the loss of another minute . Every minute is valuable . Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly . Musgrove , either you or I must go . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Then it is settled , Musgrove , """
Captain Wentworth	""" that you stay , and that I take care of your sister home . But as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist Mrs Harville , I think it need be only one . Mrs Charles Musgrove will , of course , wish to get back to her children ; but if Anne will stay , no one so proper , so capable as Anne . """
Captain Wentworth	""" You will stay , I am sure ; you will stay and nurse her ; """
Captain Wentworth	""" I have been considering what we had best do . She must not appear at first . She could not stand it . I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her , while I go in and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove . Do you think this is a good plan ? """
Captain Wentworth	""" Now , this must be very bad for you , """
Captain Wentworth	""" to be coming and finding us here . I had not recollected it before , I declare , but it must be very bad . But now , do not stand upon ceremony . Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Well , whenever it suits you . You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time ; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door . A good place is not it ? But , """
Captain Wentworth	""" you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler 's room . Ay , so it always is , I believe . One man 's ways may be as good as another 's , but we all like our own best . And so you must judge for yourself , whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not . """
Captain Wentworth	""" But it rains . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Though I came only yesterday , I have equipped myself properly for Bath already , you see , """
Captain Wentworth	""" I wish you would make use of it , if you are determined to walk ; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair . """
Captain Wentworth	""" they should meet again . He would look for her , he would find her out before the evening were over , and at present , perhaps , it was as well to be asunder . She was in need of a little interval for recollection . """
Captain Wentworth	""" He must wish her good night ; he was going ; he should get home as fast as he could . """
Captain Wentworth	""" No ! """
Captain Wentworth	""" there is nothing worth my staying for ; """
Captain Wentworth	""" You have not been long enough in Bath , """
Captain Wentworth	""" to enjoy the evening parties of the place . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Oh ! no . The usual character of them has nothing for me . I am no card - player . """
Captain Wentworth	""" You were not formerly , I know . You did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes . """
Captain Wentworth	""" It is a period , indeed ! Eight years and a half is a period . """
Captain Wentworth	""" We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Certainly : Captain Benwick . """
Captain Wentworth	""" he is writing about it now . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Poor Fanny ! she would not have forgotten him so soon ! """
Captain Wentworth	""" It was not in her nature . She doted on him . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men ( which , however , I do not think I shall grant ) , it does not apply to Benwick . He has not been forced upon any exertion . The peace turned him on shore at the very moment , and he has been living with us , in our little family circle , ever since . """
Captain Wentworth	""" No , no , it is not man 's nature . I will not allow it to be more man 's nature than woman 's to be inconstant and forget those they do love , or have loved . I believe the reverse . I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental ; and that as our bodies are the strongest , so are our feelings ; capable of bearing most rough usage , and riding out the heaviest weather . """
Captain Wentworth	""" There is no hurry on my side . I am only ready whenever you are . I am in very good anchorage here , """
Captain Wentworth	""" well supplied , and want for nothing . No hurry for a signal at all . Well , Miss Elliot , """
Captain Wentworth	""" as I was saying we shall never agree , I suppose , upon this point . No man and woman , would , probably . But let me observe that all histories are against you -- all stories , prose and verse . If I had such a memory as Benwick , I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument , and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman 's inconstancy . Songs and proverbs , all talk of woman 's fickleness . But perhaps you will say , these were all written by men . """
Captain Wentworth	""" But how shall we prove anything ? """
Captain Wentworth	""" Yes , """
Captain Wentworth	""" very true ; here we separate , but Harville and I shall soon be after you ; that is , Harville , if you are ready , I am in half a minute . I know you will not be sorry to be off . I shall be at your service in half a minute . """
Captain Wentworth	""" Miss A. E.-- , """
Captain Wentworth	""" I hardly know , """
William Elliot	""" must lament his being very much under - hung , a defect which time seemed to have increased ; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse . Mr Elliot appeared to think that he ( Sir Walter ) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted ; """
William Elliot	""" a most charming woman , quite worthy of being known in Camden Place , """
William Elliot	""" he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before , """
William Elliot	""" The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty , """
William Elliot	""" as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing , are more absurd , I believe , than those of any other set of beings in the world . The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view . """
William Elliot	""" an accident , """
William Elliot	""" Family connexions were always worth preserving , good company always worth seeking ; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house , for three months , in Laura Place , and would be living in style . She had been at Bath the year before , and Lady Russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman . It was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed , if it could be done , without any compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots . """
William Elliot	""" You are mistaken , """
William Elliot	""" that is not good company ; that is the best . Good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice . Birth and good manners are essential ; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company ; on the contrary , it will do very well . My cousin Anne shakes her head . She is not satisfied . She is fastidious . My dear cousin """
William Elliot	""" you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman I know ; but will it answer ? Will it make you happy ? Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place , and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible ? You may depend upon it , that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter , and as rank is rank , your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family ( our family let me say ) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for . """
William Elliot	""" I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long , """
William Elliot	""" without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot ; and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments , and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman . """
William Elliot	""" Perhaps , """
William Elliot	""" I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of . """
William Elliot	""" Indeed ! How so ? You can have been acquainted with it only since I came to Bath , excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family . """
William Elliot	""" I knew you by report long before you came to Bath . I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately . I have been acquainted with you by character many years . Your person , your disposition , accomplishments , manner ; they were all present to me . """
William Elliot	""" No , no , some time or other , perhaps , but not now . He would mention no names now ; but such , he could assure her , had been the fact . He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her . """
William Elliot	""" The name of Anne Elliot , """
William Elliot	""" has long had an interesting sound to me . Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy ; and , if I dared , I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change . """
Charles Musgrove	""" So , Miss Anne , Sir Walter and your sister are gone ; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in ? """
Charles Musgrove	""" I could manage them very well , if it were not for Mary 's interference , """
Charles Musgrove	""" I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill , """
Charles Musgrove	""" Oh ! Miss Anne , I can not help wishing Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children . They are quite different creatures with you ! But to be sure , in general they are so spoilt ! It is a pity you can not put your sister in the way of managing them . They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen , poor little dears ! without partiality ; but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated-- ! Bless me ! how troublesome they are sometimes . I assure you , Miss Anne , it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should . I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; """
Charles Musgrove	""" and """
Charles Musgrove	""" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them . """
Charles Musgrove	""" I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter - in - law 's concerns , for I know it would not do ; but I shall tell you , Miss Anne , because you may be able to set things to rights , that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles 's nursery - maid : I hear strange stories of her ; she is always upon the gad ; and from my own knowledge , I can declare , she is such a fine - dressing lady , that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near . Mrs Charles quite swears by her , I know ; but I just give you this hint , that you may be upon the watch ; because , if you see anything amiss , you need not be afraid of mentioning it . """
Charles Musgrove	""" the child was going on so well , and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth , that , perhaps , he might join them in the evening ; he would not dine from home , but he might walk in for half an hour . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Oh ! no , indeed , Charles , I can not bear to have you go away . Only think if anything should happen ? """
Charles Musgrove	""" Nothing can be going on better than the child , """
Charles Musgrove	""" so I told my father , just now , that I would come , and he thought me quite right . Your sister being with you , my love , I have no scruple at all . You would not like to leave him yourself , but you see I can be of no use . Anne will send for me if anything is the matter . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Ah ! Miss Anne , if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son , I dare say he would have been just such another by this time . """
Charles Musgrove	""" And so then , I suppose , """
Charles Musgrove	""" so then he went away to the Laconia , and there he met with our poor boy . Charles , my dear , """
Charles Musgrove	""" do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother . I always forgot . """
Charles Musgrove	""" It was at Gibraltar , mother , I know . Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar , with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Oh ! but , Charles , tell Captain Wentworth , he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me , for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend . """
Charles Musgrove	""" And I am sure , Sir . """
Charles Musgrove	""" it was a lucky day for us , when you were put captain into that ship . We shall never forget what you did . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Poor dear fellow ! """
Charles Musgrove	""" he was grown so steady , and such an excellent correspondent , while he was under your care ! Ah ! it would have been a happy thing , if he had never left you . I assure you , Captain Wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you . """
Charles Musgrove	""" What a great traveller you must have been , ma'am ! """
Charles Musgrove	""" Pretty well , ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage ; though many women have done more . I have crossed the Atlantic four times , and have been once to the East Indies , and back again , and only once ; besides being in different places about home : Cork , and Lisbon , and Gibraltar . But I never went beyond the Streights , and never was in the West Indies . We do not call Bermuda or Bahama , you know , the West Indies . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Aye , to be sure . Yes , indeed , oh yes ! I am quite of your opinion , Mrs Croft , """
Charles Musgrove	""" There is nothing so bad as a separation . I am quite of your opinion . I know what it is , for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes , and I am so glad when they are over , and he is safe back again . """
Charles Musgrove	""" No ! """
Charles Musgrove	""" Anne , Anne , """
Charles Musgrove	""" What is to be done next ? What , in heaven 's name , is to be done next ? """
Charles Musgrove	""" Well , mother , I have done something for you that you will like . I have been to the theatre , and secured a box for to - morrow night . A'n't I a good boy ? I know you love a play ; and there is room for us all . It holds nine . I have engaged Captain Wentworth . Anne will not be sorry to join us , I am sure . We all like a play . Have not I done well , mother ? """
Charles Musgrove	""" Phoo ! phoo ! """
Charles Musgrove	""" what 's an evening party ? Never worth remembering . Your father might have asked us to dinner , I think , if he had wanted to see us . You may do as you like , but I shall go to the play . """
Charles Musgrove	""" No , I did not promise . I only smirked and bowed , and said the word ` happy . ' There was no promise . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Do n't talk to me about heirs and representatives , """
Charles Musgrove	""" I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun . If I would not go for the sake of your father , I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir . What is Mr Elliot to me ? """
Charles Musgrove	""" We had better put it off . Charles , you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday . It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father 's ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us . """
Charles Musgrove	""" And so , ma'am , all these thing considered , """
Charles Musgrove	""" though we could have wished it different , yet , altogether , we did not think it fair to stand out any longer , for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it , and Henrietta was pretty near as bad ; and so we thought they had better marry at once , and make the best of it , as many others have done before them . At any rate , said I , it will be better than a long engagement . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Oh ! dear Mrs Croft , """
Charles Musgrove	""" there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement . It is what I always protested against for my children . It is all very well , I used to say , for young people to be engaged , if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months , or even in twelve ; but a long engagement-- """
Charles Musgrove	""" By all means , my dear , """
Charles Musgrove	""" go home directly , and take care of yourself , that you may be fit for the evening . I wish Sarah was here to doctor you , but I am no doctor myself . Charles , ring and order a chair . She must not walk . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Captain Wentworth , which way are you going ? Only to Gay Street , or farther up the town ? """
Charles Musgrove	""" Are you going as high as Belmont ? Are you going near Camden Place ? Because , if you are , I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place , and give Anne your arm to her father 's door . She is rather done for this morning , and must not go so far without help , and I ought to be at that fellow 's in the Market Place . He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off ; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment , that I might see it ; and if I do not turn back now , I have no chance . By his description , a good deal like the second size double - barrel of mine , which you shot with one day round Winthrop . """
Charles Musgrove	""" I found , """
Charles Musgrove	""" that I was considered by Harville an engaged man ! That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment . I was startled and shocked . To a degree , I could contradict this instantly ; but , when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same -- her own family , nay , perhaps herself -- I was no longer at my own disposal . I was hers in honour if she wished it . I had been unguarded . I had not thought seriously on this subject before . I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways ; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls , at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report , were there no other ill effects . I had been grossly wrong , and must abide the consequences . """
Charles Musgrove	""" had never seen a pleasanter man in his life ; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say , was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war . Here was a fortune at once ; besides which , there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war ; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy . Oh ! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Walter , """
Charles Musgrove	""" why do you not do as you are bid ? Do not you hear your aunt speak ? Come to me , Walter , come to cousin Charles . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Oh ! Captain Benwick is very well , I believe , but he is a very odd young man . I do not know what he would be at . We asked him to come home with us for a day or two : Charles undertook to give him some shooting , and he seemed quite delighted , and , for my part , I thought it was all settled ; when behold ! on Tuesday night , he made a very awkward sort of excuse ; ` he never shot ' and he had ` been quite misunderstood , ' and he had promised this and he had promised that , and the end of it was , I found , that he did not mean to come . I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull ; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart - broken man as Captain Benwick . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Now Mary , you know very well how it really was . It was all your doing , """
Charles Musgrove	""" He fancied that if he went with us , he should find you close by : he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross ; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off , his heart failed him , and he had not courage to come . That is the fact , upon my honour , Mary knows it is . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Oh ! he talks of you , """
Charles Musgrove	""" No , """
Charles Musgrove	""" I do not know that he ever does , in a general way ; but however , it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly . His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation , and he wants to talk to you about them ; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks -- oh ! I can not pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine -- I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it ; and then ` Miss Elliot ' was spoken of in the highest terms ! Now Mary , I declare it was so , I heard it myself , and you were in the other room . ` Elegance , sweetness , beauty . ' Oh ! there was no end of Miss Elliot 's charms . """
Charles Musgrove	""" And that you are very likely to do very soon , I can tell you , ma'am , """
Charles Musgrove	""" Though he had not nerves for coming away with us , and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here , he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself , you may depend on it . I told him the distance and the road , and I told him of the church 's being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , I thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon . So , I give you notice , Lady Russell . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Well , as your joint acquaintance , then , I shall be very happy to see Captain Benwick . """
Charles Musgrove	""" So do I , Anne , """
Charles Musgrove	""" I am sure Lady Russell would like him . He is just Lady Russell 's sort . Give him a book , and he will read all day long . """
Charles Musgrove	""" And a very good living it was , """
Charles Musgrove	""" only five - and - twenty miles from Uppercross , and in a very fine country : fine part of Dorsetshire . In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom , surrounded by three great proprietors , each more careful and jealous than the other ; and to two of the three at least , Charles Hayter might get a special recommendation . Not that he will value it as he ought , """
Charles Musgrove	""" Charles is too cool about sporting . That 's the worst of him . """
Charles Musgrove	""" Oh ! yes . My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer , but he has no other fault to find . Money , you know , coming down with money -- two daughters at once -- it can not be a very agreeable operation , and it streightens him as to many things . However , I do not mean to say they have not a right to it . It is very fit they should have daughters ' shares ; and I am sure he has always been a very kind , liberal father to me . Mary does not above half like Henrietta 's match . She never did , you know . But she does not do him justice , nor think enough about Winthrop . I can not make her attend to the value of the property . It is a very fair match , as times go ; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life , and I shall not leave off now . """
Mary Musgrove	""" I can not possibly do without Anne , """
Mary Musgrove	""" Upon my word , I shall be pretty well off , when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath ! """
Mary Musgrove	""" I do believe if Charles were to see me dying , he would not think there was anything the matter with me . I am sure , Anne , if you would , you might persuade him that I really am very ill -- a great deal worse than I ever own . """
Mary Musgrove	""" I hate sending the children to the Great House , though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them , for she humours and indulges them to such a degree , and gives them so much trash and sweet things , that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day . """
Mary Musgrove	""" Dear me , is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch ? I am glad I did not think of it before . How low it makes me ! """
Mary Musgrove	""" Nobody knew how much she should suffer . She should put it off as long as she could ; """
Mary Musgrove	""" Are you serious ? """
Mary Musgrove	""" Dear me ! that 's a very good thought , very good , indeed . To be sure , I may just as well go as not , for I am of no use at home -- am I ? and it only harasses me . You , who have not a mother 's feelings , are a great deal the properest person . You can make little Charles do anything ; he always minds you at a word . It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima . Oh ! I shall certainly go ; I am sure I ought if I can , quite as much as Charles , for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth , and I know you do not mind being left alone . An excellent thought of yours , indeed , Anne . I will go and tell Charles , and get ready directly . You can send for us , you know , at a moment 's notice , if anything is the matter ; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you . I should not go , you may be sure , if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child . """
Mary Musgrove	""" I mean to go with you , Charles , for I am of no more use at home than you are . If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child , I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like . Anne will stay ; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him . It is Anne 's own proposal , and so I shall go with you , which will be a great deal better , for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday . """
Mary Musgrove	""" It is over ! it is over ! """
Mary Musgrove	""" The worst is over ! """
Mary Musgrove	""" Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you , Anne , though he was so attentive to me . Henrietta asked him what he thought of you , when they went away , and he said , ` You were so altered he should not have known you again . ' """
Mary Musgrove	""" Upon my word it would , """
Mary Musgrove	""" Dear me ! If he should rise to any very great honours ! If he should ever be made a baronet ! ` Lady Wentworth ' sounds very well . That would be a noble thing , indeed , for Henrietta ! She would take place of me then , and Henrietta would not dislike that . Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth ! It would be but a new creation , however , and I never think much of your new creations . """
Mary Musgrove	""" You know , """
Mary Musgrove	""" I can not think him at all a fit match for Henrietta ; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made , she has no right to throw herself away . I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family , and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them . And , pray , who is Charles Hayter ? Nothing but a country curate . A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross . """
Mary Musgrove	""" Charles may say what he pleases , """
Mary Musgrove	""" but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter ; a very bad thing for her , and still worse for me ; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head , and I have very little doubt that he has . She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday . I wish you had been there to see her behaviour . And as to Captain Wentworth 's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta , it is nonsense to say so ; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best . But Charles is so positive ! I wish you had been with us yesterday , for then you might have decided between us ; and I am sure you would have thought as I did , unless you had been determined to give it against me . """
Mary Musgrove	""" Oh , yes , I should like to join you very much , I am very fond of a long walk ; """
Mary Musgrove	""" I can not imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk , """
Mary Musgrove	""" Everybody is always supposing that I am not a good walker ; and yet they would not have been pleased , if we had refused to join them . When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us , how can one say no ? """
Mary Musgrove	""" Bless me ! here is Winthrop . I declare I had no idea ! Well now , I think we had better turn back ; I am excessively tired . """
Mary Musgrove	""" It is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life . """
Mary Musgrove	""" Bless me ! """
Mary Musgrove	""" it must be our cousin ; it must be our Mr Elliot , it must , indeed ! Charles , Anne , must not it ? In mourning , you see , just as our Mr Elliot must be . How very extraordinary ! In the very same inn with us ! Anne , must not it be our Mr Elliot ? my father 's next heir ? Pray sir , """
Mary Musgrove	""" did not you hear , did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynch family ? """
Mary Musgrove	""" No , ma'am , he did not mention no particular family ; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman , and would be a baronight some day . """
Mary Musgrove	""" There ! you see ! """
Mary Musgrove	""" just as I said ! Heir to Sir Walter Elliot ! I was sure that would come out , if it was so . Depend upon it , that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish , wherever he goes . But , Anne , only conceive how extraordinary ! I wish I had looked at him more . I wish we had been aware in time , who it was , that he might have been introduced to us . What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other ! Do you think he had the Elliot countenance ? I hardly looked at him , I was looking at the horses ; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance , I wonder the arms did not strike me ! Oh ! the great - coat was hanging over the panel , and hid the arms , so it did ; otherwise , I am sure , I should have observed them , and the livery too ; if the servant had not been in mourning , one should have known him by the livery . """
Mary Musgrove	""" Of course , """
Mary Musgrove	""" you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot , the next time you write to Bath . I think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him . """
Mary Musgrove	""" She is dead ! she is dead ! """
Mary Musgrove	""" in such terms-- """
Mary Musgrove	""" I declare , Charles , I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there . I declare , Anne , he never talks of you at all . """
Mary Musgrove	""" And I am sure , """
Mary Musgrove	""" it was a very little to his credit , if he did . Miss Harville only died last June . Such a heart is very little worth having ; is it , Lady Russell ? I am sure you will agree with me . """
Mary Musgrove	""" Oh ! as to being Anne 's acquaintance , """
Mary Musgrove	""" I think he is rather my acquaintance , for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight . """
Mary Musgrove	""" You will not find anything very agreeable in him , I assure you , ma'am . He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived . He has walked with me , sometimes , from one end of the sands to the other , without saying a word . He is not at all a well - bred young man . I am sure you will not like him . """
Mary Musgrove	""" Yes , that he will ! """
Mary Musgrove	""" He will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drop 's one 's scissors , or anything that happens . Do you think Lady Russell would like that ? """
Mary Musgrove	""" Anne , """
Mary Musgrove	""" there is Mrs Clay , I am sure , standing under the colonnade , and a gentleman with her . I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now . They seemed deep in talk . Who is it ? Come , and tell me . Good heavens ! I recollect . It is Mr Elliot himself . """
Mary Musgrove	""" Do come , Anne """
Mary Musgrove	""" come and look yourself . You will be too late if you do not make haste . They are parting ; they are shaking hands . He is turning away . Not know Mr Elliot , indeed ! You seem to have forgot all about Lyme . """
Mary Musgrove	""" Good heavens , Charles ! how can you think of such a thing ? Take a box for to - morrow night ! Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to - morrow night ? and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter , and Mr Elliot , and all the principal family connexions , on purpose to be introduced to them ? How can you be so forgetful ? """
Mary Musgrove	""" Oh ! Charles , I declare it will be too abominable if you do , when you promised to go . """
Mary Musgrove	""" But you must go , Charles . It would be unpardonable to fail . We were asked on purpose to be introduced . There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves . Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately . We are quite near relations , you know ; and Mr Elliot too , whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with ! Every attention is due to Mr Elliot . Consider , my father 's heir : the future representative of the family . """
Mary Musgrove	""" Only think of Elizabeth 's including everybody ! """
Mary Musgrove	""" I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted ! You see he can not put the card out of his hand . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL ."
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Married , December 16 , 1810 , Charles , son and heir of Charles Musgrove , Esq . of Uppercross , in the county of Somerset , """
Sir Walter Elliot	"motto:--""Principal seat , Kellynch Hall , in the county of Somerset , """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Heir presumptive , William Walter Elliot , Esq . , great grandson of the second Sir Walter . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" For they must have been seen together , """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" once at Tattersall 's , and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" He would be a very lucky man , Shepherd , """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" that 's all I have to remark . A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him ; rather the greatest prize of all , let him have taken ever so many before ; hey , Shepherd ? """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" There are few among the gentlemen of the navy , I imagine , who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant . I have known a good deal of the profession ; and besides their liberality , they are so neat and careful in all their ways ! These valuable pictures of yours , Sir Walter , if you chose to leave them , would be perfectly safe . Everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of ! The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now . You need not be afraid , Miss Elliot , of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" As to all that , """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" supposing I were induced to let my house , I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it . I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant . The park would be open to him of course , and few navy officers , or men of any other description , can have had such a range ; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure - grounds , is another thing . I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable ; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden . I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour , I assure you , be he sailor or soldier . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" And who is Admiral Croft ? """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Then I take it for granted , """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" You ought to have minded me , Walter ; I told you not to teaze your aunt ; """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" not been able to return the compliment entirely , which had embarrassed him . He did not mean to complain , however . Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men , and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" How is Mary looking ? """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" The last time I saw her she had a red nose , but I hope that may not happen every day . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Oh ! no , that must have been quite accidental . In general she has been in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , I would send her a new hat and pelisse . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" A knock at the door ! and so late ! It was ten o'clock . Could it be Mr Elliot ? They knew he was to dine in Lansdown Crescent . It was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did . They could think of no one else . Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot 's knock . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret ; """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" our cousins , the Dalrymples , """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Westgate Buildings ! """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be visiting in Westgate Buildings ? A Mrs Smith . A widow Mrs Smith ; and who was her husband ? One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere . And what is her attraction ? That she is old and sickly . Upon my word , Miss Anne Elliot , you have the most extraordinary taste ! Everything that revolts other people , low company , paltry rooms , foul air , disgusting associations are inviting to you . But surely you may put off this old lady till to - morrow : she is not so near her end , I presume , but that she may hope to see another day . What is her age ? Forty ? """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement , """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Sir Henry Russell 's widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot . A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings ! A poor widow barely able to live , between thirty and forty ; a mere Mrs Smith , an every - day Mrs Smith , of all people and all names in the world , to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot , and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland ! Mrs Smith ! Such a name ! """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" What is this ? """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" The Crofts have arrived in Bath ? The Crofts who rent Kellynch ? What have they brought you ? """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Oh ! those letters are convenient passports . They secure an introduction . I should have visited Admiral Croft , however , at any rate . I know what is due to my tenant . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Gout and decrepitude ! """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Poor old gentleman . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" I suspect , """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall . Elizabeth , may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place ? """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Oh , no ! I think not . Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple , cousins , we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve . If we were not related , it would not signify ; but as cousins , she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours . We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level . There are several odd - looking men walking about here , who , I am told , are sailors . The Crofts will associate with them . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" A well - looking man , """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" a very well - looking man . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" No , I just know his name . A bowing acquaintance . Wentworth ; Captain Wentworth of the navy . His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire , the Croft , who rents Kellynch . """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" And mine , """
Sir Walter Elliot	""" Kindest regards . And you may say , that I mean to call upon her soon . Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card . Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life , who make themselves up so little . If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen ; but last time I called , I observed the blinds were let down immediately . """
Mrs. Smith	""" And she , """
Mrs. Smith	""" besides nursing me most admirably , has really proved an invaluable acquaintance . As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit , which has been a great amusement ; and she put me in the way of making these little thread - cases , pin - cushions and card - racks , which you always find me so busy about , and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood . She had a large acquaintance , of course professionally , among those who can afford to buy , and she disposes of my merchandise . She always takes the right time for applying . Everybody 's heart is open , you know , when they have recently escaped from severe pain , or are recovering the blessing of health , and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak . She is a shrewd , intelligent , sensible woman . Hers is a line for seeing human nature ; and she has a fund of good sense and observation , which , as a companion , make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received ` the best education in the world , ' know nothing worth attending to . Call it gossip , if you will , but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour 's leisure to bestow on me , she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable : something that makes one know one 's species better . One likes to hear what is going on , to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly . To me , who live so much alone , her conversation , I assure you , is a treat . """
Mrs. Smith	""" Yes , """
Mrs. Smith	""" sometimes it may , though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe . Here and there , human nature may be great in times of trial ; but generally speaking , it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber : it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude , that one hears of . There is so little real friendship in the world ! and unfortunately """
Mrs. Smith	""" there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late . """
Mrs. Smith	""" I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me . She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings ; a mere pretty , silly , expensive , fashionable woman , I believe ; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery . I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis , however . She has plenty of money , and I intend she shall buy all the high - priced things I have in hand now . """
Mrs. Smith	""" By all means , """
Mrs. Smith	""" only tell me all about it , when you do come . Who is your party ? """
Mrs. Smith	""" Well , I heartily wish your concert may answer ; and do not fail me to - morrow if you can come ; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you . """
Mrs. Smith	""" Yes , I do . Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world , the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together . """
Mrs. Smith	""" And such being the case , """
Mrs. Smith	""" I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning . It is really very good of you to come and sit with me , when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time . """
Mrs. Smith	""" Pray , """
Mrs. Smith	""" is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ? Does he know that I am in Bath ? """
Mrs. Smith	""" I have been a good deal acquainted with him , """
Mrs. Smith	""" but it seems worn out now . It is a great while since we met . """
Mrs. Smith	""" To confess the truth , """
Mrs. Smith	""" that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have . I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot . I want your interest with him . He can be of essential service to me ; and if you would have the goodness , my dear Miss Elliot , to make it an object to yourself , of course it is done . """
Mrs. Smith	""" I have been a little premature , I perceive ; I beg your pardon . I ought to have waited for official information , But now , my dear Miss Elliot , as an old friend , do give me a hint as to when I may speak . Next week ? To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled , and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot 's good fortune . """
Mrs. Smith	""" Now , how I do wish I understood you ! How I do wish I knew what you were at ! I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel , when the right moment occurs . Till it does come , you know , we women never mean to have anybody . It is a thing of course among us , that every man is refused , till he offers . But why should you be cruel ? Let me plead for my -- present friend I can not call him , but for my former friend . Where can you look for a more suitable match ? Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike , agreeable man ? Let me recommend Mr Elliot . I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis ; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis ? """
Mrs. Smith	""" My dear Mrs Smith , Mr Elliot 's wife has not been dead much above half a year . He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one . """
Mrs. Smith	""" Oh ! if these are your only objections , """
Mrs. Smith	""" Mr Elliot is safe , and I shall give myself no more trouble about him . Do not forget me when you are married , that 's all . Let him know me to be a friend of yours , and then he will think little of the trouble required , which it is very natural for him now , with so many affairs and engagements of his own , to avoid and get rid of as he can ; very natural , perhaps . Ninety - nine out of a hundred would do the same . Of course , he can not be aware of the importance to me . Well , my dear Miss Elliot , I hope and trust you will be very happy . Mr Elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman . Your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been . You are safe in all worldly matters , and safe in his character . He will not be led astray ; he will not be misled by others to his ruin . """
Mrs. Smith	""" Do tell me how it first came into your head . """
Mrs. Smith	""" It first came into my head , """
Mrs. Smith	""" upon finding how much you were together , and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you ; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way . But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago . """
Mrs. Smith	""" And has it indeed been spoken of ? """
Mrs. Smith	""" Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday ? """
Mrs. Smith	""" No . Was not it Mrs Speed , as usual , or the maid ? I observed no one in particular . """
Mrs. Smith	""" It was my friend Mrs Rooke ; Nurse Rooke ; who , by - the - bye , had a great curiosity to see you , and was delighted to be in the way to let you in . She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday ; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot . She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself , which did not seem bad authority . She sat an hour with me on Monday evening , and gave me the whole history . """
Mrs. Smith	""" No , I thank you : no , certainly not . In the warmth of the moment , and under a mistaken impression , I might , perhaps , have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances ; but not now . No , I thank you , I have nothing to trouble you with . """
Mrs. Smith	""" I did . """
Mrs. Smith	""" Yes ; he was not married when I knew him first . """
Mrs. Smith	""" Intimately . """
Mrs. Smith	""" I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years , """
Mrs. Smith	""" I beg your pardon , my dear Miss Elliot , """
Mrs. Smith	""" I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you , but I have been uncertain what I ought to do . I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you . There were many things to be taken into the account . One hates to be officious , to be giving bad impressions , making mischief . Even the smooth surface of family - union seems worth preserving , though there may be nothing durable beneath . However , I have determined ; I think I am right ; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot 's real character . Though I fully believe that , at present , you have not the smallest intention of accepting him , there is no saying what may happen . You might , some time or other , be differently affected towards him . Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced . Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience ; a designing , wary , cold - blooded being , who thinks only of himself ; whom for his own interest or ease , would be guilty of any cruelty , or any treachery , that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character . He has no feeling for others . Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin , he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction . He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion . Oh ! he is black at heart , hollow and black ! """
Mrs. Smith	""" I know it all , I know it all , """
Mrs. Smith	""" He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him , but I heard him speak of them for ever . I know he was invited and encouraged , and I know he did not choose to go . I can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , I knew all about it at the time . I was privy to all the fors and againsts ; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans ; and though I did not know his wife previously , her inferior situation in society , indeed , rendered that impossible , yet I knew her all her life afterwards , or at least till within the last two years of her life , and can answer any question you may wish to put . """
Mrs. Smith	""" Mr Elliot , """
Mrs. Smith	""" at that period of his life , had one object in view : to make his fortune , and by a rather quicker process than the law . He was determined to make it by marriage . He was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and I know it was his belief ( whether justly or not , of course I can not decide ) , that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence . That was his motive for drawing back , I can assure you . He told me the whole story . He had no concealments with me . It was curious , that having just left you behind me in Bath , my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin ; and that , through him , I should be continually hearing of your father and sister . He described one Miss Elliot , and I thought very affectionately of the other . """
Mrs. Smith	""" To be sure I did ; very often . I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot , and vouch for your being a very different creature from-- """
Mrs. Smith	""" Oh ! those things are too common . When one lives in the world , a man or woman 's marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought . I was very young , and associated only with the young , and we were a thoughtless , gay set , without any strict rules of conduct . We lived for enjoyment . I think differently now ; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions ; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing . ` To do the best for himself , ' passed as a duty . """
Mrs. Smith	""" But was not she a very low woman ? """
Mrs. Smith	""" Yes ; which I objected to , but he would not regard . Money , money , was all that he wanted . Her father was a grazier , her grandfather had been a butcher , but that was all nothing . She was a fine woman , had had a decent education , was brought forward by some cousins , thrown by chance into Mr Elliot 's company , and fell in love with him ; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side , with respect to her birth . All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune , before he committed himself . Depend upon it , whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now , as a young man he had not the smallest value for it . His chance for the Kellynch estate was something , but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt . I have often heard him declare , that if baronetcies were saleable , anybody should have his for fifty pounds , arms and motto , name and livery included ; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject . It would not be fair ; and yet you ought to have proof , for what is all this but assertion , and you shall have proof . """
Mrs. Smith	""" But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary ; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . """
Mrs. Smith	""" This is full of papers belonging to him , to my husband ; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him . The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine . But he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when I came to examine his papers , I found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed . Here it is ; I would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot , I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy . I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it . """
Mrs. Smith	""" Charles Smith , Esq . Tunbridge Wells , """
Mrs. Smith	""" Dear Smith,--I have received yours . Your kindness almost overpowers me . I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common , but I have lived three - and - twenty years in the world , and have seen none like it . At present , believe me , I have no need of your services , being in cash again . Give me joy : I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss. They are gone back to Kellynch , and almost made me swear to visit them this summer ; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor , to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer . The baronet , nevertheless , is not unlikely to marry again ; he is quite fool enough . If he does , however , they will leave me in peace , which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion . He is worse than last year ."
Mrs. Smith	""" I wish I had any name but Elliot . I am sick of it . The name of Walter I can drop , thank God ! and I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again , meaning , for the rest of my life , to be only yours truly,--Wm . Elliot . """
Mrs. Smith	""" The language , I know , is highly disrespectful . Though I have forgot the exact terms , I have a perfect impression of the general meaning . But it shows you the man . Mark his professions to my poor husband . Can any thing be stronger ? """
Mrs. Smith	""" I can explain this too , """
Mrs. Smith	""" Well , """
Mrs. Smith	""" grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted . He saw you then at Lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place , as Miss Anne Elliot , and from that moment , I have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there . But there was another , and an earlier , which I will now explain . If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable , stop me . My account states , that your sister 's friend , the lady now staying with you , whom I have heard you mention , came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September ( in short when they first came themselves ) , and has been staying there ever since ; that she is a clever , insinuating , handsome woman , poor and plausible , and altogether such in situation and manner , as to give a general idea , among Sir Walter 's acquaintance , of her meaning to be Lady Elliot , and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently , blind to the danger . """
Mrs. Smith	""" Lessening , I understand , """
Mrs. Smith	""" He thinks Mrs Clay afraid of him , aware that he sees through her , and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence . But since he must be absent some time or other , I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence . Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea , as nurse tells me , that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry , that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay . A scheme , worthy of Mrs Wallis 's understanding , by all accounts ; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it . ` Why , to be sure , ma'am , ' said she , ` it would not prevent his marrying anybody else . ' And , indeed , to own the truth , I do not think nurse , in her heart , is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter 's making a second match . She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony , you know ; and ( since self will intrude ) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot , through Mrs Wallis 's recommendation ? """
Mrs. Smith	""" She had seemed to recommend and praise him ! """
Mrs. Smith	""" My dear , """
Mrs. Smith	""" there was nothing else to be done . I considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and I could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband . My heart bled for you , as I talked of happiness ; and yet he is sensible , he is agreeable , and with such a woman as you , it was not absolutely hopeless . He was very unkind to his first wife . They were wretched together . But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect , and he had never loved her . I was willing to hope that you must fare better . """
Lady Russell	""" If we can persuade your father to all this , """
Lady Russell	""" much may be done . If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth , that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which can not be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle . What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ? There will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct . I have great hope of prevailing . We must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man . """
Lady Russell	""" What ! every comfort of life knocked off ! Journeys , London , servants , horses , table-- contractions and restrictions every where ! To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman ! No , he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once , than remain in it on such disgraceful terms . """
Lady Russell	""" I must see Captain Benwick before I decide , """
Lady Russell	""" Any acquaintance of Anne 's will always be welcome to me , """
Lady Russell	""" Upon my word , """
Lady Russell	""" I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture , steady and matter of fact as I may call myself . I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions . I wish he may be induced to call here . And when he does , Mary , you may depend upon hearing my opinion ; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand . """
Lady Russell	""" You will not like him , I will answer for it . """
Lady Russell	""" He is a man , """
Lady Russell	""" whom I have no wish to see . His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family , has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me . """
Lady Russell	""" I hope I shall remember , in future , """
Lady Russell	""" not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays . """
Lady Russell	""" a man whom she had no wish to see . """
Lady Russell	""" Elizabeth . """
Lady Russell	"reply:--""Elizabeth ! very well ; time will explain . """
Lady Russell	""" it was an acquaintance worth having ; """
Lady Russell	""" I am no match - maker , as you well know , """
Lady Russell	""" being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations . I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together . A most suitable connection everybody must consider it , but I think it might be a very happy one . """
Lady Russell	""" I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother 's place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me . You are your mother 's self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued ! My dearest Anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! """
Lady Russell	""" Lady Elliot """
Louisa Musgrove	""" And I will tell you our reason , """
Louisa Musgrove	""" and all about it . I am come on to give you notice , that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening , especially mamma ; she is thinking so much of poor Richard ! And we agreed it would be best to have the harp , for it seems to amuse her more than the piano - forte . I will tell you why she is out of spirits . When the Crofts called this morning , ( they called here afterwards , did not they ? ) , they happened to say , that her brother , Captain Wentworth , is just returned to England , or paid off , or something , and is coming to see them almost directly ; and most unluckily it came into mamma 's head , when they were gone , that Wentworth , or something very like it , was the name of poor Richard 's captain at one time ; I do not know when or where , but a great while before he died , poor fellow ! And upon looking over his letters and things , she found it was so , and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man , and her head is quite full of it , and of poor Richard ! So we must be as merry as we can , that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things . """
Louisa Musgrove	""" But , Captain Wentworth , """
Louisa Musgrove	""" how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp , to see what an old thing they had given you . """
Louisa Musgrove	""" Well , I am very glad indeed : but I always thought you would have it ; I always thought you sure . It did not appear to me that -- in short , you know , Dr Shirley must have a curate , and you had secured his promise . Is he coming , Louisa ? """
Louisa Musgrove	""" Ah ! You make the most of it , I know , """
Louisa Musgrove	""" but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place . If I loved a man , as she loves the Admiral , I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else . """
Louisa Musgrove	""" No , no ! """
Louisa Musgrove	""" And so , I made her go . I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . What ! would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do , and that I knew to be right , by the airs and interference of such a person , or of any person I may say ? No , I have no idea of being so easily persuaded . When I have made up my mind , I have made it ; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to - day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance ! """
Louisa Musgrove	""" She would have turned back then , but for you ? """
Louisa Musgrove	""" She would indeed . I am almost ashamed to say it . """
Louisa Musgrove	""" Mary is good - natured enough in many respects , """
Louisa Musgrove	""" but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride -- the Elliot pride . She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride . We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead . I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne ? """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" Then I am sure Anne had better stay , for nobody will want her in Bath . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" Mrs Clay , """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" never forgets who she is ; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , I can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people . And as to my father , I really should not have thought that he , who has kept himself single so long for our sakes , need be suspected now . If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman , I grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , I am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy . But poor Mrs Clay who , with all her merits , can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty , I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety . One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes , though I know you must fifty times . That tooth of her 's and those freckles . Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him . I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few , but he abominates them . You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay 's freckles . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" I think very differently , """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" an agreeable manner may set off handsome features , but can never alter plain ones . However , at any rate , as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have , I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" That must not be any reason , indeed . I assure you I feel it none . She is nothing to me , compared with you ; """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" My dear madam , this must not be . As yet , you have seen nothing of Bath . You have been here only to be useful . You must not run away from us now . You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis , the beautiful Mrs Wallis . To your fine mind , I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" Miss Elliot , """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" No , sir , she is not one - and - thirty ; but I do not think I can put off my engagement , because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself . She goes into the warm bath to - morrow , and for the rest of the week , you know , we are engaged . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance ? """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" How is Mary ? """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath ? """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" They come on the Admiral 's account . He is thought to be gouty . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" Have they any acquaintance here ? """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" I do not know ; but I can hardly suppose that , at Admiral Croft 's time of life , and in his profession , he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" I had not the smallest intention of asking him , """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" but he gave so many hints ; so Mrs Clay says , at least . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" Indeed , I do say it . I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation . Poor man ! I was really in pain for him ; for your hard - hearted sister , Miss Anne , seems bent on cruelty . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" Oh ! """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman 's hints . However , when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning , I gave way immediately , for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together . They appear to so much advantage in company with each other . Each behaving so pleasantly . Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" Oh ! I lay no embargo on any body 's words . If you will have such ideas ! But , upon my word , I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" Well , my dear Penelope , you need not be so alarmed about him . I did invite him , you know . I sent him away with smiles . When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to - morrow , I had compassion on him . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" Very well , """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" I have nothing to send but my love . Oh ! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me , and pretend I have read it through . I really can not be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out . Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications . You need not tell her so , but I thought her dress hideous the other night . I used to think she had some taste in dress , but I was ashamed of her at the concert . Something so formal and arrange in her air ! and she sits so upright ! My best love , of course . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" Old fashioned notions ; country hospitality ; we do not profess to give dinners ; few people in Bath do ; Lady Alicia never does ; did not even ask her own sister 's family , though they were here a month : and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove ; put her quite out of her way . I am sure she would rather not come ; she can not feel easy with us . I will ask them all for an evening ; that will be much better ; that will be a novelty and a treat . They have not seen two such drawing rooms before . They will be delighted to come to - morrow evening . It shall be a regular party , small , but most elegant . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" To - morrow evening , to meet a few friends : no formal party . """
Elizabeth Elliot	""" Miss Elliot at home , """
Captain Benwick	""" dark blue seas """
Captain Benwick	""" Do n't talk of it , do n't talk of it , """
Captain Benwick	""" Oh God ! that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment ! Had I done as I ought ! But so eager and so resolute ! Dear , sweet Louisa ! """
Admiral Croft	""" I thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at Taunton . The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him . """
Admiral Croft	""" We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft 's here soon ; I dare say you know him by name . """
Admiral Croft	""" Phoo ! phoo ! """
Admiral Croft	""" what stuff these young fellows talk ! Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day . For an old built sloop , you would not see her equal . Lucky fellow to get her ! He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time . Lucky fellow to get anything so soon , with no more interest than his . """
Admiral Croft	""" If you had been a week later at Lisbon , last spring , Frederick , you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her daughters . """
Admiral Croft	""" Should I ? I am glad I was not a week later then . """
Admiral Croft	""" But , if I know myself , """
Admiral Croft	""" this is from no want of gallantry towards them . It is rather from feeling how impossible it is , with all one 's efforts , and all one 's sacrifices , to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have . There can be no want of gallantry , Admiral , in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high , and this is what I do . I hate to hear of women on board , or to see them on board ; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere , if I can help it . """
Admiral Croft	""" Ah ! my dear , """
Admiral Croft	""" when he had got a wife , he will sing a different tune . When he is married , if we have the good luck to live to another war , we shall see him do as you and I , and a great many others , have done . We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife . """
Admiral Croft	""" He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , Sophy , """
Admiral Croft	""" but there is no saying which . He has been running after them , too , long enough , one would think , to make up his mind . Ay , this comes of the peace . If it were war now , he would have settled it long ago . We sailors , Miss Elliot , can not afford to make long courtships in time of war . How many days was it , my dear , between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth ? """
Admiral Croft	""" Well , and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl , and what were we to wait for besides ? I do not like having such things so long in hand . I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass , and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch . Then there would always be company for them . And very nice young ladies they both are ; I hardly know one from the other . """
Admiral Croft	""" Ay , a very bad business indeed . A new sort of way this , for a young fellow to be making love , by breaking his mistress 's head , is not it , Miss Elliot ? This is breaking a head and giving a plaster , truly ! """
Admiral Croft	""" Another time , Sir , I thank you , not now . """
Admiral Croft	""" We have made very few changes either , """
Admiral Croft	""" Very few . We told you about the laundry - door , at Uppercross . That has been a very great improvement . The wonder was , how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did , so long ! You will tell Sir Walter what we have done , and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had . Indeed , I must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better . My wife should have the credit of them , however . I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking - glasses from my dressing - room , which was your father 's . A very good man , and very much the gentleman I am sure : but I should think , Miss Elliot , """
Admiral Croft	""" I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life . Such a number of looking - glasses ! oh Lord ! there was no getting away from one 's self . So I got Sophy to lend me a hand , and we soon shifted their quarters ; and now I am quite snug , with my little shaving glass in one corner , and another great thing that I never go near . """
Admiral Croft	""" The next time you write to your good father , Miss Elliot , pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft 's , and say that we are settled here quite to our liking , and have no fault at all to find with the place . The breakfast - room chimney smokes a little , I grant you , but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard , which may not happen three times a winter . And take it altogether , now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge , there is not one that we like better than this . Pray say so , with my compliments . He will be glad to hear it . """
Admiral Croft	""" Ha ! is it you ? Thank you , thank you . This is treating me like a friend . Here I am , you see , staring at a picture . I can never get by this shop without stopping . But what a thing here is , by way of a boat ! Do look at it . Did you ever see the like ? What queer fellows your fine painters must be , to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that ? And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease , and looking about them at the rocks and mountains , as if they were not to be upset the next moment , which they certainly must be . I wonder where that boat was built ! """
Admiral Croft	""" I would not venture over a horsepond in it . Well , """
Admiral Croft	""" now , where are you bound ? Can I go anywhere for you , or with you ? Can I be of any use ? """
Admiral Croft	""" None , I thank you , unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together . I am going home . """
Admiral Croft	""" That I will , with all my heart , and farther , too . Yes , yes we will have a snug walk together , and I have something to tell you as we go along . There , take my arm ; that 's right ; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there . Lord ! what a boat it is ! """
Admiral Croft	""" Did you say that you had something to tell me , sir ? """
Admiral Croft	""" Yes , I have , presently . But here comes a friend , Captain Brigden ; I shall only say , ` How d'ye do ? ' as we pass , however . I shall not stop . ` How d'ye do ? ' Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife . She , poor soul , is tied by the leg . She has a blister on one of her heels , as large as a three - shilling piece . If you look across the street , you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother . Shabby fellows , both of them ! I am glad they are not on this side of the way . Sophy can not bear them . They played me a pitiful trick once : got away with some of my best men . I will tell you the whole story another time . There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson . Look , he sees us ; he kisses his hand to you ; he takes you for my wife . Ah ! the peace has come too soon for that younker . Poor old Sir Archibald ! How do you like Bath , Miss Elliot ? It suits us very well . We are always meeting with some old friend or other ; the streets full of them every morning ; sure to have plenty of chat ; and then we get away from them all , and shut ourselves in our lodgings , and draw in our chairs , and are snug as if we were at Kellynch , ay , or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal . We do not like our lodgings here the worse , I can tell you , for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth . The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way . """
Admiral Croft	""" And the thing is certainly true . It is not a mere bit of gossip . We have it from Frederick himself . His sister had a letter from him yesterday , in which he tells us of it , and he had just had it in a letter from Harville , written upon the spot , from Uppercross . I fancy they are all at Uppercross . """
Admiral Croft	""" Poor Frederick ! """
Admiral Croft	""" Now he must begin all over again with somebody else . I think we must get him to Bath . Sophy must write , and beg him to come to Bath . Here are pretty girls enough , I am sure . It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again , for that other Miss Musgrove , I find , is bespoke by her cousin , the young parson . Do not you think , Miss Elliot , we had better try to get him to Bath ? """
Mrs. Croft	""" It was you , and not your sister , I find , that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with , when he was in this country . """
Mrs. Croft	""" Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married ? """
Mrs. Croft	""" And I do assure you , ma'am , """
Mrs. Croft	""" that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man - of - war ; I speak , you know , of the higher rates . When you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and I can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship . While we were together , you know , there was nothing to be feared . Thank God ! I have always been blessed with excellent health , and no climate disagrees with me . A little disordered always the first twenty - four hours of going to sea , but never knew what sickness was afterwards . The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind , the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell , or had any ideas of danger , was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal , when the Admiral ( Captain Croft then ) was in the North Seas . I lived in perpetual fright at that time , and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself , or when I should hear from him next ; but as long as we could be together , nothing ever ailed me , and I never met with the smallest inconvenience . """
Mrs. Croft	""" Miss Elliot , I am sure you are tired , """
Mrs. Croft	""" Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home . Here is excellent room for three , I assure you . If we were all like you , I believe we might sit four . You must , indeed , you must . """
Mrs. Croft	""" We had better not talk about it , my dear , """
Mrs. Croft	""" for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding , she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together . I had known you by character , however , long before . """
Mrs. Croft	""" Very good humoured , unaffected girls , indeed , """
Mrs. Croft	""" and a very respectable family . One could not be connected with better people . My dear Admiral , that post ! we shall certainly take that post . """
Mrs. Croft	""" how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over ; what my brother Hayter had said one day , and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next , and what had occurred to my sister Hayter , and what the young people had wished , and what I said at first I never could consent to , but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well , """
Mrs. Croft	""" That is precisely what I was going to observe , """
Mrs. Croft	""" I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once , and have to struggle with a few difficulties together , than be involved in a long engagement . I always think that no mutual-- """
Mrs. Croft	""" Yes , dear ma'am , """
Mrs. Croft	""" or an uncertain engagement , an engagement which may be long . To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying , I hold to be very unsafe and unwise , and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can . """
Mrs. Croft	""" Here , Frederick , you and I part company , I believe , """
Mrs. Croft	""" I am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend . To - night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party , """
Mrs. Croft	""" We had your sister 's card yesterday , and I understood Frederick had a card too , though I did not see it ; and you are disengaged , Frederick , are you not , as well as ourselves ? """
Mrs. Croft	""" Good morning , God bless you ! """
Mrs. Croft	""" I can listen no longer in silence . I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach . You pierce my soul . I am half agony , half hope . Tell me not that I am too late , that such precious feelings are gone for ever . I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it , eight years and a half ago . Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman , that his love has an earlier death . I have loved none but you . Unjust I may have been , weak and resentful I have been , but never inconstant . You alone have brought me to Bath . For you alone , I think and plan . Have you not seen this ? Can you fail to have understood my wishes ? I had not waited even these ten days , could I have read your feelings , as I think you must have penetrated mine . I can hardly write . I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me . You sink your voice , but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others . Too good , too excellent creature ! You do us justice , indeed . You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men . Believe it to be most fervent , most undeviating , in F. W."
Mrs. Croft	""" I must go , uncertain of my fate ; but I shall return hither , or follow your party , as soon as possible . A word , a look , will be enough to decide whether I enter your father 's house this evening or never . """
Henrietta Musgrove	""" It would not be a great match for her ; but if Henrietta liked him,""--"
Henrietta Musgrove	""" Oh ! yes,--I am quite convinced that , with very few exceptions , the sea - air always does good . There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to Dr Shirley , after his illness , last spring twelve - month . He declares himself , that coming to Lyme for a month , did him more good than all the medicine he took ; and , that being by the sea , always makes him feel young again . Now , I can not help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea . I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely , and fix at Lyme . Do not you , Anne ? Do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and Mrs Shirley ? She has cousins here , you know , and many acquaintance , which would make it cheerful for her , and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand , in case of his having another seizure . Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley , who have been doing good all their lives , wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross , where , excepting our family , they seem shut out from all the world . I wish his friends would propose it to him . I really think they ought . And , as to procuring a dispensation , there could be no difficulty at his time of life , and with his character . My only doubt is , whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish . He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions ; over - scrupulous I must say . Do not you think , Anne , it is being over - scrupulous ? Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience , when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties , which may be just as well performed by another person ? And at Lyme too , only seventeen miles off , he would be near enough to hear , if people thought there was anything to complain of . """
Henrietta Musgrove	""" I wish , """
Henrietta Musgrove	""" I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross , and were intimate with Dr Shirley . I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody ! I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything ! I am afraid of her , as I have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but I respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross . """
Mrs. Clay	""" They would look around them , no doubt , and bless their good fortune , """
Mrs. Clay	""" Nay , Sir Walter , """
Mrs. Clay	""" this is being severe indeed . Have a little mercy on the poor men . We are not all born to be handsome . The sea is no beautifier , certainly ; sailors do grow old betimes ; I have observed it ; they soon lose the look of youth . But then , is not it the same with many other professions , perhaps most other ? Soldiers , in active service , are not at all better off : and even in the quieter professions , there is a toil and a labour of the mind , if not of the body , which seldom leaves a man 's looks to the natural effect of time . The lawyer plods , quite care - worn ; the physician is up at all hours , and travelling in all weather ; and even the clergyman-- """
Mrs. Clay	""" I have no conception whom you can mean , Shepherd ; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent . """
Mrs. Clay	""" Bless me ! how very odd ! I shall forget my own name soon , I suppose . A name that I am so very well acquainted with ; knew the gentleman so well by sight ; seen him a hundred times ; came to consult me once , I remember , about a trespass of one of his neighbours ; farmer 's man breaking into his orchard ; wall torn down ; apples stolen ; caught in the fact ; and afterwards , contrary to my judgement , submitted to an amicable compromise . Very odd indeed ! """
Mrs. Clay	""" Wentworth was the very name ! Mr Wentworth was the very man . He had the curacy of Monkford , you know , Sir Walter , some time back , for two or three years . Came there about the year ---5 , I take it . You remember him , I am sure . """
Mrs. Clay	""" now Miss Anne was come , she could not suppose herself at all wanted ; """
Mrs. Clay	""" Can this be Mr Elliot ? """
Mrs. Clay	""" Quite delightful ! """
Mrs. Clay	""" Exactly like father and son ! Dear Miss Elliot , may I not say father and son ? """
Mrs. Clay	""" My dear Miss Elliot ! """
Captain Harville	""" Miss Elliot , """
Captain Harville	""" you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much . I wish he could have such company oftener . It is bad for him , I know , to be shut up as he is ; but what can we do ? We can not part . """
Captain Harville	""" Ay , true enough , """
Captain Harville	""" And not known to him , perhaps , so soon . """
Captain Harville	""" Come to me , I have something to say ; """
Captain Harville	""" Look here , """
Captain Harville	""" do you know who that is ? """
Captain Harville	""" Yes , and you may guess who it is for . But , """
Captain Harville	""" it was not done for her . Miss Elliot , do you remember our walking together at Lyme , and grieving for him ? I little thought then-- but no matter . This was drawn at the Cape . He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape , and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister , sat to him , and was bringing it home for her ; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another ! It was a commission to me ! But who else was there to employ ? I hope I can allow for him . I am not sorry , indeed , to make it over to another . He undertakes it ; """
Captain Harville	""" Do you claim that for your sex ? """
Captain Harville	""" We shall never agree upon this question , """
Captain Harville	""" Have you finished your letter ? """
Captain Harville	""" Not quite , a few lines more . I shall have done in five minutes . """
Captain Harville	""" Perhaps I shall . Yes , yes , if you please , no reference to examples in books . Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story . Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree ; the pen has been in their hands . I will not allow books to prove anything . """
Captain Harville	""" We never shall . We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point . It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof . We each begin , probably , with a little bias towards our own sex ; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle ; many of which circumstances ( perhaps those very cases which strike us the most ) may be precisely such as can not be brought forward without betraying a confidence , or in some respect saying what should not be said . """
Captain Harville	""" Ah ! """
Captain Harville	""" if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children , and watches the boat that he has sent them off in , as long as it is in sight , and then turns away and says , ` God knows whether we ever meet again ! ' And then , if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again ; when , coming back after a twelvemonth 's absence , perhaps , and obliged to put into another port , he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there , pretending to deceive himself , and saying , ` They can not be here till such a day , ' but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner , and seeing them arrive at last , as if Heaven had given them wings , by many hours sooner still ! If I could explain to you all this , and all that a man can bear and do , and glories to do , for the sake of these treasures of his existence ! I speak , you know , only of such men as have hearts ! """
Captain Harville	""" You are a good soul , """
Captain Harville	""" There is no quarrelling with you . And when I think of Benwick , my tongue is tied . """
Mr. Shepherd	""" Quit Kellynch Hall . """
Mr. Shepherd	""" Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate , he had no scruple , """
Mr. Shepherd	""" in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side . It did not appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support . In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself ; and would be looked up to , as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household . """
Mr. Shepherd	""" advertise , """
Mr. Shepherd	""" I must take leave to observe , Sir Walter , """
Mr. Shepherd	""" that the present juncture is much in our favour . This peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore . They will be all wanting a home . Could not be a better time , Sir Walter , for having a choice of tenants , very responsible tenants . Many a noble fortune has been made during the war . If a rich admiral were to come in our way , Sir Walter-- """
Mr. Shepherd	""" I presume to observe , Sir Walter , that , in the way of business , gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with . I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business ; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions , and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with . Therefore , Sir Walter , what I would take leave to suggest is , that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention ; which must be contemplated as a possible thing , because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other ; consequence has its tax ; I , John Shepherd , might conceal any family - matters that I chose , for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me ; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude ; and therefore , thus much I venture upon , that it will not greatly surprise me if , with all our caution , some rumour of the truth should get abroad ; in the supposition of which , as I was going to observe , since applications will unquestionably follow , I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to ; and beg leave to add , that two hours will bring me over at any time , to save you the trouble of replying . """
Mr. Shepherd	""" In all these cases , there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant . Your interest , Sir Walter , is in pretty safe hands . Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights . I venture to hint , that Sir Walter Elliot can not be half so jealous for his own , as John Shepherd will be for him . """
Mr. Shepherd	""" Very true , very true . What Miss Anne says , is very true , """
Mr. Shepherd	""" Oh ! certainly , """
Mr. Shepherd	""" And a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be , """
Mr. Shepherd	""" asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the Admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , Sir Walter , I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford . Bless me ! what was his name ? At this moment I can not recollect his name , though I have heard it so lately . Penelope , my dear , can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford : Mrs Croft 's brother ? """
Mr. Shepherd	""" Wentworth ? Oh ! ay,--Mr Wentworth , the curate of Monkford . You misled me by the term gentleman . I thought you were speaking of some man of property : Mr Wentworth was nobody , I remember ; quite unconnected ; nothing to do with the Strafford family . One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common . """
Mrs. Harville	""" She really left nothing for Mary to do . He and Mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night . Mary had been hysterical again this morning . When he came away , she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good . He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do . """
