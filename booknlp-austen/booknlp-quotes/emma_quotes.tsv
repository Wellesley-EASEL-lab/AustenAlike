Emma Woodhouse	""" Especially when _ one _ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" That is what you have in your head , I know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" and a very considerable one -- that I made the match myself . I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well done , Mrs. Martin ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You know what you are about . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ? He does not read ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! not handsome -- not at all handsome . I thought him very plain at first , but I do not think him so plain now . One does not , you know , after a time . But did you never see him ? He is in Highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston . He has passed you very often . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name . A young farmer , whether on horseback or on foot , is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity . The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do . A degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other . But a farmer can need none of my help , and is , therefore , in one sense , as much above my notice as in every other he is below it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" To be sure . Oh yes ! It is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed -- I mean by sight . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man . I know , indeed , that he is so , and , as such , wish him well . What do you imagine his age to be ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" He was four - and - twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day 's difference -- which is very odd . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Only four - and - twenty . That is too young to settle . His mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry . They seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it . Six years hence , if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own , with a little money , it might be very desirable . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Six years hence ! Dear Miss Woodhouse , he would be thirty years old ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , and that is as early as most men can afford to marry , who are not born to an independence . Mr. Martin , I imagine , has his fortune entirely to make -- cannot be at all beforehand with the world . Whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , I dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" To be sure , so it is . But they live very comfortably . They have no indoors man , else they do not want for any thing ; and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry;--I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice . The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates . There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman 's daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are . But while I visit at Hartfield , and you are so kind to me , Miss Woodhouse , I am not afraid of what any body can do . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse . I want to see you permanently well connected , and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries , I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters , to be acquainted with the wife , who will probably be some mere farmer 's daughter , without education . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" To be sure . Yes . Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up . However , I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's -- and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife . I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins , especially Elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me . But if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly I had better not visit her , if I can help it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be ! I would give any money for it . I almost long to attempt her likeness myself . You do not know it I dare say , but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general . But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust . But really , I could almost venture , if Harriet would sit to me . It would be such a delight to have her picture ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , if you give me such kind encouragement , Mr. Elton , I believe I shall try what I can do . Harriet 's features are very delicate , which makes a likeness difficult ; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But I am afraid , Mr. Elton , Harriet will not like to sit . She thinks so little of her own beauty . Did not you observe her manner of answering me ? How completely it meant , ` why should my picture be drawn ? ' """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No great variety of faces for you , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I had only my own family to study from . There is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that I could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore . Mrs. Weston again , and again , and again , you see . Dear Mrs. Weston ! always my kindest friend on every occasion . She would sit whenever I asked her . There is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike . I should have made a good likeness of her , if she would have sat longer , but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet . Then , here come all my attempts at three of those four children;--there they are , Henry and John and Bella , from one end of the sheet to the other , and any one of them might do for any one of the rest . She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama 's children ever were . Here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby . I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see . He had nestled down his head most conveniently . That 's very like . I am rather proud of little George . The corner of the sofa is very good . Then here is my last,""--unclosing"
Emma Woodhouse	""" This man is almost too gallant to be in love , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I should say so , but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love . He is an excellent young man , and will suit Harriet exactly ; it will be an ` Exactly so , ' as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal . I come in for a pretty good share as a second . But it is his gratitude on Harriet 's account . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Who could have thought it ? She was so surprized she did not know what to do . Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so . And he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.-- """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon my word , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking . He will connect himself well if he can . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , well , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Is it a good letter ? or is it too short ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes , indeed , a very good letter , """
Emma Woodhouse	"slowly--""so good a letter , Harriet , that every thing considered , I think one of his sisters must have helped him . I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman . No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words . It is so with some men . Yes , I understand the sort of mind . Vigorous , decided , with sentiments to a certain point , not coarse . A better written letter , Harriet ( returning it , ) than I had expected . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , """
Emma Woodhouse	"Harriet;--""well -- and -- and what shall I do ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" What shall you do ! In what respect ? Do you mean with regard to this letter ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But what are you in doubt of ? You must answer it of course -- and speedily . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes . But what shall I say ? Dear Miss Woodhouse , do advise me . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh no , no ! the letter had much better be all your own . You will express yourself very properly , I am sure . There is no danger of your not being intelligible , which is the first thing . Your meaning must be unequivocal ; no doubts or demurs : and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires , will present themselves unbidden to _ your _ mind , I am persuaded . You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ought to refuse him ! My dear Harriet , what do you mean ? Are you in any doubt as to that ? I thought -- but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have been under a mistake . I certainly have been misunderstanding you , if you feel in doubt as to the _ purport _ of your answer . I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , I do not ; that is , I do not mean -- What shall I do ? What would you advise me to do ? Pray , dear Miss Woodhouse , tell me what I ought to do . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I shall not give you any advice , Harriet . I will have nothing to do with it . This is a point which you must settle with your feelings . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I lay it down as a general rule , Harriet , that if a woman _ doubts _ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him . If she can hesitate as to ` Yes , ' she ought to say ` No ' directly . It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings , with half a heart . I thought it my duty as a friend , and older than yourself , to say thus much to you . But do not imagine that I want to influence you . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! no , I am sure you are a great deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me what I had best do -- No , no , I do not mean that -- As you say , one 's mind ought to be quite made up -- One should not be hesitating -- It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say ` No , ' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say ` No ? ' """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Not for the world , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" would I advise you either way . You must be the best judge of your own happiness . If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ? You blush , Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition ? Harriet , Harriet , do not deceive yourself ; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion . At this moment whom are you thinking of ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend . We will not be parted . A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! yes , very . Nobody cares for a letter ; the thing is , to be always happy with pleasant companions . I am quite determined to refuse him . But how shall I do ? What shall I say ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" At this moment , perhaps , Mr. Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original , and after being asked for it five or six times , allowing them to hear your name , your own dear name . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton . No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow . It is his companion all this evening , his solace , his delight . It opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession . How cheerful , how animated , how suspicious , how busy their imaginations all are ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" He is very obliging , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Pray , Mr. Knightley , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" how do you know that Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Come , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me . He did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! to be sure , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage . A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And if I did , ( which , however , I am far from allowing ) I should not feel that I had done wrong . Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man , but I can not admit him to be Harriet 's equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her . By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples . It is a pity that they were ever got over . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation . Emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you . What are Harriet Smith 's claims , either of birth , nature or education , to any connexion higher than Robert Martin ? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations . She is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school . She is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information . She has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself . At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her . She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all . My only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him . I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse . But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well . The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have I now ) that there would be a general cry - out upon her extreme good luck . Even _ your _ satisfaction I made sure of . It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend 's leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well . I remember saying to myself , ` Even Emma , with all her partiality for Harriet , will think this a good match . ' """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I can not help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing . What ! think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more , ) a good match for my intimate friend ! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own ! I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings . I assure you mine are very different . I must think your statement by no means fair . You are not just to Harriet 's claims . They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves is much above his.--It would be a degradation . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense . She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman 's daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen 's daughters , no one , I apprehend , will deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet . Harriet 's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice . Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too . Better be without sense , than misapply it as you do . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am very much obliged to you , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton 's marrying Harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself . I have done with match - making indeed . I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls . I shall leave off while I am well . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Take it , """
Emma Woodhouse	"Harriet--""it is for you . Take your own . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" that I can not have a doubt as to Mr. Elton 's intentions . You are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it . I thought it must be so . I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you . Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened . I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural . Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other ! I am very happy . I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart . This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating . This is a connexion which offers nothing but good . It will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to Hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever . This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Dear Miss Woodhouse , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Very well , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better I shall be pleased . But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him . It will be giving him so much pleasure ! He loves any thing of the sort , and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment . He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here . I am sure she will be pleased with the children . We are very proud of the children , are not we , papa ? I wonder which she will think the handsomest , Henry or John ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Aye , I wonder which she will . Poor little dears , how glad they will be to come . They are very fond of being at Hartfield , Harriet . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I dare say they are , sir . I am sure I do not know who is not . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Henry is a fine boy , but John is very like his mama . Henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father . John , the second , is named after his father . Some people are surprized , I believe , that the eldest was not , but Isabella would have him called Henry , which I thought very pretty of her . And he is a very clever boy , indeed . They are all remarkably clever ; and they have so many pretty ways . They will come and stand by my chair , and say , ` Grandpapa , can you give me a bit of string ? ' and once Henry asked me for a knife , but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas . I think their father is too rough with them very often . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" He appears rough to you , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough . He wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father . The children are all fond of him . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And then their uncle comes in , and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much . It is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , I can not understand it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" That is the case with us all , papa . One half of the world can not understand the pleasures of the other . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it . We admired it so much , that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith 's collection . Your friend will not take it amiss I hope . Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You must make my apologies to your friend ; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two . He may be sure of every woman 's approbation while he writes with such gallantry . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do not often walk this way _ now _ , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" but _ then _ there will be an inducement , and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges , gates , pools and pollards of this part of Highbury . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" My being charming , Harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; I must find other people charming -- one other person at least . And I am not only , not going to be married , at present , but have very little intention of ever marrying at all . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet , to be tempted ; Mr. Elton , you know , ( recollecting herself , ) is out of the question : and I do _ not _ wish to see any such person . I would rather not be tempted . I can not really change for the better . If I were to marry , I must expect to repent it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry . Were I to fall in love , indeed , it would be a different thing ! but I never have been in love ; it is not my way , or my nature ; and I do not think I ever shall . And , without love , I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine . Fortune I do not want ; employment I do not want ; consequence I do not want : I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband 's house as I am of Hartfield ; and never , never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man 's eyes as I am in my father 's . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" That is as formidable an image as you could present , Harriet ; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates ! so silly -- so satisfied-- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious-- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , I would marry to - morrow . But between _ us _ , I am convinced there never can be any likeness , except in being unmarried . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Never mind , Harriet , I shall not be a poor old maid ; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public ! A single woman , with a very narrow income , must be a ridiculous , disagreeable old maid ! the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else . And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first ; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind , and sour the temper . Those who can barely live , and who live perforce in a very small , and generally very inferior , society , may well be illiberal and cross . This does not apply , however , to Miss Bates ; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me ; but , in general , she is very much to the taste of every body , though single and though poor . Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind : I really believe , if she had only a shilling in the world , she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it ; and nobody is afraid of her : that is a great charm . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" If I know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty . Woman 's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now ; or with no important variation . If I draw less , I shall read more ; if I give up music , I shall take to carpet - work . And as for objects of interest , objects for the affections , which is in truth the great point of inferiority , the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in _ not _ marrying , I shall be very well off , with all the children of a sister I love so much , to care about . There will be enough of them , in all probability , to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need . There will be enough for every hope and every fear ; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent , it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder . My nephews and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! yes ; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury . By the bye , _ that _ is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece . Heaven forbid ! at least , that I should ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together , as she does about Jane Fairfax . One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax . Every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month . I wish Jane Fairfax very well ; but she tires me to death . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" These are the sights , Harriet , to do one good . How trifling they make every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day ; and yet , who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And really , I do not think the impression will soon be over , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do not think it will , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" To fall in with each other on such an errand as this , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring a great increase of love on each side . I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration . It must , if I were not here . I wish I were anywhere else . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" This would soon have led to something better , of course , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" any thing interests between those who love ; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart . If I could but have kept longer away ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Part of my lace is gone , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" and I do not know how I am to contrive . I really am a most troublesome companion to you both , but I hope I am not often so ill - equipped . Mr. Elton , I must beg leave to stop at your house , and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string , or any thing just to keep my boot on . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Cautious , very cautious , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" he advances inch by inch , and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" He has not been here yet , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage , but it ended in nothing ; and I have not heard him mentioned lately . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dear papa , he is three - and - twenty . You forget how time passes . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Come , come , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I must beg you not to talk of the sea . It makes me envious and miserable;-- I who have never seen it ! South End is prohibited , if you please . My dear Isabella , I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet ; and he never forgets you . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Why , pretty well ; but not quite well . Poor Perry is bilious , and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country . I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere . But then there is not so clever a man any where . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I hope he will be here to - morrow , for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence . And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella 's throat . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is not very likely , my dear , that bathing should have been of use to her -- and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation , I would have spoken to--"
Emma Woodhouse	""" You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have not heard one inquiry after them . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! the good Bateses -- I am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters . I hope they are quite well . Good old Mrs. Bates -- I will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.-- And that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!-- How are they , sir ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole . But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" How sorry I am ! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn . Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy -- except when it has been quite an influenza . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" That has been a good deal the case , my dear ; but not to the degree you mention . Perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November . Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _ very _ sickly except--"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ah ! my poor dear child , the truth is , that in London it is always a sickly season . Nobody is healthy in London , nobody can be . It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there ! so far off!-- and the air so bad ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , indeed--_we _ are not at all in a bad air . Our part of London is very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London in general , my dear sir . The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest . We are so very airy ! I should be unwilling , I own , to live in any other part of the town;-- there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in : but _ we _ are so remarkably airy!--Mr . Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ah ! my dear , it is not like Hartfield . You make the best of it-- but after you have been a week at Hartfield , you are all of you different creatures ; you do not look like the same . Now I can not say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but I assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere , I am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming . I hope you will think better of their looks to - morrow ; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case . I trust , at least , that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Middling , my dear ; I can not compliment you . I think Mr. John Knightley very far from looking well . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" about your friend Mr. Graham 's intending to have a bailiff from Scotland , to look after his new estate . What will it answer ? Will not the old prejudice be too strong ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston . But , upon my word , Mr. Elton , in your case , I should certainly excuse myself . You appear to me a little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to - morrow will bring , I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to - night . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" very cold , certainly very cold , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You do quite right , """
Emma Woodhouse	"she;--""we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" this is most strange!--After I had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination-- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with Mr. Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with Harriet ; but still , he can not refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked . What a strange thing love is ! he can see ready wit in Harriet , but will not dine alone for her . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Elton 's manners are not perfect , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" but where there is a wish to please , one ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great deal . Where a man does his best with only moderate powers , he will have the advantage over negligent superiority . There is such perfect good - temper and good - will in Mr. Elton as one can not but value . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Me ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton 's object ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Very true , my love , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Much the same-- not better . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" _ My _ report from Mrs. Goddard 's , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" was not so pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better ' was _ my _ answer . """
Emma Woodhouse	"answered--""My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , I hope ; but not even I can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed . Mr. Perry has been with her , as you probably heard . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report . But it is impossible not to feel uneasiness . Such a sad loss to our party to - day ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" but am disposed to side with you , Mr. Weston . If you think he will come , I shall think so too ; for you know Enscombe . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes -- I have some right to that knowledge ; though I have never been at the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow myself to speak ill of her , on Frank 's account ; for I do believe her to be very fond of him . I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body , except herself : but she has always been kind to him ( in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices , and expecting every thing to be as she likes ) . And it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though I would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain . I am sorry for it . The introduction must be unpleasant , whenever it takes place ; and the sooner it could be over , the better . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes ; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays . Even if this family , the Braithwaites , are put off , I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us . I can not bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves . There is jealousy . They are jealous even of his regard for his father . In short , I can feel no dependence on his coming , and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" He ought to come , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" If he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man 's not having it in his power to do as much as that . A young _ woman _ , if she fall into bad hands , may be teazed , and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with ; but one can not comprehend a young _ man _ 's being under such restraint , as not to be able to spend a week with his father , if he likes it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite . Now , according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _ him _ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I shall not be satisfied , unless he comes . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am very much astonished , Mr. Elton . This to _ me _ ! you forget yourself-- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _ me _ , if you please . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct ! and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner . Command yourself enough to say no more , and I will endeavour to forget it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is impossible for me to doubt any longer . You have made yourself too clear . Mr. Elton , my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express . After such behaviour , as I have witnessed during the last month , to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible ! Believe me , sir , I am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , sir , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" it confesses no such thing . So far from having long understood you , I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views , till this moment . As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings-- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared , ) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent . Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought seriously of her ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do not know why you should say so . He wishes exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" How odd you are ! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" That 's easily said , and easily felt by you , who have always been your own master . You are the worst judge in the world , Mr. Knightley , of the difficulties of dependence . You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes , sometimes he can . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is very unfair to judge of any body 's conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation . Nobody , who has not been in the interior of a family , can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be . We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe , and with Mrs. Churchill 's temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do . He may , at times , be able to do a great deal more than he can at others . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again . Such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use!--Nobody but you , Mr. Knightley , would imagine it possible . But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own . Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I rather doubt that . You are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , I think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones . I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr. Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill 's situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect . The Churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through . To him who has , it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence , and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought . He may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh , the difference of situation and habit ! I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" We shall never agree about him , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" but that is nothing extraordinary . I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : I feel sure that he is not . Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly , though in his own son ; but he is very likely to have a more yielding , complying , mild disposition than would suit your notions of man 's perfection . I dare say he has ; and though it may cut him off from some advantages , it will secure him many others . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Your feelings are singular . They seem to satisfy every body else . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You seem determined to think ill of him . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , if he have nothing else to recommend him , he will be a treasure at Highbury . We do not often look upon fine young men , well - bred and agreeable . We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain . Can not you imagine , Mr. Knightley , what a _ sensation _ his coming will produce ? There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury ; but one interest-- one object of curiosity ; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill ; we shall think and speak of nobody else . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" My idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable . To you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I will say no more about him , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" you turn every thing to evil . We are both prejudiced ; you against , I for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But I am very much , and without being at all ashamed of it . My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Elton is so good to the poor ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! yes -- Mr. Elton , I understand -- certainly as to dancing-- Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was-- Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of Jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , Jane is so very great a favourite there . Whenever she is with us , Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can . And so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , ` I know you can not have heard from Jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ; ' and when I immediately said , ` But indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning , ' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized . ` Have you , upon your honour ? ' said she ; ` well , that is quite unexpected . Do let me hear what she says . ' """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately ? I am extremely happy . I hope she is well ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"letter.--""Oh ! here it is . I was sure it could not be far off ; but I had put my huswife upon it , you see , without being aware , and so it was quite hid , but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table . I was reading it to Mrs. Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her-- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says;--but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see-- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half . My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well . She often says , when the letter is first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work'-- do n't you , ma'am?--And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her-- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word . And , indeed , though my mother 's eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank God ! with the help of spectacles . It is such a blessing ! My mother 's are really very good indeed . Jane often says , when she is here , ` I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish my eyes may last me as well . ' """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am afraid we must be running away , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve-- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am happy you approved , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield . """
Emma Woodhouse	"expressed--""I understand you well enough ; """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Miss Fairfax is reserved . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You think her diffident . I do not see it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! no ; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions ; and amused to think how little information I obtained . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" She is a sort of elegant creature that one can not keep one 's eyes from . I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Elton going to be married ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" He will have every body 's wishes for his happiness . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Who shall answer that question ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" My father would say ` yes , ' Mr. Knightley ` no ; ' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium . When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" nothing I suppose can be known . One feels that it can not be a very long acquaintance . He has been gone only four weeks . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You are silent , Miss Fairfax -- but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news . You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell 's account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Handsome ! Oh ! no -- far from it -- certainly plain . I told you he was plain . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! as for me , my judgment is worth nothing . Where I have a regard , I always think a person well - looking . But I gave what I believed the general opinion , when I called him plain . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away . The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy . You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave . This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed . I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole 's ; but I shall not stop three minutes : and , Jane , you had better go home directly -- I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already . Thank you , we do indeed . I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _ boiled _ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing . Good morning to you , my dear sir . Oh ! Mr. Knightley is coming too . Well , that is so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm.--Mr . Elton , and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning to you . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It might be distressing , for the moment , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never-- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" This is too bad , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so disappointed . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" We had better move on , Mr. Weston , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" we are detaining the girls . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?""--"
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dear , dear anxious friend,""--said"
Emma Woodhouse	""" always overcareful for every body 's comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" ' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here . I am sure they will bring him soon . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You can not see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" were you to guess her to be _ eighteen _ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _ she _ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words . Do n't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" she is a very elegant young woman . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I think you will to - day . You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes , oh ! yes""--he"
Emma Woodhouse	""" I was just going to mention it . A very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me . As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit . Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour . The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs. Weston , is it ? Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.-- A most deplorable want of complexion . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" there is no disputing about taste.--At least you admire her except her complexion . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I certainly do forget to think of _ her _ , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ever hear her ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You forget how much she belongs to Highbury . I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began . She plays charmingly . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Proof indeed ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"amused.--""Mr . Dixon is very musical , is he ? We shall know more about them all , in half an hour , from you , than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Certainly -- very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _ I _ had been Miss Campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me . I could not excuse a man 's having more music than love -- more ear than eye -- a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings . How did Miss Campbell appear to like it ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Poor comfort ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" One would rather have a stranger preferred than one 's very particular friend -- with a stranger it might not recur again -- but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself!-- Poor Mrs. Dixon ! Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" So much the better -- or so much the worse:--I do not know which . But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling -- there was one person , I think , who must have felt it : Miss Fairfax herself . She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax 's sensations from you , or from any body else . They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself . But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon , one may guess what one chuses . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends . But we never did . I hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set . And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way . Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it . Mr. Knightley , he is _ not _ a trifling , silly young man . If he were , he would have done this differently . He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it . There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.--No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" This is coming as you should do , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" like a gentleman.-- I am quite glad to see you . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me . I wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough . Depend upon it , we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , I am sure it is not from the Campbells . Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells , or they would have been guessed at first . She would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them . I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced . Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely . At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world . But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" He had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naivete . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" What is the matter ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Dear Mrs. Weston , how could you think of such a thing?--Mr . Knightley!--Mr . Knightley must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?-- Oh ! no , no , Henry must have Donwell . I can not at all consent to Mr. Knightley 's marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely . I am amazed that you should think of such a thing . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes , I would . I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.-- Mr. Knightley marry!--No , I have never had such an idea , and I can not adopt it now . And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But the imprudence of such a match ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I see no probability in it , unless you have any better foundation than what you mention . His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses . He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax-- and is always glad to shew them attention . My dear Mrs. Weston , do not take to match - making . You do it very ill . Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh ! no , no;--every feeling revolts . For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry . I am sure he has not the least idea of it . Do not put it into his head . Why should he marry?-- He is as happy as possible by himself ; with his farm , and his sheep , and his library , and all the parish to manage ; and he is extremely fond of his brother 's children . He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Nonsense ! He does not care about Jane Fairfax . In the way of love , I am sure he does not . He would do any good to her , or her family ; but-- """
Emma Woodhouse	""" If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion . How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey , and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?-- ` So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour ! ' And then fly off , through half a sentence , to her mother 's old petticoat . ` Not that it was such a very old petticoat either -- for still it would last a great while -- and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong . ' """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love . But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do . Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You take up an idea , Mrs. Weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing . I see no sign of attachment-- I believe nothing of the pianoforte -- and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I often feel concern , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions . It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" This present from the Campbells , """
Emma Woodhouse	"she--""this pianoforte is very kindly given . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am here on no business of my own , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am only waiting for my friend . She will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home . But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do not believe any such thing , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates , & c. , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I declare I can not recollect what I was talking of.--Oh ! my mother 's spectacles . So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill ! ` Oh ! ' said he , ` I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively . '--Which you know shewed him to be so very . . . . Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing . . . . I do congratulate you , Mrs. Weston , most warmly . He seems every thing the fondest parent could . . . . ` Oh ! ' said he , ` I can fasten the rivet . I like a job of that sort excessively . ' I never shall forget his manner . And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ` Oh ! ' said he directly , ` there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good , and these are the finest - looking home - baked apples I ever saw in my life . ' That , you know , was so very . . . . And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment . Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times-- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it . The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from Donwell -- some of Mr. Knightley 's most liberal supply . He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- I believe there is two of them . My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days . But I was really quite shocked the other day-- for Mr. Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock . ` I am sure you must be , ' said he , ` and I will send you another supply ; for I have a great many more than I can ever use . William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year . I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing . ' So I begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same . And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me -- No , I should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could . However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose . William Larkins is such an old acquaintance ! I am always glad to see him . But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _ that _ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil . William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master 's profit than any thing ; but Mrs. Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away . She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple - tart this spring . He told Patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for Mrs. Hodges _ would _ be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed ! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world ! He would be so very . . . . I wanted to keep it from Jane 's knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Pray take care , Mrs. Weston , there is a step at the turning . Pray take care , Miss Woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase-- rather darker and narrower than one could wish . Miss Smith , pray take care . Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot . Miss Smith , the step at the turning . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is not fair , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" mine was a random guess . Do not distress her . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You speak too plain . She must understand you . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" She is not entirely without it , I think . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , no , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" you are quite unreasonable . It would be dreadful to be standing so close ! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd -- and a crowd in a little room ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over . There is no hurry at all . If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses . They will be so near their own stable . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs. Weston 's care . Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Aye , very true . Mr. Perry did say so . I shall never forget it . Poor little Emma ! You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry 's great attention . He came four times a day for a week . He said , from the first , it was a very good sort -- which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint . I hope whenever poor Isabella 's little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Emma , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" this paper is worse than I expected . Look ! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing . She will not even listen to your questions . I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Very well . If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.-- Oh ! yes , I must be there ; I could not refuse ; and I will keep as much awake as I can ; but I would rather be at home , looking over William Larkins 's week 's account ; much rather , I confess.-- Pleasure in seeing dancing!--not I , indeed -- I never look at it-- I do not know who does.--Fine dancing , I believe , like virtue , must be its own reward . Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball . What a disappointment it would be ! I do look forward to it , I own , with _ very _ great pleasure . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But you will come again , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" This will not be your only visit to Randalls . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Our poor ball must be quite given up . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Indeed , I am very sorry to be right in this instance . I would much rather have been merry than wise . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" As you do us such ample justice now , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ? Do not we rather surpass your expectations ? I am sure we do . I am sure you did not much expect to like us . You would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I certainly must , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing 's being dull and insipid about the house!-- I must be in love ; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not -- for a few weeks at least . Well ! evil to some is always good to others . I shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball , if not for Frank Churchill ; but Mr. Knightley will be happy . He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes . """
Emma Woodhouse	"words--""I had not a spare moment on Tuesday , as you know , for Miss Woodhouse 's beautiful little friend . Pray make my excuses and adieus to her . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton 's marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _ me _ . You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into . It was all my doing , I know . I have not forgotten it , I assure you.--Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you-- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever . Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity . These are the motives which I have been pressing on you . They are very important -- and sorry I am that you can not feel them sufficiently to act upon them . My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration . I want you to save yourself from greater pain . Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life-- Want gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I do for you!--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" There is nothing to be compared to it . Warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , I am sure it will . It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives Isabella all her popularity.-- I have it not -- but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives . Dear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing . Oh ! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a hundred such -- And for a wife-- a sensible man 's wife -- it is invaluable . I mention no names ; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" elegantly dressed , and very pleasing . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" We can not suppose , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" that Mr. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _ very _ musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But you , who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger , surely ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But every thing of that kind , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" will soon be in so regular a train-- """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mrs. Weston 's manners , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" were always particularly good . Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Insufferable woman ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Worse than I had supposed . Absolutely insufferable ! Knightley!--I could not have believed it . Knightley!--never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman ! A little upstart , vulgar being , with her Mr. E. , and her _ caro _ _ sposo _ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery . Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman ! I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady . I could not have believed it ! And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club ! One would fancy we were bosom friends ! And Mrs. Weston!-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman ! Worse and worse . I never met with her equal . Much beyond my hopes . Harriet is disgraced by any comparison . Oh ! what would Frank Churchill say to her , if he were here ? How angry and how diverted he would be ! Ah ! there I am-- thinking of him directly . Always the first person to be thought of ! How I catch myself out ! Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind!""--"
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dear , you do not understand me . This is a matter of mere common politeness and good - breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I can not think there is any danger of it , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" She must have some motive , more powerful than appears , for refusing this invitation , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" She must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the Campbells or herself . There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere.-- She is _ not _ to be with the _ Dixons _ . The decree is issued by somebody . But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" We can not suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma -- but it is better than being always at home . Her aunt is a good creature , but , as a constant companion , must be very tiresome . We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits , before we condemn her taste for what she goes to . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Such attentions as Mrs. Elton 's , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax . Mrs. Elton 's invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And yet , """
Emma Woodhouse	"on--""And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is . The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You are not vain , Mr. Knightley . I will say that for you . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" and you soon silenced Mr. Cole , I suppose ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton , who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world ! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles-- what she calls them ! How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ? She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do for Mr. Cole ? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . Mrs. Weston , your argument weighs most with me . I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax 's mind over Mrs. Elton . I have no faith in Mrs. Elton 's acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding . I can not imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau . """
Emma Woodhouse	"Knightley--""I do not accuse her of want of feeling . Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness . She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be -- And I love an open temper . No -- till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head . I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , Mrs. Weston , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" what do you say now to Mr. Knightley 's marrying Jane Fairfax ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Why , really , dear Emma , I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _ not _ being in love with her , that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last . Do not beat me . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I see how it is , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I see what a life I am to lead among you . Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated . We really seem quite the fashion . If this is living in the country , it is nothing very formidable . From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" She would rather not be in his company more than she could help . She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable . If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" This is very true , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful.--Of the same age-- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend.-- She will never like me now . I have neglected her too long . But I will shew her greater attention than I have done . """
Emma Woodhouse	"again--""Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman 's hands I ever saw . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" If we were in the other room , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen . I have a note of his.-- Do not you remember , Mrs. Weston , employing him to write for you one day ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I rather hope to satisfy you both , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" for I shall do all in my power to make them happy , which will be enough for Isabella ; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" That is very likely . You think so , do not you ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Increase ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Difference ! No indeed I am not . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon my word , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" you amuse me ! I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys . These amazing engagements of mine-- what have they been ? Dining once with the Coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place . I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed . But you , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) who know how very , very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , I can not imagine . And as to my dear little boys , I must say , that if Aunt Emma has not time for them , I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley , who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one-- and who , when he is at home , is either reading to himself or settling his accounts . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed-- he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word -- but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry off . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" So unreasonably early ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" How do you like Mrs. Elton ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured , I declare . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Jane , Jane , my dear Jane , where are you?--Here is your tippet . Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet . She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage , though every thing has been done -- One door nailed up -- Quantities of matting -- My dear Jane , indeed you must . Mr. Churchill , oh ! you are too obliging ! How well you put it on!--so gratified ! Excellent dancing indeed!-- Yes , my dear , I ran home , as I said I should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me.--I set off without saying a word , just as I told you . Grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners . ` Oh ! ' said I , ` I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr. Elton , I do not know who will ask her next , perhaps Mr. William Cox . ' My dear sir , you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am not helpless . Sir , you are most kind . Upon my word , Jane on one arm , and me on the other!--Stop , stop , let us stand a little back , Mrs. Elton is going ; dear Mrs. Elton , how elegant she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train . Quite the queen of the evening!--Well , here we are at the passage . Two steps , Jane , take care of the two steps . Oh ! no , there is but one . Well , I was persuaded there were two . How very odd ! I was convinced there were two , and there is but one . I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style -- Candles everywhere.--I was telling you of your grandmama , Jane,--There was a little disappointment.-- The baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good Mr. Woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again . Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus-- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned!--Well , this is brilliant ! I am all amazement ! could not have supposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since-- Well , where shall we sit ? where shall we sit ? Anywhere , so that Jane is not in a draught . Where _ I _ sit is of no consequence . Oh ! do you recommend this side?--Well , I am sure , Mr. Churchill-- only it seems too good -- but just as you please . What you direct in this house can not be wrong . Dear Jane , how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama ? Soup too ! Bless me ! I should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and I can not help beginning . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I did , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" and they can not forgive me . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am ready , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" whenever I am wanted . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" With you , if you will ask me . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Brother and sister ! no , indeed . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I hope I do . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dearest Harriet ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear . Remember it ? Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic -- I knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me!--Oh ! my sins , my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)-- go on -- what else ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Lord bless me ! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about ! I never was equal to this . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" This was really his , """
Emma Woodhouse	"Harriet.--""Do not you remember one morning?--no , I dare say you do not . But one morning -- I forget exactly the day -- but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _ that _ _ evening _ , he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket - book ; it was about spruce - beer . Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce - beer , and he wanted to put it down ; but when he took out his pencil , there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away , and it would not do , so you lent him another , and this was left upon the table as good for nothing . But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do remember it , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I perfectly remember it.-- Talking about spruce - beer.--Oh ! yes -- Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr. Elton 's seeming resolved to learn to like it too . I perfectly remember it.--Stop ; Mr. Knightley was standing just here , was not he ? I have an idea he was standing just here . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ah ! I do not know . I can not recollect.--It is very odd , but I can not recollect.--Mr . Elton was sitting here , I remember , much about where I am now . ""--"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , go on . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! that 's all . I have nothing more to shew you , or to say-- except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and I wish you to see me do it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" My poor dear Harriet ! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes , simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now , and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them . It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married . I knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But , Harriet , is it necessary to burn the court - plaister?--I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court - plaister might be useful . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And when , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so""--and"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Never marry!--This is a new resolution . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is one that I shall never change , however . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I hope it does not proceed from-- I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton ? """
Emma Woodhouse	"indignantly.--""Oh ! no""--and"
Emma Woodhouse	""" so superior to Mr. Elton ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning . Your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you . Is not it so ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , believe me I have not the presumption to suppose-- Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance -- and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world , with the gratitude , wonder , and veneration , which are so proper , in me especially . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am not at all surprized at you , Harriet . The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Service ! oh ! it was such an inexpressible obligation!-- The very recollection of it , and all that I felt at the time-- when I saw him coming -- his noble look -- and my wretchedness before . Such a change ! In one moment such a change ! From perfect misery to perfect happiness ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is very natural . It is natural , and it is honourable.-- Yes , honourable , I think , to chuse so well and so gratefully.-- But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise . I do not advise you to give way to it , Harriet . I do not by any means engage for its being returned . Consider what you are about . Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you . Be observant of him . Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations . I give you this caution now , because I shall never speak to you again on the subject . I am determined against all interference . Henceforward I know nothing of the matter . Let no name ever pass our lips . We were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now.--He is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , Harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity . But take care of yourself . I would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _ him _ , is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Nonsense ! for shame ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Never , never ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"eagerness--""Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me . And how could it possibly come into your head ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! you amuse me excessively . I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do-- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do . There is no admiration between them , I do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather of a totally different nature-- it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of nonsense in it -- but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be . That is , I _ presume _ it to be so on her side , and I can _ answer _ for its being so on his . I will answer for the gentleman 's indifference . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now . I must order the carriage . The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already . """
Emma Woodhouse	"answered--""I am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits . Mine , I confess , are exhausted . The greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that I am gone when it is necessary . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone!""--seemed"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Such a home , indeed ! such an aunt ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do pity you . And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more I shall like you . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You will soon be cooler , if you sit still , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No -- he should not eat . He was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am glad I have done being in love with him . I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning . Harriet 's sweet easy temper will not mind it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes , you were very cross ; and I do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries . I was a kinder friend than you deserved . But you were humble . You begged hard to be commanded to come . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is hotter to - day . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You are comfortable because you are under command . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Perhaps I intended you to say so , but I meant self - command . You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as I can not be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Dating from three o'clock yesterday . My perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Your gallantry is really unanswerable . But ( lowering her voice)-- nobody speaks except ourselves , and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Our companions are excessively stupid . What shall we do to rouse them ? Any nonsense will serve . They _ shall _ talk . Ladies and gentlemen , I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse ( who , wherever she is , presides ) to say , that she desires to know what you are all thinking of ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! no , no""--cried"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon no account in the world . It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now . Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of . I will not say quite all . There are one or two , perhaps , ( glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet , ) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , no , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" it will not reckon low . A conundrum of Mr. Weston 's shall clear him and his next neighbour . Come , sir , pray let me hear it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" What two letters!--express perfection ! I am sure I do not know . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" The ladies were all at home . """
Emma Woodhouse	"came--""Very happy and obliged""--but"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ah ! Miss Woodhouse , how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard-- and are come to give us joy . This does not seem much like joy , indeed , in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be very trying for us to part with her , after having had her so long , and she has a dreadful headache just now , writing all the morning:-- such long letters , you know , to be written to Colonel Campbell , and Mrs. Dixon . ` My dear , ' said I , ` you will blind yourself'-- for tears were in her eyes perpetually . One can not wonder , one can not wonder . It is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , I suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , Miss Woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing her tears)--but , poor dear soul ! if you were to see what a headache she has . When one is in great pain , you know one can not feel any blessing quite as it may deserve . She is as low as possible . To look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation . You will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room-- I want her to lie down upon the bed . ` My dear , ' said I , ` I shall say you are laid down upon the bed : ' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room . But , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well . She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her . You were kept waiting at the door -- I was quite ashamed-- but somehow there was a little bustle -- for it so happened that we had not heard the knock , and till you were on the stairs , we did not know any body was coming . ` It is only Mrs. Cole , ' said I , ` depend upon it . Nobody else would come so early . ' ` Well , ' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now . ' But then Patty came in , and said it was you . ` Oh ! ' said I , ` it is Miss Woodhouse : I am sure you will like to see her . '-- ` I can see nobody , ' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were . ` If you must go , my dear , ' said I , ` you must , and I will say you are laid down upon the bed . ' """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ah ! madam , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself , I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not Colonel and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ; """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Miss Fairfax 's compliments and thanks , but is quite unequal to any exercise . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Now,""--said"
Emma Woodhouse	""" now Mr. Weston , do let me know what has happened . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , no,""--he"
Emma Woodhouse	"replied.--""Don't ask me . I promised my wife to leave it all to her . She will break it to you better than I can . Do not be impatient , Emma ; it will all come out too soon . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Break it to me , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Good God!--Mr . Weston , tell me at once.--Something has happened in Brunswick Square . I know it has . Tell me , I charge you tell me this moment what it is . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , indeed you are mistaken . ""--"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square . Which of them is it?-- I charge you by all that is sacred , not to attempt concealment . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon my word , Emma . ""--"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour , that it has nothing to do with any of them ? Good Heavens!--What can be to be _ broke _ to me , that does not relate to one of that family ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Who is that gentleman on horseback ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank , I assure you . You will not see him . He is half way to Windsor by this time . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Has your son been with you , then ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! yes -- did not you know?--Well , well , never mind . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day , before I can at all comprehend it . What!--engaged to her all the winter-- before either of them came to Highbury ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me , Emma , very much . It has hurt his father equally . _ Some _ _ part _ of his conduct we can not excuse . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I will not pretend _ not _ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast , of my present perfect indifference , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I will farther tell you , that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance , when I did like him , when I was very much disposed to be attached to him -- nay , was attached -- and how it came to cease , is perhaps the wonder . Fortunately , however , it did cease . I have really for some time past , for at least these three months , cared nothing about him . You may believe me , Mrs. Weston . This is the simple truth . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Good God ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" _ His _ sufferings , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" do not appear to have done him much harm . Well , and how did Mr. Churchill take it ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ah ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" he would have done as much for Harriet . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells , the Dixons , did none of them know of the engagement ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Well , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea , and I wish them very happy . But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding . What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage , and treachery?-- To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge us all!--Here have we been , the whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour , with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take the consequence , if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Much , indeed ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax's.--Of such , one may almost say , that ` the world is not their 's , nor the world 's law . ' """
Emma Woodhouse	""" For the present , the whole affair was to be completely a secret . Mr. Churchill had made a point of it , as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost ; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum . ""--"
Emma Woodhouse	""" What news do you mean ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" What did Mr. Weston tell you?""--said"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while . How very odd ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon my word , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I begin to doubt my having any such talent . Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly-- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr. Frank Churchill 's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax . You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Harriet ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"pause--""What do you mean?-- Good Heaven ! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?-- """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Harriet ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Not quite , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person . I could almost assert that you had _ named _ Mr. Frank Churchill . I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , was spoken of . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" My dear Harriet , I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion . I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Good God ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" this has been a most unfortunate-- most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ? At least , however , I can not be worse off than I should have been , if the other had been the person ; and now -- it _ is _ possible-- """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do not wonder , Miss Woodhouse , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body . You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other . But I hope , Miss Woodhouse , that supposing -- that if-- strange as it may appear-- . But you know they were your own words , that _ more _ wonderful things had happened , matches of _ greater _ disparity had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me ; and , therefore , it seems as if such a thing even as this , may have occurred before-- and if I should be so fortunate , beyond expression , as to-- if Mr. Knightley should really -- if _ he _ does not mind the disparity , I hope , dear Miss Woodhouse , you will not set yourself against it , and try to put difficulties in the way . But you are too good for that , I am sure . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley 's returning your affection ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh God ! that I had never seen her ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Poor girl ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Poor girl ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" She loves him then excessively , I suppose . It must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement . Her affection must have overpowered her judgment . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am afraid , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" On your side , my love , it was very innocently done . But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before . One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" was that of making her _ unreasonable _ . The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been-- that had been -- hard for him to bear . ` I did not make the allowances , ' said she , ` which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits-- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first . ' She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good . She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" If I did not know her to be happy now , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" which , in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience , she must be , I could not bear these thanks;--for , oh ! Mrs. Weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ) , this is all to be forgotten . You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars . They shew her to the greatest advantage . I am sure she is very good-- I hope she will be very happy . It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" How d'ye do 's """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" How is it possible ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" _ You _ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it -- but--(with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Knightley , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am in a very extraordinary situation . I can not let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.-- But I never have . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased.-- An old story , probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding . Many circumstances assisted the temptation . He was the son of Mr. Weston -- he was continually here -- I always found him very pleasant -- and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered , and I allowed his attentions . Latterly , however -- for some time , indeed-- I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side . He has imposed on me , but he has not injured me . I have never been attached to him . And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour . He never wished to attach me . It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another.--It was his object to blind all about him ; and no one , I am sure , could be more effectually blinded than myself -- except that I was _ not _ blinded -- that it was my good fortune -- that , in short , I was somehow or other safe from him . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have no doubt of their being happy together , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You speak as if you envied him . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! then , do n't speak it , do n't speak it , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No,""--replied"
Emma Woodhouse	"spoke--""I should like to take another turn . Mr. Perry is not gone . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr. Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me.--I will hear whatever you like . I will tell you exactly what I think . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And I have not forgotten , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would . You pass it over very handsomely-- but you were perfectly right . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Very bad -- though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous game . Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.-- No judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his own wishes , and regardless of little besides his own convenience.-- Fancying you to have fathomed his secret . Natural enough!-- his own mind full of intrigue , that he should suspect it in others.--Mystery ; Finesse -- how they pervert the understanding ! My Emma , does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You had better go on , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" While her dear father lived , any change of condition must be impossible for her . She could never quit him . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ah ! there is one difficulty unprovided for , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am sure William Larkins will not like it . You must get his consent before you ask mine . """
Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	""" I mentioned no _ names _ , you will observe.--Oh ! no ; cautious as a minister of state . I managed it extremely well . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit?--(here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane . ) Upon my word , Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!-- Oh ! if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst!""--"
Emma Woodhouse	""" Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Have not you mistaken the day ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to - morrow.--Mr . Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for Saturday . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon my word , my dear , I do not know , for I never heard the subject talked of . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Ah ! you clever creature , that 's very true . What a thinking brain you have ! I say , Jane , what a perfect character you and I should make , if we could be shaken together . My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate , however , that _ some _ people may not think _ you _ perfection already.--But hush!-- not a word , if you please . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility . Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! you are too scrupulous , indeed you are , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even-- """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Pray say no more . I feel that all the apologies should be on my side . Let us forgive each other at once . We must do whatever is to be done quickest , and I think our feelings will lose no time there . I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And the next news , I suppose , will be , that we are to lose you-- just as I begin to know you . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps , """
Emma Woodhouse	"smiling--""but , excuse me , it must be thought of . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Thank you , thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured of.-- Oh ! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!-- Good - bye , good - bye . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Poor child ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" at that rate , what will become of her ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people . I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am sure you were of use to me , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I was very often influenced rightly by you -- oftener than I would own at the time . I am very sure you did me good . And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I remember once calling you ` George , ' in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago . I did it because I thought it would offend you ; but , as you made no objection , I never did it again . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" He writes like a sensible man , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I honour his sincerity . It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already . Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Good or bad ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , this is impossible ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were the same . But in time they will . Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You mistake me , you quite mistake me , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I can not believe it . It seems an impossibility!--You can not mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin . You can not mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet . You only mean , that he intends it . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Good God ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	""" Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But , Mr. Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _ accepted _ him . I could suppose she might in time -- but can she already?-- Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him?--It was not Harriet 's hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! I always deserve the best treatment , because I never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer . Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am perfectly satisfied , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" and most sincerely wish them happy . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I hope so -- for at that time I was a fool . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" And I am changed also ; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet 's good qualities . I have taken some pains for your sake , and for Robert Martin 's sake , ( whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever , ) to get acquainted with her . I have often talked to her a good deal . You must have seen that I did . Sometimes , indeed , I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin 's cause , which was never the case ; but , from all my observations , I am convinced of her being an artless , amiable girl , with very good notions , very seriously good principles , and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.-- Much of this , I have no doubt , she may thank you for . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Me ! """
Emma Woodhouse	"head.--""Ah ! poor Harriet ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" No , indeed , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" not in the least . I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you -- and to give you joy in person . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I can never think of it , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" without extreme shame . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" It is not now worth a regret , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I have always admired her complexion , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?-- When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time , you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.-- I am sure it was a consolation to you . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Oh ! no , no , no -- how can you suspect me of such a thing ? I was the most miserable wretch ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth . I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation . I think there is a little likeness between us . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Very beautiful , indeed , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" How delighted I am to see you again ! and to see you in such excellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world . I should certainly have called at Hartfield , had you failed to come . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" He is very plain , undoubtedly -- remarkably plain:--but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility . I had no right to expect much , and I did not expect much ; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish , so totally without air . I had imagined him , I confess , a degree or two nearer gentility . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin . At Hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men . I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before . Do not you begin to feel that now ? Were not you struck ? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Mr. Knightley 's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with _ him _ . You might not see one in a hundred with _ gentleman _ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley . But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to . What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton ? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _ them _ . Compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent . You must see the difference . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Which makes his good manners the more valuable . The older a person grows , Harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes . What is passable in youth is detestable in later age . Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at Mr. Weston 's time of life ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" But there may be pretty good guessing . He will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Will he , indeed ? That will be very bad . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended . He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else -- which is just as it should be , for a thriving man . What has he to do with books ? And I have no doubt that he _ will _ thrive , and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _ us _ . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I wonder he did not remember the book""--was"
Emma Woodhouse	""""
Emma Woodhouse	""" Will you be so kind , """
Emma Woodhouse	""" when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly.--I have said nothing about it to any body . It would only be giving trouble and distress . Some are gone to the ponds , and some to the lime walk . Till they all come in I shall not be missed ; and when they do , will you have the goodness to say that I am gone ? """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Yes -- what should hurt me?--I walk fast . I shall be at home in twenty minutes . """
Emma Woodhouse	""" Thank you , thank you -- but on no account.--I would rather walk.-- And for _ me _ to be afraid of walking alone!--I , who may so soon have to guard others ! """
Emma Woodhouse	""" I am,""--she"
George Knightley	""" My dearest papa ! You do not think I could mean _ you _ , or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean _ you _ . What a horrible idea ! Oh no ! I meant only myself . Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know-- in a joke -- it is all a joke . We always say what we like to one another . """
George Knightley	""" Emma knows I never flatter her , """
George Knightley	""" but I meant no reflection on any body . Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one . The chances are that she must be a gainer . """
George Knightley	"pass--""you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly . Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen . Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day . """
George Knightley	""" It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion , """
George Knightley	""" We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor 's advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor 's time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore can not allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married . """
George Knightley	""" Ah ! my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass . Pray do not make any more matches . """
George Knightley	""" Ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell 's , I made up my mind on the subject . I planned the match from that hour ; and when such success has blessed me in this instance , dear papa , you can not think that I shall leave off match - making . """
George Knightley	""" I do not understand what you mean by ` success , ' """
George Knightley	""" Success supposes endeavour . Your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage . A worthy employment for a young lady 's mind ! But if , which I rather imagine , your making the match , as you call it , means only your planning it , your saying to yourself one idle day , ` I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her , ' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards , why do you talk of success ? Where is your merit ? What are you proud of ? You made a lucky guess ; and _ that _ is all that can be said . """
George Knightley	""" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?-- I pity you.--I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck . There is always some talent in it . And as to my poor word ` success , ' which you quarrel with , I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it . You have drawn two pretty pictures ; but I think there may be a third -- a something between the do - nothing and the do - all . If I had not promoted Mr. Weston 's visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all . I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that . """
George Knightley	""" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns . You are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference . """
George Knightley	""" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr. Elton . Poor Mr. Elton ! You like Mr. Elton , papa,--I must look about for a wife for him . There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him -- and he has been here a whole year , and has fitted up his house so comfortably , that it would be a shame to have him single any longer -- and I thought when he was joining their hands to - day , he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him ! I think very well of Mr. Elton , and this is the only way I have of doing him a service . """
George Knightley	""" With a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time , """
George Knightley	""" and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing . Invite him to dinner , Emma , and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken , but leave him to chuse his own wife . Depend upon it , a man of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself . """
George Knightley	""" I do not know what your opinion may be , Mrs. Weston , """
George Knightley	""" of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith , but I think it a bad thing . """
George Knightley	""" I think they will neither of them do the other any good . """
George Knightley	""" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle . """
George Knightley	""" Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old . I have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule . The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now . But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma . She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding . Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate , I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not . """
George Knightley	""" There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _ that_,""--said"
George Knightley	""" But I , """
George Knightley	""" who have had no such charm thrown over my senses , must still see , hear , and remember . Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family . At ten years old , she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen . She was always quick and assured : Isabella slow and diffident . And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all . In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her . She inherits her mother 's talents , and must have been under subjection to her . """
George Knightley	""" I should have been sorry , Mr. Knightley , to be dependent on _ your _ recommendation , had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse 's family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body . I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held . """
George Knightley	""" Thank you . There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr. Weston . """
George Knightley	""" I hope not _ that_.--It is not likely . No , Mr. Knightley , do not foretell vexation from that quarter . """
George Knightley	""" I either depend more upon Emma 's good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I can not lament the acquaintance . How well she looked last night ! """
George Knightley	""" Pretty ! say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether -- face and figure ? """
George Knightley	""" Such an eye!--the true hazle eye -- and so brilliant ! regular features , open countenance , with a complexion ! oh ! what a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ` the picture of health ; ' now , Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown - up health . She is loveliness itself . Mr. Knightley , is not she ? """
George Knightley	""" And I , Mr. Knightley , am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm . With all dear Emma 's little faults , she is an excellent creature . Where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ? No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times . """
George Knightley	""" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma 's mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith 's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you . Pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it can not be expected that Emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself . It has been so many years my province to give advice , that you can not be surprized , Mr. Knightley , at this little remains of office . """
George Knightley	""" Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister . """
George Knightley	""" She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all . But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for . It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object . I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good . But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home . """
George Knightley	""" You have made her too tall , Emma , """
George Knightley	""" Well , I believe , if you will excuse me , Mr. Knightley , if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing , I shall take Emma 's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour . As the sun is out , I believe I had better take my three turns while I can . I treat you without ceremony , Mr. Knightley . We invalids think we are privileged people . """
George Knightley	""" My dear sir , do not make a stranger of me . """
George Knightley	""" I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter . Emma will be happy to entertain you . And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk . """
George Knightley	""" You can not do better , sir . """
George Knightley	""" I would ask for the pleasure of your company , Mr. Knightley , but I am a very slow walker , and my pace would be tedious to you ; and , besides , you have another long walk before you , to Donwell Abbey . """
George Knightley	""" Thank you , sir , thank you ; I am going this moment myself ; and I think the sooner _ you _ go the better . I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you . """
George Knightley	""" I can not rate her beauty as you do , """
George Knightley	""" but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition . Her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman . """
George Knightley	""" I am glad you think so ; and the good hands , I hope , may not be wanting . """
George Knightley	""" Come , """
George Knightley	""" you are anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you that you have improved her . You have cured her of her school - girl 's giggle ; she really does you credit . """
George Knightley	""" Thank you . I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may . _ You _ do not often overpower me with it . """
George Knightley	""" You are expecting her again , you say , this morning ? """
George Knightley	""" Almost every moment . She has been gone longer already than she intended . """
George Knightley	""" Something has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps . """
George Knightley	""" Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches ! """
George Knightley	""" Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would . """
George Knightley	""" I have reason to think , """
George Knightley	""" that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert Martin is the man . Her visit to Abbey - Mill , this summer , seems to have done his business . He is desperately in love and means to marry her . """
George Knightley	""" Well , well , means to make her an offer then . Will that do ? He came to the Abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it . He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , I believe , considers me as one of his best friends . He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether I thought her too young : in short , whether I approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _ your _ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him . I was very much pleased with all that he said . I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin . He always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging . He told me every thing ; his circumstances and plans , and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage . He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother . I had no hesitation in advising him to marry . He proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , I was convinced he could not do better . I praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy . If he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , I dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had . This happened the night before last . Now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard 's to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch . """
George Knightley	""" Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her . What is the foolish girl about ? """
George Knightley	""" Nonsense ! a man does not imagine any such thing . But what is the meaning of this ? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin ? madness , if it is so ; but I hope you are mistaken . """
George Knightley	""" You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too . Emma , this is your doing . You persuaded her to refuse him . """
George Knightley	""" Not Harriet 's equal ! """
George Knightley	""" Whoever might be her parents , """
George Knightley	""" whoever may have had the charge of her , it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society . After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard 's hands to shift as she can;--to move , in short , in Mrs. Goddard 's line , to have Mrs. Goddard 's acquaintance . Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _ was _ good enough . She desired nothing better herself . Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it . She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer . She had no sense of superiority then . If she has it now , you have given it . You have been no friend to Harriet Smith , Emma . Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him . I know him well . He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion . And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know . Depend upon it he had encouragement . """
George Knightley	""" I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy , """
George Knightley	""" though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet . You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her . Vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief . Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high . Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl . Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives . Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed . Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour - boarder at Mrs. Goddard 's all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other , ) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master 's son . """
George Knightley	""" Just as it should be , """
George Knightley	""" and just as I hoped it was from your letters . Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy . I have been always telling you , my love , that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have Emma 's account , I hope you will be satisfied . """
George Knightley	""" I think , indeed , """
George Knightley	""" that Mr. Weston has some little claim . You and I , Emma , will venture to take the part of the poor husband . I , being a husband , and you not being a wife , the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force . As for Isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can . """
George Knightley	""" Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be , or can be , a greater advocate for matrimony than I am ; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield , I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world ; and as to slighting Mr. Weston , that excellent Mr. Weston , I think there is nothing he does not deserve . I believe he is one of the very best - tempered men that ever existed . Excepting yourself and your brother , I do not know his equal for temper . I shall never forget his flying Henry 's kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o'clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham , I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him , it must be Miss Taylor . """
George Knightley	""" Where is the young man ? """
George Knightley	""" Has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not ? """
George Knightley	""" Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills , I fancy , """
George Knightley	""" But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John . Mr. Weston is rather an easy , cheerful - tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , I suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords . """
George Knightley	""" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces . As to men and women , our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard to these children , I observe we never disagree . """
George Knightley	""" If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women , and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them , as you are where these children are concerned , we might always think alike . """
George Knightley	""" To be sure -- our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong . """
George Knightley	""" A material difference then , """
George Knightley	""" Yes -- a good deal _ nearer _ . """
George Knightley	""" I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child . Come , my dear Emma , let us be friends , and say no more about it . Tell your aunt , little Emma , that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances , and that if she were not wrong before , she is now . """
George Knightley	"cried--""very true . Little Emma , grow up a better woman than your aunt . Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited . Now , Mr. Knightley , a word or two more , and I have done . As far as good intentions went , we were _ both _ right , and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong . I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very , very bitterly disappointed . """
George Knightley	""" Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come , shake hands with me . """
George Knightley	""" How d'ye do , George ? """
George Knightley	""" John , how are you ? """
George Knightley	""" What is the matter , sir?--Did you speak to me ? """
George Knightley	""" I am sorry to find , my love , that my father does not think you looking well -- but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued . I could have wished , however , as you know , that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you left home . """
George Knightley	""" My dear Isabella,""--exclaimed"
George Knightley	"hastily--""pray do not concern yourself about my looks . Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children , and let me look as I chuse . """
George Knightley	""" True , true , """
George Knightley	""" very true . That 's a consideration indeed.--But John , as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , I can not conceive any difficulty . I should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path . . . . The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps . I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion . """
George Knightley	""" I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr. Elton . It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned . With men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works . """
George Knightley	""" Yes , """
George Knightley	""" he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you . """
George Knightley	""" Such an imagination has crossed me , I own , Emma ; and if it never occurred to you before , you may as well take it into consideration now . """
George Knightley	""" I do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly . I think your manners to him encouraging . I speak as a friend , Emma . You had better look about you , and ascertain what you do , and what you mean to do . """
George Knightley	""" Yes , """
George Knightley	""" and I think we shall have a good deal of it . """
George Knightley	""" I can not wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls . """
George Knightley	""" We are sure of excellent fires , """
George Knightley	""" and every thing in the greatest comfort . Charming people , Mr. and Mrs. Weston;-- Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society;-- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any . Mr. Weston 's dining - room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , I would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two . I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma , ) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr. Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings . """
George Knightley	""" I know nothing of the large parties of London , sir -- I never dine with any body . """
George Knightley	""" Indeed ! ( in a tone of wonder and pity , ) I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery . Well , sir , the time must come when you will be paid for all this , when you will have little labour and great enjoyment . """
George Knightley	""" My first enjoyment , """
George Knightley	""" will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again . """
George Knightley	""" The Churchills are very likely in fault , """
George Knightley	""" but I dare say he might come if he would . """
George Knightley	""" I can not believe that he has not the power of coming , if he made a point of it . It is too unlikely , for me to believe it without proof . """
George Knightley	""" I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions , and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure , from living with those who have always set him the example of it . It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too . If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between September and January . A man at his age -- what is he?--three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that . It is impossible . """
George Knightley	""" It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four - and - twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount . He can not want money -- he can not want leisure . We know , on the contrary , that he has so much of both , that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom . We hear of him for ever at some watering - place or other . A little while ago , he was at Weymouth . This proves that he can leave the Churchills . """
George Knightley	""" And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while ; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure . """
George Knightley	""" There is one thing , Emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution . It is Frank Churchill 's duty to pay this attention to his father . He knows it to be so , by his promises and messages ; but if he wished to do it , it might be done . A man who felt rightly would say at once , simply and resolutely , to Mrs. Churchill-- ` Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience ; but I must go and see my father immediately . I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion . I shall , therefore , set off to - morrow . '-- If he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going . """
George Knightley	""" Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it . He would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration -- made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner-- would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do . Respect would be added to affection . They would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims . Respect for right conduct is felt by every body . If he would act in this sort of manner , on principle , consistently , regularly , their little minds would bend to his . """
George Knightley	""" Then it would not be so strong a sense . If it failed to produce equal exertion , it could not be an equal conviction . """
George Knightley	""" Our amiable young man is a very weak young man , if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others . It ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency . I can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man . As he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority . He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father . Had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now . """
George Knightley	""" Yes ; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move , and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure , and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it . He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father 's having any right to complain . His letters disgust me . """
George Knightley	""" I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston . They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother 's place , but without a mother 's affection to blind her . It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due , and she must doubly feel the omission . Had she been a person of consequence herself , he would have come I dare say ; and it would not have signified whether he did or no . Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ? No , Emma , your amiable young man can be amiable only in French , not in English . He may be very ` aimable , ' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him . """
George Knightley	""" Me!--not at all , """
George Knightley	""" I do not want to think ill of him . I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but I hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners . """
George Knightley	""" You will excuse my being so much over - powered . If I find him conversable , I shall be glad of his acquaintance ; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb , he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts . """
George Knightley	""" And mine , """
George Knightley	""" is , that if he turn out any thing like it , he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing ! What ! at three - and - twenty to be the king of his company -- the great man-- the practised politician , who is to read every body 's character , and make every body 's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority ; to be dispensing his flatteries around , that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself ! My dear Emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point . """
George Knightley	""" Prejudiced ! I am not prejudiced . """
George Knightley	""" He is a person I never think of from one month 's end to another , """
George Knightley	""" No , """
George Knightley	""" you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension . I think you understand me , therefore . """
George Knightley	""" My dear Emma , """
George Knightley	""" you are not going to tell me , I hope , that you had not a pleasant evening . """
George Knightley	""" I am disappointed , """
George Knightley	""" Emma , """
George Knightley	""" I have a piece of news for you . You like news -- and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you . """
George Knightley	""" News ! Oh ! yes , I always like news . What is it?--why do you smile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls ? """
George Knightley	""" No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls , """
George Knightley	""" Oh ! my dear sir , how are you this morning ? My dear Miss Woodhouse-- I come quite over - powered . Such a beautiful hind - quarter of pork ! You are too bountiful ! Have you heard the news ? Mr. Elton is going to be married . """
George Knightley	""" There is my news:--I thought it would interest you , """
George Knightley	""" How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment ! for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.-- You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner . """
George Knightley	""" Quite out of the question , quite out of the question , """
George Knightley	""" but you must often wish it , I am sure . """
George Knightley	""" Yes , """
George Knightley	""" But they would have done better had they given her notice of it . Surprizes are foolish things . The pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable . I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell . """
George Knightley	""" That will do , """
George Knightley	""" you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet . """
George Knightley	""" That fellow , """
George Knightley	""" thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice . This must not be . """
George Knightley	""" How d ' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well , I thank you . So obliged to you for the carriage last night . We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us . Pray come in ; do come in . You will find some friends here . """
George Knightley	""" How is your niece , Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece . How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no cold last night . How is she to - day ? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is . """
George Knightley	""" I am going to Kingston . Can I do any thing for you ? """
George Knightley	""" Oh ! dear , Kingston -- are you?--Mrs . Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston . """
George Knightley	""" Mrs. Cole has servants to send . Can I do any thing for _ you _ ? """
George Knightley	""" No , I thank you . But do come in . Who do you think is here?-- Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith ; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte . Do put up your horse at the Crown , and come in . """
George Knightley	""" Well , """
George Knightley	""" for five minutes , perhaps . """
George Knightley	""" And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful ; so many friends ! """
George Knightley	""" No , not now , I thank you . I could not stay two minutes . I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can . """
George Knightley	""" Oh ! do come in . They will be so very happy to see you . """
George Knightley	""" No , no ; your room is full enough . I will call another day , and hear the pianoforte . """
George Knightley	""" Well , I am so sorry!--Oh ! Mr. Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?-- Was not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it . """
George Knightley	""" Oh ! very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes . And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too . I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England . Now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but I can not stay to hear it . """
George Knightley	""" Oh ! Mr. Knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence-- so shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples ! """
George Knightley	""" What is the matter now ? """
George Knightley	""" To think of your sending us all your store apples . You said you had a great many , and now you have not one left . We really are so shocked ! Mrs. Hodges may well be angry . William Larkins mentioned it here . You should not have done it , indeed you should not . Ah ! he is off . He never can bear to be thanked . But I thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned . . . . Well , ( returning to the room , ) I have not been able to succeed . Mr. Knightley can not stop . He is going to Kingston . He asked me if he could do any thing . . . . """
George Knightley	""" Oh ! yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr. Knightley spoke loud . You must have heard every thing to be sure . ` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ? ' said he ; so I just mentioned . . . . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , must you be going?--You seem but just come -- so very obliging of you . """
George Knightley	""" You , Emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck ! """
George Knightley	""" You are right , Mrs. Weston , """
George Knightley	""" Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton . Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her . But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs. Elton , which nobody else pays her . """
George Knightley	""" Oh ! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand . Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago . """
George Knightley	""" That will never be , however , I can assure you . Miss Fairfax , I dare say , would not have me if I were to ask her -- and I am very sure I shall never ask her . """
George Knightley	""" So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ? """
George Knightley	""" No indeed I have not . You have scolded me too much for match - making , for me to presume to take such a liberty with you . What I said just now , meant nothing . One says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning . Oh ! no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body . You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married . """
George Knightley	""" No , Emma , I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way , I assure you . """
George Knightley	""" Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman -- but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect . She has a fault . She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife . """
George Knightley	""" Yes , very soon . He gave me a quiet hint ; I told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon and said no more . Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours . """
George Knightley	""" I hope you did not venture far , Miss Fairfax , this morning , or I am sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time . I hope you turned directly . """
George Knightley	""" Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine . """
George Knightley	""" That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before . The post - office has a great charm at one period of our lives . When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for . """
George Knightley	""" I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I can not expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters . """
George Knightley	""" Indifferent ! Oh ! no -- I never conceived you could become indifferent . Letters are no matter of indifference ; they are generally a very positive curse . """
George Knightley	""" You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship . """
George Knightley	""" Ah ! you are not serious now . I know Mr. John Knightley too well-- I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body . I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation . You have every body dearest to you always at hand , I , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections , a post - office , I think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day . """
George Knightley	""" When I talked of your being altered by time , by the progress of years , """
George Knightley	""" I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings . I consider one as including the other . Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle -- but that is not the change I had in view for you . As an old friend , you will allow me to hope , Miss Fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have . """
George Knightley	""" thank you """
George Knightley	""" The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them . If you want any farther explanation , """
George Knightley	""" they are paid for it . That is the key to a great deal of capacity . The public pays and must be served well . """
George Knightley	""" I have heard it asserted , """
George Knightley	""" that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough . But for that reason , I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get . Isabella and Emma , I think , do write very much alike . I have not always known their writing apart . """
George Knightley	""" I do not admire it , """
George Knightley	""" It is too small-- wants strength . It is like a woman 's writing . """
George Knightley	""" Oh ! when a gallant young man , like Mr. Frank Churchill , """
George Knightley	""" writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best . """
George Knightley	""" I could not have believed it even of _ him _ . """
George Knightley	""" Well , Emma , I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister 's letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure . My charge would be much more concise than her 's , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them . """
George Knightley	""" And if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again . """
George Knightley	""" I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father-- or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately . """
George Knightley	""" Certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life . """
George Knightley	""" There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be . Witness this very time . Here am I come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party!-- When did it happen before , or any thing like it ? Your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it . A little while ago , every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at Mr. Cole 's , or balls at the Crown . The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great . """
George Knightley	""" Very well -- and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way . And if they are , I only beg you to send them home . """
George Knightley	""" No , """
George Knightley	""" that need not be the consequence . Let them be sent to Donwell . I shall certainly be at leisure . """
George Knightley	""" They aimed at wounding more than Harriet , """
George Knightley	""" Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ? """
George Knightley	""" _ She _ ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be.--To that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , Emma , that you did want him to marry Harriet . """
George Knightley	""" I shall not scold you . I leave you to your own reflections . """
George Knightley	""" Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong ? """
George Knightley	""" Not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong , I am sure the other tells you of it . """
George Knightley	""" I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton . There is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which I did not : and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet . It was through a series of strange blunders ! """
George Knightley	""" And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs. Elton is totally without . An unpretending , single - minded , artless girl-- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton . I found Harriet more conversable than I expected . """
George Knightley	""" Come Miss Woodhouse , Miss Otway , Miss Fairfax , what are you all doing?-- Come Emma , set your companions the example . Every body is lazy ! Every body is asleep ! """
George Knightley	""" Whom are you going to dance with ? """
George Knightley	""" Will you ? """
George Knightley	""" Indeed I will . You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper . """
George Knightley	""" I did not know that proper names were allowed , """
George Knightley	""" Pray , Emma , """
George Knightley	""" may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ? I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other . """
George Knightley	""" The joke , """
George Knightley	""" seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill . """
George Knightley	""" My dear Emma , """
George Knightley	""" do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ? """
George Knightley	""" Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ? """
George Knightley	""" I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them-- certain expressive looks , which I did not believe meant to be public . """
George Knightley	""" You had better explore to Donwell , """
George Knightley	""" That may be done without horses . Come , and eat my strawberries . They are ripening fast . """
George Knightley	""" I can not name a day , """
George Knightley	""" till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you . """
George Knightley	""" I hope you will bring Elton , """
George Knightley	""" but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations . """
George Knightley	""" No,""--he"
George Knightley	""" These are my own concerns . I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin . ""--She"
George Knightley	""" This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else . _ Perfection _ should not have come quite so soon . """
George Knightley	""" Emma , I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but I must still use it . I can not see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance . How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates ? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character , age , and situation?-- Emma , I had not thought it possible . """
George Knightley	""" Nay , how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it . It was not so very bad . I dare say she did not understand me . """
George Knightley	""" I assure you she did . She felt your full meaning . She has talked of it since . I wish you could have heard how she talked of it-- with what candour and generosity . I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome . """
George Knightley	""" I would not go away without seeing you , but I have no time to spare , and therefore must now be gone directly . I am going to London , to spend a few days with John and Isabella . Have you any thing to send or say , besides the ` love , ' which nobody carries ? """
George Knightley	""" Nothing at all . But is not this a sudden scheme ? """
George Knightley	""" Yes -- rather -- I have been thinking of it some little time . """
George Knightley	""" I am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled . Mrs. Elton is very good - natured and agreeable , and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be . I hope it is a dry situation , and that her health will be taken good care of . It ought to be a first object , as I am sure poor Miss Taylor 's always was with me . You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us . And I hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long . """
George Knightley	""" Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith . ""--She"
George Knightley	""" He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors . ""--She"
George Knightley	""" Have I ? """
George Knightley	""" of what nature ? """
George Knightley	""" Oh ! the best nature in the world -- a wedding . """
George Knightley	""" If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already . """
George Knightley	""" I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened . """
George Knightley	""" Time , my dearest Emma , time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent sense -- your exertions for your father 's sake -- I know you will not allow yourself-- . """
George Knightley	""" The feelings of the warmest friendship -- Indignation -- Abominable scoundrel!""--"
George Knightley	""" He will soon be gone . They will soon be in Yorkshire . I am sorry for _ her _ . She deserves a better fate . """
George Knightley	""" You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right.-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion . My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier . """
George Knightley	""" Emma ! """
George Knightley	""" are you , indeed?""--"
George Knightley	"himself--""No , no , I understand you -- forgive me -- I am pleased that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret , indeed ! and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!--I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt-- I could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?-- Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature . """
George Knightley	""" He is a most fortunate man ! """
George Knightley	""" So early in life -- at three - and - twenty -- a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill . At three - and - twenty to have drawn such a prize ! What years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him!--Assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for Jane Fairfax 's character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour,-- equality of situation -- I mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one-- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _ her _ regard , must , I think , be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune . Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets with a young woman at a watering - place , gains her affection , can not even weary her by negligent treatment -- and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him , they could not have found her superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has only to speak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.-- He had used every body ill -- and they are all delighted to forgive him.-- He is a fortunate man indeed ! """
George Knightley	""" And I do envy him , Emma . In one respect he is the object of my envy . """
George Knightley	""" You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity.--You are wise -- but _ I _ can not be wise . Emma , I must tell you what you will not ask , though I may wish it unsaid the next moment . """
George Knightley	""" Thank you , """
George Knightley	""" You are going in , I suppose ? """
George Knightley	""" I shall be very glad to look it over , """
George Knightley	""" but it seems long . I will take it home with me at night . """
George Knightley	""" I would rather be talking to you , """
George Knightley	""" but as it seems a matter of justice , it shall be done . """
George Knightley	""" Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman 's letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference . """
George Knightley	""" Humph ! a fine complimentary opening : But it is his way . One man 's style must not be the rule of another 's . We will not be severe . """
George Knightley	""" It will be natural for me , """
George Knightley	""" to speak my opinion aloud as I read . By doing it , I shall feel that I am near you . It will not be so great a loss of time : but if you dislike it-- """
George Knightley	""" Not at all . I should wish it . """
George Knightley	""" He trifles here , """
George Knightley	""" as to the temptation . He knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to have formed the engagement.--`His father 's disposition:'-- he is unjust , however , to his father . Mr. Weston 's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions ; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.--Very true ; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here . """
George Knightley	""" I hope he does , """
George Knightley	""" ` Smallridge!'--What does this mean ? What is all this ? """
George Knightley	""" Say nothing , my dear Emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of Mrs. Elton . Only one page more . I shall soon have done . What a letter the man writes ! """
George Knightley	""" Well , there _ is _ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill.--Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her . ` Dearer , much dearer than ever . ' I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker , with his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve . ' Come , he knows himself there . ` Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune . '--Those were Miss Woodhouse 's words , were they?-- And a fine ending -- and there is the letter . The child of good fortune ! That was your name for him , was it ? """
George Knightley	""" Yes , certainly it does . He has had great faults , faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness ; and I am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves : but still as he is , beyond a doubt , really attached to Miss Fairfax , and will soon , it may be hoped , have the advantage of being constantly with her , I am very ready to believe his character will improve , and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants . And now , let me talk to you of something else . I have another person 's interest at present so much at heart , that I can not think any longer about Frank Churchill . Ever since I left you this morning , Emma , my mind has been hard at work on one subject . """
George Knightley	""" That is , """
George Knightley	""" she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all . It will be the only difference . """
George Knightley	""" Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands . She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older . I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma . I , who am owing all my happiness to _ you _ , would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them ? """
George Knightley	""" Do you?--I have no doubt . Nature gave you understanding:-- Miss Taylor gave you principles . You must have done well . My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good . It was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me?-- and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner . I do not believe I did you any good . The good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me . I could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least . """
George Knightley	""" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks--`Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor 's leave'--something which , you knew , I did not approve . In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one . """
George Knightley	""" ` Mr. Knightley . '--You always called me , ` Mr. Knightley ; ' and , from habit , it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal . I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what . """
George Knightley	""" And can not you call me ` George ' now ? """
George Knightley	""" John does not even mention your friend , """
George Knightley	""" Here is his answer , if you like to see it . """
George Knightley	""" John enters like a brother into my happiness , """
George Knightley	""" but he is no complimenter ; and though I well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise . But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes . """
George Knightley	""" My Emma , he means no such thing . He only means-- """
George Knightley	""" Emma , my dear Emma-- """
George Knightley	""" I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news . """
George Knightley	""" I do not know which it ought to be called . """
George Knightley	""" Oh ! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance . You are trying not to smile . """
George Knightley	""" I am afraid , """
George Knightley	""" I am very much afraid , my dear Emma , that you will not smile when you hear it . """
George Knightley	""" Indeed ! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too . """
George Knightley	""" There is one subject , """
George Knightley	""" I hope but one , on which we do not think alike . """
George Knightley	""" Does nothing occur to you?-- Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith . """
George Knightley	""" Have you heard from her yourself this morning ? """
George Knightley	""" You have , I believe , and know the whole . """
George Knightley	""" You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is . Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin . """
George Knightley	""" It is so , indeed , """
George Knightley	""" I have it from Robert Martin himself . He left me not half an hour ago . """
George Knightley	""" I mean that he has done it , """
George Knightley	""" and been accepted . """
George Knightley	"cried.--""Well!""--Then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , """
George Knightley	""" You ought to know your friend best , """
George Knightley	""" but I should say she was a good - tempered , soft - hearted girl , not likely to be very , very determined against any young man who told her he loved her . """
George Knightley	""" Do you dare say this ? """
George Knightley	""" Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of?-- What do you deserve ? """
George Knightley	""" I am quite sure , """
George Knightley	""" that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so . He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do . He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends . Could I mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to Mrs. Goddard ? I assured him that I could not . Then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day . """
Harriet Smith	""" Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd ! It was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by Randalls . He did not think we ever walked this road . He thought we walked towards Randalls most days . He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet . He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow . So very odd we should happen to meet ! Well , Miss Woodhouse , is he like what you expected ? What do you think of him ? Do you think him so very plain ? """
Harriet Smith	""" To be sure , """
Harriet Smith	""" he is not so genteel as real gentlemen . """
Harriet Smith	""" Certainly , he is not like Mr. Knightley . He has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley . I see the difference plain enough . But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man ! """
Harriet Smith	""" Oh yes!--there is a great difference . But Mr. Weston is almost an old man . Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty . """
Harriet Smith	""" There is no saying , indeed , """
Harriet Smith	""" In one respect , perhaps , Mr. Elton 's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley 's or Mr. Weston 's . They have more gentleness . They might be more safely held up as a pattern . There is an openness , a quickness , almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston , which every body likes in _ him _ , because there is so much good - humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied . Neither would Mr. Knightley 's downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _ him _ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable . On the contrary , I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model . Mr. Elton is good - humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle . He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late . I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , Harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be . If he means any thing , it must be to please you . Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day ? """
Harriet Smith	""" Oh ! dear , no , never . """
Harriet Smith	""" If he would be so good as to read to them , it would be a kindness indeed ! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith 's . """
Harriet Smith	""" Will you read the letter ? """
Harriet Smith	""" Pray do . I 'd rather you would . """
Harriet Smith	""" You think I ought to refuse him then , """
Harriet Smith	""" I had no notion that he liked me so very much , """
Harriet Smith	""" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr. Martin . Do you think I am right ? """
Harriet Smith	""" Perfectly , perfectly right , my dearest Harriet ; you are doing just what you ought . While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving . Dear Harriet , I give myself joy of this . It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin . While you were in the smallest degree wavering , I said nothing about it , because I would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me . I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin , of Abbey - Mill Farm . Now I am secure of you for ever . """
Harriet Smith	""" You could not have visited me ! """
Harriet Smith	""" No , to be sure you could not ; but I never thought of that before . That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world . """
Harriet Smith	""" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been . You would have thrown yourself out of all good society . I must have given you up . """
Harriet Smith	""" Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it ! It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more ! """
Harriet Smith	""" Dear affectionate creature!--_You _ banished to Abbey - Mill Farm!--_You _ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life ! I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it . He must have a pretty good opinion of himself . """
Harriet Smith	""" I do not think he is conceited either , in general , """
Harriet Smith	""" at least , he is very good natured , and I shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that I should -- and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _ one _ is so very handsome and agreeable . However , I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but as to leaving you , it is what I would not do upon any consideration . """
Harriet Smith	""" Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too . """
Harriet Smith	""" I shall never be invited to Abbey - Mill again , """
Harriet Smith	""" Nor , if you were , could I ever bear to part with you , my Harriet . You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey - Mill . """
Harriet Smith	""" And I am sure I should never want to go there ; for I am never happy but at Hartfield . """
Harriet Smith	""" I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened . I am sure Miss Nash would -- for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen - draper . """
Harriet Smith	""" One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , Harriet . I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married . Even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes . As to any thing superior for you , I suppose she is quite in the dark . The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle - tattle of Highbury yet . Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves . """
Harriet Smith	""" Now he has got my letter , """
Harriet Smith	""" I wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too . I hope he will not mind it so very much . """
Harriet Smith	""" My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond - street . """
Harriet Smith	""" Very well , Mr. Elton , very well indeed . I have read worse charades . _ Courtship_--a very good hint . I give you credit for it . This is feeling your way . This is saying very plainly--`Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you . Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance . '"
Harriet Smith	""" What can it be , Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be ? I have not an idea -- I can not guess it in the least . What can it possibly be ? Do try to find it out , Miss Woodhouse . Do help me . I never saw any thing so hard . Is it kingdom ? I wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady . Do you think it is a good one ? Can it be woman ?"
Harriet Smith	""" Mermaids and sharks ! Nonsense ! My dear Harriet , what are you thinking of ? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark ? Give me the paper and listen ."
Harriet Smith	""""
Harriet Smith	""" Whatever you say is always right , """
Harriet Smith	""" and therefore I suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise I could not have imagined it . It is so much beyond any thing I deserve . Mr. Elton , who might marry any body ! There can not be two opinions about _ him _ . He is so very superior . Only think of those sweet verses--`To Miss -------- . ' Dear me , how clever!--Could it really be meant for me ? """
Harriet Smith	""" It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected . I am sure , a month ago , I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do take place ! """
Harriet Smith	""" That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me , of all people , who did not know him , to speak to him , at Michaelmas ! And he , the very handsomest man that ever was , and a man that every body looks up to , quite like Mr. Knightley ! His company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week . And so excellent in the Church ! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury . Dear me ! When I look back to the first time I saw him ! How little did I think!--The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good - natured . And how beautiful we thought he looked ! He was arm - in - arm with Mr. Cole . """
Harriet Smith	""" Yes , very true . How nicely you talk ; I love to hear you . You understand every thing . You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other . This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth , I could never have made any thing like it . """
Harriet Smith	""" I do think it is , without exception , the best charade I ever read . """
Harriet Smith	""" It is as long again as almost all we have had before . """
Harriet Smith	""" It is one thing , """
Harriet Smith	"glow--""to have very good sense in a common way , like every body else , and if there is any thing to say , to sit down and write a letter , and say just what you must , in a short way ; and another , to write verses and charades like this . """
Harriet Smith	""" Such sweet lines ! """
Harriet Smith	""" Leave it to me . You do nothing . He will be here this evening , I dare say , and then I will give it him back , and some nonsense or other will pass between us , and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming . Trust to me . """
Harriet Smith	""" Leave out the two last lines , and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book . """
Harriet Smith	"--""The best of all . Granted;--for private enjoyment ; and for private enjoyment keep them . They are not at all the less written you know , because you divide them . The couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change . But take it away , and all _ appropriation _ ceases , and a very pretty gallant charade remains , fit for any collection . Depend upon it , he would not like to have his charade slighted , much better than his passion . A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities , or neither . Give me the book , I will write it down , and then there can be no possible reflection on you . """
Harriet Smith	""" I shall never let that book go out of my own hands , """
Harriet Smith	""" My dear Harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade.--You will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it . Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration . If he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while I was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you . Do not let us be too solemn on the business . He has encouragement enough to proceed , without our sighing out our souls over this charade . """
Harriet Smith	""" Oh ! no -- I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it . Do as you please . """
Harriet Smith	""" Well , my dears , how does your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh ? """
Harriet Smith	""" There it is . There go you and your riddle - book one of these days . ""--"
Harriet Smith	""" Oh , what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much . """
Harriet Smith	""" I wish we could contrive it , """
Harriet Smith	""" but I can not think of any tolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father . """
Harriet Smith	""" I do so wonder , Miss Woodhouse , that you should not be married , or going to be married ! so charming as you are!""--"
Harriet Smith	""" Ah!--so you say ; but I can not believe it . """
Harriet Smith	""" Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!""--"
Harriet Smith	""" But then , to be an old maid at last , like Miss Bates ! """
Harriet Smith	""" But still , you will be an old maid ! and that 's so dreadful ! """
Harriet Smith	""" Dear me ! but what shall you do ? how shall you employ yourself when you grow old ? """
Harriet Smith	""" Do you know Miss Bates 's niece ? That is , I know you must have seen her a hundred times -- but are you acquainted ? """
Harriet Smith	""" Very true , """
Harriet Smith	""" Poor creatures ! one can think of nothing else . """
Harriet Smith	""" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened ! """
Harriet Smith	""" very true , """
Harriet Smith	""" would not think about it ; """
Harriet Smith	""" of course it must be declined , """
Harriet Smith	""" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company . """
Harriet Smith	""" Oh ! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax ! """
Harriet Smith	""" Oh ! dear -- I think you play the best of the two . I think you play quite as well as she does . I am sure I had much rather hear you . Every body last night said how well you played . """
Harriet Smith	""" Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out . Mr. Cole said how much taste you had ; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution . """
Harriet Smith	""" Are you sure ? I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste . Nobody talked about it . And I hate Italian singing.-- There is no understanding a word of it . Besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach . The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family . How did you think the Coxes looked ? """
Harriet Smith	""" They told me something , """
Harriet Smith	""" but it is nothing of any consequence . """
Harriet Smith	""" Aye , that will be much best , """
Harriet Smith	""" I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard 's . """
Harriet Smith	""" I must not dwell upon it , """
Harriet Smith	"she.--""I must not think of it . I know the danger of indulging such speculations . But stranger things have happened ; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now , it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure . """
Harriet Smith	""" it was very true-- it was just as Miss Woodhouse described -- it was not worth while to think about them -- and she would not think about them any longer """
Harriet Smith	""" Well , Miss Woodhouse , """
Harriet Smith	""" Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh , ) what do you think of her?-- Is not she very charming ? """
Harriet Smith	""" Oh ! yes -- very -- a very pleasing young woman . """
Harriet Smith	""" I think her beautiful , quite beautiful . """
Harriet Smith	""" Very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown . """
Harriet Smith	""" I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love . """
Harriet Smith	""" Oh ! no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune ; and she came in his way . """
Harriet Smith	""" I dare say , """
Harriet Smith	""" I dare say she was very much attached to him . """
Harriet Smith	""" Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man 's fate to marry the woman who loves him best . Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have . """
Harriet Smith	""" Yes , """
Harriet Smith	""" and well she might , nobody could ever have a better . Well , I wish them happy with all my heart . And now , Miss Woodhouse , I do not think I shall mind seeing them again . He is just as superior as ever;--but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing . No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery . To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort!-- She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves . Happy creature ! He called her ` Augusta . ' How delightful ! """
Harriet Smith	""" Miss Woodhouse -- if you are at leisure -- I have something that I should like to tell you -- a sort of confession to make -- and then , you know , it will be over . """
Harriet Smith	""" It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish , """
Harriet Smith	""" to have no reserves with you on this subject . As I am happily quite an altered creature in _ one _ _ respect _ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it . I do not want to say more than is necessary -- I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me . """
Harriet Smith	""" How I could so long a time be fancying myself ! . . . """
Harriet Smith	""" Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing ? """
Harriet Smith	""" Now , """
Harriet Smith	""" you _ must _ recollect . """
Harriet Smith	""" No , indeed I do not . """
Harriet Smith	""" Dear me ! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat -- just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came-- I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister?-- But , as you had none about you , and knew I had , you desired me to supply him ; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me . And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it-- so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat . """
Harriet Smith	""" And had you really some at hand yourself ? I am sure I never suspected it , you did it so naturally . """
Harriet Smith	""" Here , """
Harriet Smith	""" here is something still more valuable , I mean that _ has _ _ been _ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did . """
Harriet Smith	""" I shall be happier to burn it , """
Harriet Smith	""" It has a disagreeable look to me . I must get rid of every thing.-- There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven ! of Mr. Elton . """
Harriet Smith	""" I shall never marry . """
Harriet Smith	""" Mr. Elton indeed ! """
Harriet Smith	"her.--""But , with common sense , """
Harriet Smith	""" I am afraid I have had little to do . """
Harriet Smith	""" Well , Miss Woodhouse ! """
Harriet Smith	""" is not this the oddest news that ever was ? """
Harriet Smith	""" About Jane Fairfax . Did you ever hear any thing so strange ? Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for Mr. Weston has told me himself . I met him just now . He told me it was to be a great secret ; and , therefore , I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you , but he said you knew it . """
Harriet Smith	""" Had you any idea , """
Harriet Smith	""" of his being in love with her?--You , perhaps , might.--You ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body 's heart ; but nobody else-- """
Harriet Smith	""" Me ! """
Harriet Smith	""" Why should you caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill . """
Harriet Smith	""" Him!--never , never . Dear Miss Woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ? """
Harriet Smith	""" I should not have thought it possible , """
Harriet Smith	""" that you could have misunderstood me ! I know we agreed never to name him-- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else , I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person . Mr. Frank Churchill , indeed ! I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other . I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill , who is like nobody by his side . And that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing!--I am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him . At first , if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened ; that there had been matches of greater disparity ( those were your very words);-- I should not have dared to give way to -- I should not have thought it possible -- But if _ you _ , who had been always acquainted with him-- """
Harriet Smith	"resolutely--""Let us understand each other now , without the possibility of farther mistake . Are you speaking of -- Mr. Knightley ? """
Harriet Smith	""" To be sure I am . I never could have an idea of any body else-- and so I thought you knew . When we talked about him , it was as clear as possible . """
Harriet Smith	""" Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , how you do forget ! """
Harriet Smith	""" Oh , dear , """
Harriet Smith	""" now I recollect what you mean ; but I was thinking of something very different at the time . It was not the gipsies -- it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant . No ! ( with some elevation ) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance-- of Mr. Knightley 's coming and asking me to dance , when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me ; and when there was no other partner in the room . That was the kind action ; that was the noble benevolence and generosity ; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth . """
Harriet Smith	""" Yes , """
Harriet Smith	"fearfully--""I must say that I have . """
Harriet Smith	""" Might he not?--Is not it possible , that when enquiring , as you thought , into the state of your affections , he might be alluding to Mr. Martin-- he might have Mr. Martin 's interest in view ? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit ."
Harriet Smith	""" Mr. Martin ! No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin . I hope I know better now , than to care for Mr. Martin , or to be suspected of it . """
Harriet Smith	""" I never should have presumed to think of it at first , """
Harriet Smith	""" but for you . You told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine -- and so I have . But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful . """
Harriet Smith	""" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . """
Harriet Smith	""" She could not compose herself-- Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go;""--with"
Jane Fairfax	""" She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome ! """
Jane Fairfax	""" When I have seen Mr. Elton , """
Jane Fairfax	""" I dare say I shall be interested -- but I believe it requires _ that _ with me . And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Yes , """
Jane Fairfax	""" we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing . """
Jane Fairfax	""""
Jane Fairfax	""" and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax 's situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Oh ! but dear Miss Woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end ! And I think she feels it . I am sure she does . She is very timid and silent . One can see that she feels the want of encouragement . I like her the better for it . I must confess it is a recommendation to me . I am a great advocate for timidity -- and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing . Oh ! I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express . """
Jane Fairfax	""" You appear to feel a great deal -- but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax 's acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than""--"
Jane Fairfax	""" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act . You and I need not be afraid . If _ we _ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations . _ We _ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _ we _ live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _ more _ than Jane Fairfax to partake of it . I have no idea of that sort of thing . It is not likely that I _ should _ , considering what I have been used to . My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense . Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be-- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr. Suckling , in income.--However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation . My acquaintance is so very extensive , that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her , of course , very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us . I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Poor Jane Fairfax!""--thought"
Jane Fairfax	"Emma.--""You have not deserved this . You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax . ' Heavens ! Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me!-- But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman 's tongue ! """
Jane Fairfax	""" dear Miss Woodhouse . """
Jane Fairfax	""" I went only to the post - office , """
Jane Fairfax	""" and reached home before the rain was much . It is my daily errand . I always fetch the letters when I am here . It saves trouble , and is a something to get me out . A walk before breakfast does me good . """
Jane Fairfax	""" No , but it did not absolutely rain when I set out . """
Jane Fairfax	""" You are extremely kind , """
Jane Fairfax	""" but I can not give up my early walk . I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can , I must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Excuse me , """
Jane Fairfax	""" I can not by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant . If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama 's . """
Jane Fairfax	""" The post - office is a wonderful establishment ! """
Jane Fairfax	""" The regularity and despatch of it ! If one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing ! """
Jane Fairfax	""" It is certainly very well regulated . """
Jane Fairfax	""" So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears ! So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost ! And when one considers the variety of hands , and of bad hands too , that are to be deciphered , it increases the wonder . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Here is April come ! """
Jane Fairfax	""" I get quite anxious about you . June will soon be here . """
Jane Fairfax	""" But have you really heard of nothing ? """
Jane Fairfax	""" Oh ! my dear , we can not begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing . """
Jane Fairfax	""" I not aware ! """
Jane Fairfax	""" dear Mrs. Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ? """
Jane Fairfax	""" But you have not seen so much of the world as I have . You do not know how many candidates there always are for the _ first _ situations . I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove . A cousin of Mr. Suckling , Mrs. Bragge , had such an infinity of applications ; every body was anxious to be in her family , for she moves in the first circle . Wax - candles in the schoolroom ! You may imagine how desirable ! Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge 's is the one I would most wish to see you in . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer , """
Jane Fairfax	""" I must spend some time with them ; I am sure they will want it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself . But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Trouble ! aye , I know your scruples . You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am . I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Thank you , but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , I do not wish to be giving any body trouble . """
Jane Fairfax	""" But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us . Your inexperience really amuses me ! A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment 's notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Excuse me , ma'am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends . When I am quite determined as to the time , I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed . There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- Offices for the sale-- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Oh ! my dear , human flesh ! You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition . """
Jane Fairfax	""" I did not mean , I was not thinking of the slave - trade , """
Jane Fairfax	""" governess - trade , I assure you , was all that I had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , I do not know where it lies . But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices , and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do . """
Jane Fairfax	""" You are very obliging ; but as to all that , I am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , I think , would only be the greater ; I should suffer more from comparison . A gentleman 's family is all that I should condition for . """
Jane Fairfax	""" You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together , """
Jane Fairfax	""" they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs. Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer . For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am , and as I am . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Such things do occur , undoubtedly . ""--She"
Jane Fairfax	""" I was only going to observe , that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women , I can not imagine them to be very frequent . A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise-- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards . I would be understood to mean , that it can be only weak , irresolute characters , ( whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance , ) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience , an oppression for ever . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Now , ma'am , """
Jane Fairfax	""" shall we join Mrs. Elton ? """
Jane Fairfax	""" It must be a severe trial to them all . She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell 's return . """
Jane Fairfax	""" always ; """
Jane Fairfax	""" Where -- may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going ? """
Jane Fairfax	""" To a Mrs. Smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children . Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , Mrs. Suckling 's own family , and Mrs. Bragge 's ; but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove . Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Mrs. Elton , I suppose , has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes-- """
Jane Fairfax	""" Yes , our good Mrs. Elton . The most indefatigable , true friend . She would not take a denial . She would not let Jane say , ` No ; ' for when Jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at Donwell , ) when Jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell 's return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over again -- and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than I did . It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take Jane 's answer ; but she positively declared she would _ not _ write any such denial yesterday , as Jane wished her ; she would wait -- and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go . Quite a surprize to me ! I had not the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside , and told her at once , that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge 's situation , she had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it till it was all settled . """
Jane Fairfax	""" You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton ? """
Jane Fairfax	""" Yes , all of us ; Mrs. Elton would have us come . It was settled so , upon the hill , while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley . ` You _ must _ _ all _ spend your evening with us , ' said she--`I positively must have you _ all _ come . ' """
Jane Fairfax	""" Mr. Knightley was there too , was he ? """
Jane Fairfax	""" No , not Mr. Knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though I thought he would come , because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him off , he did not;--but my mother , and Jane , and I , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had . Such kind friends , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one must always find agreeable , though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning 's party . Even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and I can not say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it . However , _ I _ shall always think it a very pleasant party , and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Miss Fairfax , I suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ? """
Jane Fairfax	""" I dare say she had . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Whenever the time may come , it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends -- but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible -- I mean , as to the character and manners of the family . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse . Yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it . Except the Sucklings and Bragges , there is not such another nursery establishment , so liberal and elegant , in all Mrs. Elton 's acquaintance . Mrs. Smallridge , a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove -- and as to the children , except the little Sucklings and little Bragges , there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere . Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!-- It will be nothing but pleasure , a life of pleasure.--And her salary!-- I really can not venture to name her salary to you , Miss Woodhouse . Even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane . """
Jane Fairfax	""" You are so noble in your ideas ! """
Jane Fairfax	""" Very soon , very soon , indeed ; that 's the worst of it . Within a fortnight . Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry . My poor mother does not know how to bear it . So then , I try to put it out of her thoughts , and say , Come ma'am , do not let us think about it any more . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Yes ; Jane says she is sure they will ; but yet , this is such a situation as she can not feel herself justified in declining . I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton , and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it ! It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh ! no , now I recollect , now I have it ; something happened before tea , but not that . Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea , old John Abdy 's son wanted to speak with him . Poor old John , I have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty - seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed - ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints-- I must go and see him to - day ; and so will Jane , I am sure , if she gets out at all . And poor John 's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he can not keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr. Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond . That was what happened before tea . It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Oh ! """
Jane Fairfax	"composure--""there would have been no danger . The danger would have been of my wearying you . You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest-- . Indeed , Miss Woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly , ) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to -- I have not time for half that I could wish to say . I long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself . I feel it so very due . But , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend-- """
Jane Fairfax	""" You are very kind , but I know what my manners were to you.-- So cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life of deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Very . """
Jane Fairfax	""" Oh ! as to all that , of course nothing can be thought of yet . I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell . """
Jane Fairfax	""" You are very right ; it has been thought of . And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ) , that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled . There must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for . """
Jane Fairfax	""" How you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me!-- They _ will _ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them ! """
Frank Churchill	""" Was he handsome?""--""She"
Frank Churchill	""" """
Frank Churchill	"agreeable?""-- """
Frank Churchill	""" """
Frank Churchill	"information?""--""At a watering - place , or in a common London acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points . Manners were all that could be safely judged of , under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill . She believed every body found his manners pleasing . """
Frank Churchill	""" A very pleasant evening , """
Frank Churchill	"away;--""particularly pleasant . You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music . I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one 's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma . You left nothing undone . I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother 's , it must have been a real indulgence . """
Frank Churchill	""" Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ? """
Frank Churchill	""" I have made a most wretched discovery , """
Frank Churchill	""" I have been here a week to - morrow -- half my time . I never knew days fly so fast . A week to - morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself . But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston , and others!-- I hate the recollection . """
Frank Churchill	""" Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut . """
Frank Churchill	""" No , """
Frank Churchill	""" that is no subject of regret at all . I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen . """
Frank Churchill	""" Thank you for rousing me , """
Frank Churchill	""" I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that I can not keep my eyes from her . I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her own . I see nobody else looking like her!-- I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion . Shall I?-- Yes , I will -- I declare I will -- and you shall see how she takes it;-- whether she colours . """
Frank Churchill	""" One more;--they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account , and would only ask for one more . """
Frank Churchill	""" I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling . The strength of the song falls on the second . """
Frank Churchill	""" Perhaps it is as well , """
Frank Churchill	""" I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your 's . """
Frank Churchill	""" And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope , """
Frank Churchill	""" to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield-- if you are going home . """
Frank Churchill	""" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ , """
Frank Churchill	""" the person has not chosen ill . I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell 's taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _ all _ _ that _ _ party _ would particularly prize . I dare say , Miss Fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to Broadwood himself . Do not you think so ? """
Frank Churchill	""" We were too magnificent , """
Frank Churchill	""" We allowed unnecessary room . Ten couple may stand here very well . """
Frank Churchill	""" Very true , """
Frank Churchill	""" it was very bad . """
Frank Churchill	""" I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple . """
Frank Churchill	""" There is no denying it , """
Frank Churchill	""" I agree with you exactly . A crowd in a little room -- Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words . Exquisite , quite exquisite!--Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up . It would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- I do not know that -- I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well . """
Frank Churchill	""" Well , Miss Woodhouse , """
Frank Churchill	""" your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope , by the terrors of my father 's little rooms . I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a thought of my father 's , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon . May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ? """
Frank Churchill	""" Yes ; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you can not , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls . It is his own idea . Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied . This is what we all feel . Oh ! you were perfectly right ! Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _ any _ _ thing _ to like to yield . Is not it a good exchange?--You consent-- I hope you consent ? """
Frank Churchill	""" No ; he thought it very far from an improvement -- a very bad plan-- much worse than the other . A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited . If they must dance , they had better dance at Randalls . He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh ! no -- a very bad plan . They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere . """
Frank Churchill	""" I was going to observe , sir , """
Frank Churchill	""" that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body 's catching cold-- so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls ! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could . """
Frank Churchill	""" From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir . We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief . """
Frank Churchill	""" Ah ! sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected . I have often known it done myself . """
Frank Churchill	""" But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited-- """
Frank Churchill	""" So they will , my dear . That is a great thing . Not that James ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can . If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired -- but is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted ? I doubt it . I do not know her , even by sight . """
Frank Churchill	""" There , papa!--Now you must be satisfied -- Our own dear Mrs. Weston , who is carefulness itself . Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ? ` If _ Miss _ _ Taylor _ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir . ' How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her ! """
Frank Churchill	""" My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment , """
Frank Churchill	""" examining the capabilities of the house . I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . I was desired to say so from both . It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there . They can do nothing satisfactorily without you . """
Frank Churchill	""" Yes , very true , """
Frank Churchill	""" very true . You want your neighbours ' opinions . I do not wonder at you . If one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the Coles , for instance . They are not far off . Shall I call upon them ? Or Miss Bates ? She is still nearer.-- And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body . I think we do want a larger council . Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us ? """
Frank Churchill	""" I think she must be here soon , """
Frank Churchill	""" I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton , I have heard so much of her . It can not be long , I think , before she comes . """
Frank Churchill	""" I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her . I have never seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton . I have no business to put myself forward . """
Frank Churchill	""" I will see that there are umbrellas , sir , """
Frank Churchill	""" Miss Bates must not be forgotten : """
Frank Churchill	""" By the bye , """
Frank Churchill	""" Nay , I had it from you . You wrote me word of it three months ago . """
Frank Churchill	""" Indeed you did . I remember it perfectly . You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon . Mrs. Perry had told somebody , and was extremely happy about it . It was owing to _ her _ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm . You must remember it now ? """
Frank Churchill	""" Never ! really , never!--Bless me ! how could it be?--Then I must have dreamt it -- but I was completely persuaded -- Miss Smith , you walk as if you were tired . You will not be sorry to find yourself at home . """
Frank Churchill	""" Miss Woodhouse , """
Frank Churchill	""" have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ? It used to stand here . Where is it ? This is a sort of dull - looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer . We had great amusement with those letters one morning . I want to puzzle you again . """
Frank Churchill	""" I will give it to her -- shall I?""--and"
Frank Churchill	""" As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again . I could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming ! You will all be going soon I suppose ; the whole party breaking up . I met _ one _ as I came -- Madness in such weather!--absolute madness ! """
Frank Churchill	""" As soon as my aunt gets well , I shall go abroad , """
Frank Churchill	""" I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places . You will have my sketches , some time or other , to look at -- or my tour to read -- or my poem . I shall do something to expose myself . """
Frank Churchill	""" That may be -- but not by sketches in Swisserland . You will never go to Swisserland . Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England . """
Frank Churchill	""" They may be induced to go too . A warm climate may be prescribed for her . I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad . I assure you I have . I feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that I shall soon be abroad . I ought to travel . I am tired of doing nothing . I want a change . I am serious , Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy -- I am sick of England-- and would leave it to - morrow , if I could . """
Frank Churchill	""" You are sick of prosperity and indulgence . Can not you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ? """
Frank Churchill	""" _ I _ sick of prosperity and indulgence ! You are quite mistaken . I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged . I am thwarted in every thing material . I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person . """
Frank Churchill	""" You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came . Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well . Another slice of cold meat , another draught of Madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us . """
Frank Churchill	""" No -- I shall not stir . I shall sit by you . You are my best cure . """
Frank Churchill	""" We are going to Box Hill to - morrow;--you will join us . It is not Swisserland , but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change . You will stay , and go with us ? """
Frank Churchill	""" No , certainly not ; I shall go home in the cool of the evening . """
Frank Churchill	""" But you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning . """
Frank Churchill	""" No -- It will not be worth while . If I come , I shall be cross . """
Frank Churchill	""" Then pray stay at Richmond . """
Frank Churchill	""" But if I do , I shall be crosser still . I can never bear to think of you all there without me . """
Frank Churchill	""" These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself . Chuse your own degree of crossness . I shall press you no more . """
Frank Churchill	""" Well;--if _ you _ wish me to stay and join the party , I will . """
Frank Churchill	""" How much I am obliged to you , """
Frank Churchill	""" for telling me to come to - day!-- If it had not been for you , I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party . I had quite determined to go away again . """
Frank Churchill	""" Do n't say I was cross . I was fatigued . The heat overcame me . """
Frank Churchill	""" Not to my feelings . I am perfectly comfortable to - day . """
Frank Churchill	""" Your command?--Yes . """
Frank Churchill	""" It comes to the same thing . I can have no self - command without a motive . You order me , whether you speak or not . And you can be always with me . You are always with me . """
Frank Churchill	""" Three o'clock yesterday ! That is your date . I thought I had seen you first in February . """
Frank Churchill	""" It will not do , """
Frank Churchill	""" they are most of them affronted . I will attack them with more address . Ladies and gentlemen -- I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way . Here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already , ) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated -- or two things moderately clever-- or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all . """
Frank Churchill	""" Ah ! ma'am , but there may be a difficulty . Pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once . """
Frank Churchill	""" Ah!--well -- to be sure . Yes , I see what she means , ( turning to Mr. Knightley , ) and I will try to hold my tongue . I must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend . """
Frank Churchill	"son;--""but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way . """
Frank Churchill	""" Happy couple ! """
Frank Churchill	""" You were speaking , """
Frank Churchill	""" Well , I have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever I marry , I hope some body will chuse my wife for me . Will you ? ( turning to Emma . ) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you . You provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father ) . Find some body for me . I am in no hurry . Adopt her , educate her . """
Frank Churchill	""" And make her like myself . """
Frank Churchill	""" By all means , if you can . """
Frank Churchill	""" Very well . I undertake the commission . You shall have a charming wife . """
Frank Churchill	""" She must be very lively , and have hazle eyes . I care for nothing else . I shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when I return , I shall come to you for my wife . Remember . """
Frank Churchill	""" I perfectly agree with you , sir,""--was"
Frank Churchill	""" You did behave very shamefully . You never wrote a truer line . """
Frank Churchill	""" This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could . He should have respected even unreasonable scruples , had there been such ; but hers were all reasonable . We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment . """
Frank Churchill	""" There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends , the Eltons , """
Frank Churchill	"observation.--""His feelings are natural.-- What ! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each-- she dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well , he must be a most extraordinary-- """
Frank Churchill	""" Nay , nay , read on.--You will find how very much he suffers . """
Frank Churchill	""" She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge 's children-- a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's -- a neighbour of Maple Grove ; and , by the bye , I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment ? """
Frank Churchill	""" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him . """
Frank Churchill	""" You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am ; but still you must , at least I hope you must , think the better of him for it . I hope it does him some service with you . """
Frank Churchill	""" I have to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs. Weston 's letters . I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon . I hope you do not retract what you then said . """
Frank Churchill	""" Perry ! """
Frank Churchill	""" My friend Mr. Perry ! What are they saying about Mr. Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel now?--Has he set up his carriage ? """
Frank Churchill	""" Such an extraordinary dream of mine ! """
Frank Churchill	""" I can never think of it without laughing.--She hears us , she hears us , Miss Woodhouse . I see it in her cheek , her smile , her vain attempt to frown . Look at her . Do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye-- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ? """
Philip Elton	""" You have given Miss Smith all that she required , """
Philip Elton	""" you have made her graceful and easy . She was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature . """
Philip Elton	""" I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints . She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself . I have done very little . """
Philip Elton	""" I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before . """
Philip Elton	""" Exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me . So much superadded decision of character ! Skilful has been the hand ! """
Philip Elton	""" Great has been the pleasure , I am sure . I never met with a disposition more truly amiable . """
Philip Elton	""" I have no doubt of it . """
Philip Elton	""" Let me entreat you , """
Philip Elton	""" it would indeed be a delight ! Let me entreat you , Miss Woodhouse , to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend . I know what your drawings are . How could you suppose me ignorant ? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room , at Randalls ? """
Philip Elton	""" Exactly so -- The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- I have not a doubt of your success . Pray , pray attempt it . As you will do it , it will indeed , to use your own words , be an exquisite possession . """
Philip Elton	""" Oh ! yes , I observed it , I assure you . It was not lost on me . But still I can not imagine she would not be persuaded . """
Philip Elton	""" No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe . Exactly so . No husbands and wives , """
Philip Elton	""" By all means . We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party . """
Philip Elton	""" Do you think so ? """
Philip Elton	""" I can not agree with you . It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature . I never saw such a likeness in my life . We must allow for the effect of shade , you know . """
Philip Elton	""" Oh no ! certainly not too tall ; not in the least too tall . Consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know . Proportions , fore - shortening.--Oh no ! it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith 's . Exactly so indeed ! """
Philip Elton	""" But , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer . Look at the tree . """
Philip Elton	""" You , sir , may say any thing , """
Philip Elton	""" but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of Miss Smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit ! Any other situation would have been much less in character . The naivete of Miss Smith 's manners -- and altogether -- Oh , it is most admirable ! I can not keep my eyes from it . I never saw such a likeness . """
Philip Elton	""" Might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it ! he could ride to London at any time . It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand . """
Philip Elton	""" What a precious deposit ! """
Philip Elton	""" that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness . """
Philip Elton	""" Oh no ! he had never written , hardly ever , any thing of the kind in his life . The stupidest fellow ! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse""--he"
Philip Elton	"moment--""or Miss Smith could inspire him . """
Philip Elton	""" I do not offer it for Miss Smith 's collection , """
Philip Elton	""" Being my friend 's , I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye , but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it . """
Philip Elton	""" Dear Miss Woodhouse!""--and"
Philip Elton	""" I can not make a question , or listen to a question about that . It is a certainty . Receive it on my judgment . It is a sort of prologue to the play , a motto to the chapter ; and will be soon followed by matter - of - fact prose . """
Philip Elton	""" When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted -- they do indeed -- and really it is strange ; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently , so palpably desirable -- what courts the pre - arrangement of other people , should so immediately shape itself into the proper form . You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes . Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls . There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction , and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow ."
Philip Elton	""" I have no hesitation in saying , """
Philip Elton	""" I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as _ I _ do -- I have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _ I _ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ) , he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life . """
Philip Elton	""" Ah ! Harriet , here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts . Well , ( smiling , ) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important . If we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves . """
Philip Elton	""" A sore - throat!--I hope not infectious . I hope not of a putrid infectious sort . Has Perry seen her ? Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend . Let me entreat you to run no risks . Why does not Perry see her ? """
Philip Elton	""" Oh ! no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard 's door , which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress , I was told that Miss Smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse . Very much grieved and concerned-- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning . """
Philip Elton	""" Yes -- I imagined -- that is -- I did not-- """
Philip Elton	""" Dreadful!--Exactly so , indeed.--She will be missed every moment . """
Philip Elton	""" Christmas weather , """
Philip Elton	""" Quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day 's party , which it might very possibly have done , for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence . This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings . At Christmas every body invites their friends about them , and people think little of even the worst weather . I was snowed up at a friend 's house once for a week . Nothing could be pleasanter . I went for only one night , and could not get away till that very day se'nnight . """
Philip Elton	""" Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!""--"
Philip Elton	""" my son , """
Philip Elton	""" We want only two more to be just the right number . I should like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend , Miss Smith , and my son -- and then I should say we were quite complete . I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting Frank . I had a letter from him this morning , and he will be with us within a fortnight . """
Philip Elton	""" Did she know?--had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably . """
Philip Elton	""" Would not she give him her support?--would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard 's till it were certain that Miss Smith 's disorder had no infection ? He could not be satisfied without a promise-- would not she give him her influence in procuring it ? """
Philip Elton	""" So scrupulous for others , """
Philip Elton	""" and yet so careless for herself ! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to - day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself . Is this fair , Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us . Have not I some right to complain ? I am sure of your kind support and aid . """
Philip Elton	""" Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly mean!""--"
Philip Elton	""" Good Heaven ! """
Philip Elton	""" what can be the meaning of this?-- Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend . If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed!--Oh ! Miss Woodhouse ! who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near ! No , upon my honour , there is no unsteadiness of character . I have thought only of you . I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else . Every thing that I have said or done , for many weeks past , has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself . You can not really , seriously , doubt it . No!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me . """
Philip Elton	""" Charming Miss Woodhouse ! allow me to interpret this interesting silence . It confesses that you have long understood me . """
Philip Elton	""" Ah ! Mr. Knightley , why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton ? """
Philip Elton	""" that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense-- and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them . """
Philip Elton	"beaufet--""Mrs . Cole had just been there , just called in for ten minutes , and had been so good as to sit an hour with them , and _ she _ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much ; and , therefore , she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too . """
Philip Elton	"to.--""Was not it astonishingly like?-- She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove . """
Philip Elton	""" Most readily , Mrs. Weston , if you will dance with me . """
Philip Elton	""" If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance , """
Philip Elton	""" I shall have great pleasure , I am sure -- for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert . """
Philip Elton	""" Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging-- and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over , Mrs. Weston . You will excuse me . Any thing else I should be most happy to do , at your command -- but my dancing days are over . """
Philip Elton	""" When I got to Donwell , """
Philip Elton	""" Knightley could not be found . Very odd ! very unaccountable ! after the note I sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one . """
Philip Elton	""" Donwell ! """
Philip Elton	"wife.--""My dear Mr. E. , you have not been to Donwell!--You mean the Crown ; you come from the meeting at the Crown . """
Philip Elton	""" No , no , that 's to - morrow ; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to - day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!-- I went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill - usage , ) which made it so much the worse . And then not to find him at home ! I assure you I am not at all pleased . And no apology left , no message for me . The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.-- Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone . Perhaps to Hartfield , perhaps to the Abbey Mill , perhaps into his woods.-- Miss Woodhouse , this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain it ? """
Philip Elton	""" I met William Larkins , """
Philip Elton	""" as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour . He did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him . I have nothing to do with William 's wants , but it really is of very great importance that _ I _ should see Knightley to - day ; and it becomes a matter , therefore , of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose . """
Philip Elton	""" the young lady 's pride would now be contented ; """
Philip Elton	""" she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ; """
Philip Elton	""" Rather he than I!""--"
Anna Weston	""" I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston ? I understand it was a very handsome letter , indeed . Mr. Woodhouse told me of it . Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life . """
Anna Weston	""" A bad thing ! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so ? """
Anna Weston	""" You surprize me ! Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good . I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good ! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma , Mr. Knightley . """
Anna Weston	""" Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject . We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with . Mr. Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life . I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith . She is not the superior young woman which Emma 's friend ought to be . But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself . They will read together . She means it , I know . """
Anna Weston	""" I dare say , """
Anna Weston	""" that I thought so _ then_;--but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma 's omitting to do any thing I wished . """
Anna Weston	""" So do I , """
Anna Weston	""" very much . """
Anna Weston	""" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present , """
Anna Weston	""" as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I can not wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse 's account . I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma , though I mean no slight to the state , I assure you . """
Anna Weston	""" Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted,""--observed"
Anna Weston	"lover.--""The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes . It is the fault of her face that she has them not . """
Anna Weston	""" for I can not depend upon his coming . I can not be so sanguine as Mr. Weston . I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing . Mr. Weston , I dare say , has been telling you exactly how the matter stands ? """
Anna Weston	""" Yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of Mrs. Churchill , which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world . """
Anna Weston	""" My Emma ! """
Anna Weston	""" what is the certainty of caprice ? """
Anna Weston	"before--""You must know , my dear Mrs. Knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks . It depends entirely upon his aunt 's spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper . To you -- to my two daughters -- I may venture on the truth . Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe , and is a very odd - tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends upon her being willing to spare him . """
Anna Weston	""" One ought to be at Enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do , """
Anna Weston	""" One ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but Enscombe , I believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _ she _ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her . """
Anna Weston	""" My dearest Emma , do not pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a bad one , or to lay down rules for it : you must let it go its own way . I have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _ when _ it will be . """
Anna Weston	""" He may have a great deal of influence on some points , """
Anna Weston	""" and on others , very little : and among those , on which she is beyond his reach , it is but too likely , may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us . """
Anna Weston	""" very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period . """
Anna Weston	""" Think of me to - morrow , my dear Emma , about four o'clock , """
Anna Weston	"Highbury.--""He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same . Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction . ""--"
Anna Weston	""" You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , """
Anna Weston	""" remember that I am here.--Mr . Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax 's situation in life . I will move a little farther off . """
Anna Weston	""" all young people would have their little whims . """
Anna Weston	""" all young people would have their little whims . """
Anna Weston	""" I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out , """
Anna Weston	""" I am not fond of dinner - visiting , """
Anna Weston	"he--""I never was . No more is Emma . Late hours do not agree with us . I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it . I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to . However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr. Knightley too , to take care of her , I can not wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy . """
Anna Weston	"reproach--""Ah ! Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me . """
Anna Weston	""" my excellent friend Colonel Campbell . """
Anna Weston	""" This is the luxury of a large party , """
Anna Weston	"she:--""one can get near every body , and say every thing . My dear Emma , I am longing to talk to you . I have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and I must tell them while the idea is fresh . Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here ? """
Anna Weston	""" How?--They were invited , were not they ? """
Anna Weston	""" Oh ! yes -- but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their coming ? """
Anna Weston	""" They walked , I conclude . How else could they come ? """
Anna Weston	""" Very true.--Well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now . And as I looked at her , though I never saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold . Poor girl ! I could not bear the idea of it ; so , as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room , and I could get at him , I spoke to him about the carriage . You may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , I made my way directly to Miss Bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once . Good soul ! she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure . ` Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many , many thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us , for Mr. Knightley 's carriage had brought , and was to take them home again . ' I was quite surprized;--very glad , I am sure ; but really quite surprized . Such a very kind attention -- and so thoughtful an attention!-- the sort of thing that so few men would think of . And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all . I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them . """
Anna Weston	""" Very likely , """
Anna Weston	"Emma--""nothing more likely . I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent . He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax 's ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley . I know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray . """
Anna Weston	""" Well , """
Anna Weston	""" you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again . The more I think of it , the more probable it appears . In short , I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax . See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to it ? """
Anna Weston	""" My dear Emma , I have told you what led me to think of it . I do not want the match -- I do not want to injure dear little Henry-- but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry 's account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ? """
Anna Weston	""" Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know . """
Anna Weston	""" I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability . """
Anna Weston	""" Imprudent , if you please -- but not mad . Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable . """
Anna Weston	""" My dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax-- """
Anna Weston	""" Well , """
Anna Weston	""" perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give Jane such a respectable home . """
Anna Weston	""" For shame , Emma ! Do not mimic her . You divert me against my conscience . And , upon my word , I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates . Little things do not irritate him . She might talk on ; and if he wanted to say any thing himself , he would only talk louder , and drown her voice . But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does . I have heard him speak , and so must you , so very highly of Jane Fairfax ! The interest he takes in her-- his anxiety about her health -- his concern that she should have no happier prospect ! I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice ! I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever . Oh ! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody-- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr. Knightley ? I can not help suspecting him . I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love . """
Anna Weston	""" I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him . """
Anna Weston	""" There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma . I have a very strong notion that it comes from him . I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner . """
Anna Weston	""" For my companion tells me , """
Anna Weston	""" that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning . I was not aware of it myself . I did not know that I had fixed a day , but as he says I did , I am going now . """
Anna Weston	""" I thought you meant to go with me . They would be very much pleased . """
Anna Weston	""" Me ! I should be quite in the way . But , perhaps -- I may be equally in the way here . Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me . My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping . She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same . What am I to do ? """
Anna Weston	""" Well -- if you advise it.--But ( with a smile ) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall I say ? I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston . She might do very well by herself . A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood . """
Anna Weston	"Emma.--""I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent . Quite otherwise indeed , if I understood Miss Fairfax 's opinion last night . """
Anna Weston	""" Do come with me , """
Anna Weston	""" if it be not very disagreeable to you . It need not detain us long . We will go to Hartfield afterwards . We will follow them to Hartfield . I really wish you to call with me . It will be felt so great an attention ! and I always thought you meant it . """
Anna Weston	""" What ! """
Anna Weston	""" have not you finished it yet ? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate . """
Anna Weston	""" I do not think it _ is _ so very small . We shall not be many , you know . """
Anna Weston	""" You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear . It is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs . """
Anna Weston	""" I wish , """
Anna Weston	""" one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best . To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object -- if one could but tell what that would be . """
Anna Weston	""" Well -- if you please , """
Anna Weston	""" if you think she will be of any use . """
Anna Weston	""" But she is so amusing , so extremely amusing ! I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk . And I need not bring the whole family , you know . """
Anna Weston	""" Aye , do , Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us end the matter at once . She will enjoy the scheme , I am sure ; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties . Fetch Miss Bates . We are growing a little too nice . She is a standing lesson of how to be happy . But fetch them both . Invite them both . """
Anna Weston	""" The old lady ! No , the young lady , to be sure . I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece . """
Anna Weston	""" Oh ! I beg your pardon , sir . I did not immediately recollect . Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both . """
Anna Weston	""" that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon . """
Anna Weston	""" I should not wonder , """
Anna Weston	""" if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt 's eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton 's civilities for her . Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change . """
Anna Weston	""" My advice , """
Anna Weston	""" I certainly do feel tempted to give . Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks.-- Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year . The spring I always think requires more than common care . Better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again . Now do not you feel that you had ? Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable . You look as if you would not do such a thing again . """
Anna Weston	""" I never saw any gentleman 's handwriting""--Emma"
Anna Weston	""" Now , how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend-- your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way , I suppose , if I were very bad.--No , I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress . I certainly get better and better.--Now for it . """
Anna Weston	""" Do not you dance , Mr. Elton ? """
Anna Weston	""" Me!--oh ! no -- I would get you a better partner than myself . I am no dancer . """
Anna Weston	""" Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- Miss Smith . """
Anna Weston	""" what became of Mr. Perry 's plan of setting up his carriage ? """
Anna Weston	""" I did not know that he ever had any such plan . """
Anna Weston	""" Me ! impossible ! """
Anna Weston	""" Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment . """
Anna Weston	""" What is it my dear friend ? Something of a very unpleasant nature , I find , has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is . I have been walking all this way in complete suspense . We both abhor suspense . Do not let mine continue longer . It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be . """
Anna Weston	""" Have you indeed no idea ? """
Anna Weston	""" Can not you , my dear Emma -- cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear ? """
Anna Weston	""" So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill , I do guess . """
Anna Weston	""" You are right . It does relate to him , and I will tell you directly ; """
Anna Weston	""" He has been here this very morning , on a most extraordinary errand . It is impossible to express our surprize . He came to speak to his father on a subject,--to announce an attachment-- """
Anna Weston	""" More than an attachment , indeed , """
Anna Weston	""" an engagement-- a positive engagement.--What will you say , Emma -- what will any body say , when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged;--nay , that they have been long engaged ! """
Anna Weston	""" You may well be amazed , """
Anna Weston	""" You may well be amazed . But it is even so . There has been a solemn engagement between them ever since October -- formed at Weymouth , and kept a secret from every body . Not a creature knowing it but themselves -- neither the Campbells , nor her family , nor his.-- It is so wonderful , that though perfectly convinced of the fact , it is yet almost incredible to myself . I can hardly believe it.-- I thought I knew him . """
Anna Weston	""" Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself , """
Anna Weston	""" On this point we have been wretched . It was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other -- and we were persuaded that it was so.-- Imagine what we have been feeling on your account . """
Anna Weston	""" I have escaped ; and that I should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself . But this does not acquit _ him _ , Mrs. Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame . What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged , and with manners so _ very _ disengaged ? What right had he to endeavour to please , as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention , as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?-- How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?-- very wrong , very wrong indeed . """
Anna Weston	""" From something that he said , my dear Emma , I rather imagine-- """
Anna Weston	""" And how could _ she _ bear such behaviour ! Composure with a witness ! to look on , while repeated attentions were offering to another woman , before her face , and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity , which I can neither comprehend nor respect . """
Anna Weston	""" There were misunderstandings between them , Emma ; he said so expressly . He had not time to enter into much explanation . He was here only a quarter of an hour , and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay-- but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said . The present crisis , indeed , seemed to be brought on by them ; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct . """
Anna Weston	""" Impropriety ! Oh ! Mrs. Weston -- it is too calm a censure . Much , much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him , I can not say how it has sunk him in my opinion . So unlike what a man should be!-- None of that upright integrity , that strict adherence to truth and principle , that disdain of trick and littleness , which a man should display in every transaction of his life . """
Anna Weston	""" Nay , dear Emma , now I must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , I have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and-- """
Anna Weston	"her.--""Mrs . Smallridge , too ! Jane actually on the point of going as governess ! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy ? To suffer her to engage herself-- to suffer her even to think of such a measure ! """
Anna Weston	""" He knew nothing about it , Emma . On this article I can fully acquit him . It was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.-- Till yesterday , I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans . They burst on him , I do not know how , but by some letter or message-- and it was the discovery of what she was doing , of this very project of hers , which determined him to come forward at once , own it all to his uncle , throw himself on his kindness , and , in short , put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long . """
Anna Weston	""" I am to hear from him soon , """
Anna Weston	""" He told me at parting , that he should soon write ; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now . Let us wait , therefore , for this letter . It may bring many extenuations . It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood . Do n't let us be severe , do n't let us be in a hurry to condemn him . Let us have patience . I must love him ; and now that I am satisfied on one point , the one material point , I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may . They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment . """
Anna Weston	""" Most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty . Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family ! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived , I suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility;--but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required . What a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave!-- He gave his consent with very little persuasion . """
Anna Weston	""" This was settled last night , and Frank was off with the light this morning . He stopped at Highbury , at the Bates 's , I fancy , some time -- and then came on hither ; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle , to whom he is just now more necessary than ever , that , as I tell you , he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.-- He was very much agitated -- very much , indeed -- to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.--In addition to all the rest , there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell , which he had had no previous suspicion of-- and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal . """
Anna Weston	""" None ; not one . He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves . """
Anna Weston	""" I am quite easy on that head , """
Anna Weston	""" I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other , which both might not have heard . """
Anna Weston	""" True . But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax , I never could , under any blunder , have spoken ill of her ; and as to speaking ill of him , there I must have been safe . """
Anna Weston	""" On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months , """
Anna Weston	""" she was energetic . This was one of her expressions . ` I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'-- and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart . """
Anna Weston	""" Wrong ! No one , I believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself . ` The consequence , ' said she , ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought . But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct . Pain is no expiation . I never can be blameless . I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right ; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken , and the kindness I am now receiving , is what my conscience tells me ought not to be . ' ` Do not imagine , madam , ' she continued , ` that I was taught wrong . Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up . The error has been all my own ; and I do assure you that , with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give , I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell . ' """
Anna Weston	""" Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him . """
Anna Weston	""" We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come , """
Anna Weston	""" Are you well , my Emma ? """
Anna Weston	""" Oh ! perfectly . I am always well , you know . Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible . """
Anna Weston	""" It is Frank and Miss Fairfax , """
Anna Weston	""" I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning . He stays till to - morrow , and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us.--They are coming in , I hope . """
Anna Weston	""" I declare , I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument . It seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away . This is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure ! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with.--I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought-- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening . """
Anna Weston	""" Nay , why do you ? """
Anna Weston	""" Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell 's being so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present . """
Anna Weston	""" Very . """
Anna Weston	""" I rather wonder that it was never made before . """
Anna Weston	""" Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before . """
Anna Weston	""" Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument-- which must now be shut up in London , untouched by any body . """
Anna Weston	""" That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs. Bates 's house . """
Anna Weston	""" You may _ say _ what you chuse -- but your countenance testifies that your _ thoughts _ on this subject are very much like mine . """
Anna Weston	""" I do not know . I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve . I smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; but at present I do not see what there is to question . If Colonel Campbell is not the person , who can be ? """
Anna Weston	""" What do you say to Mrs. Dixon ? """
Anna Weston	""" Mrs. Dixon ! very true indeed . I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon . She must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman 's scheme than an elderly man 's . It is Mrs. Dixon , I dare say . I told you that your suspicions would guide mine . """
Anna Weston	""" If so , you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _ Mr _ . Dixon in them . """
Anna Weston	""" Mr. Dixon.--Very well . Yes , I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon . We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance . """
Anna Weston	""" Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I can not help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _ her _ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side . One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland . Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment . As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body 's native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ? Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and I dare say in her 's . I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are . """
Anna Weston	""" And , upon my word , they have an air of great probability . Mr. Dixon 's preference of her music to her friend 's , I can answer for being very decided . """
Anna Weston	""" And then , he saved her life . Did you ever hear of that?-- A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard . He caught her . """
Anna Weston	""" He did . I was there -- one of the party . """
Anna Weston	""" Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there , I think I should have made some discoveries . """
Anna Weston	""" I dare say you would ; but I , simple I , saw nothing but the fact , that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her.--It was the work of a moment . And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again-- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable . I do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries . """
Anna Weston	""" very pleasant and very elegantly dressed . """
Anna Weston	""" Very well , I thank you , ma'am . I hope you are quite well . Very happy to hear it . So afraid you might have a headache!-- seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have . Delighted to hear it indeed . Ah ! dear Mrs. Elton , so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent time . Jane and I quite ready . Did not keep the horses a moment . Most comfortable carriage.-- Oh ! and I am sure our thanks are due to you , Mrs. Weston , on that score . Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been.-- But two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours . I said to my mother , ` Upon my word , ma'am-- . ' Thank you , my mother is remarkably well . Gone to Mr. Woodhouse 's . I made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl-- Mrs. Dixon 's wedding - present.--So kind of her to think of my mother ! Bought at Weymouth , you know -- Mr. Dixon 's choice . There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time . Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive . My dear Jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two , but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely-- and there was a mat to step upon -- I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh ! Mr. Frank Churchill , I must tell you my mother 's spectacles have never been in fault since ; the rivet never came out again . My mother often talks of your good - nature . Does not she , Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?-- Ah ! here 's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do?-- Very well I thank you , quite well . This is meeting quite in fairy - land!-- Such a transformation!--Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude -- but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look -- how do you like Jane 's hair?--You are a judge.-- She did it all herself . Quite wonderful how she does her hair!-- No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah ! Dr. Hughes I declare-- and Mrs. Hughes . Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.--How do you do ? How do you do?--Very well , I thank you . This is delightful , is not it?--Where 's dear Mr. Richard?-- Oh ! there he is . Do n't disturb him . Much better employed talking to the young ladies . How do you do , Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- Mrs. Otway , I protest!-- and good Mr. Otway , and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do ? How do you all do?--Quite well , I am much obliged to you . Never better.-- Do n't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends ! And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted . No coffee , I thank you , for me -- never take coffee.--A little tea if you please , sir , by and bye,--no hurry -- Oh ! here it comes . Every thing so good ! """
Anna Weston	"continued--""like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis ' Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan . """
Augusta Elton	""" My brother Mr. Suckling 's seat;""--a"
Augusta Elton	""" Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at Maple Grove ; her sister 's favourite room . ""--"
Augusta Elton	""" And the staircase -- You know , as I came in , I observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house . I really could not help exclaiming ! I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove . I have spent so many happy months there ! ( with a little sigh of sentiment ) . A charming place , undoubtedly . Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home . Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind . I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony . """
Augusta Elton	""" So extremely like Maple Grove ! And it is not merely the house-- the grounds , I assure you , as far as I could observe , are strikingly like . The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way -- just across the lawn ; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind ! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place . People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style . """
Augusta Elton	""" When you have seen more of this country , I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield . Surry is full of beauties . """
Augusta Elton	""" Oh ! yes , I am quite aware of that . It is the garden of England , you know . Surry is the garden of England . """
Augusta Elton	""" Yes ; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction . Many counties , I believe , are called the garden of England , as well as Surry . """
Augusta Elton	""" No , I fancy not , """
Augusta Elton	""" I never heard any county but Surry called so . """
Augusta Elton	""" My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest , """
Augusta Elton	""" and that will be our time for exploring . While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say . They will have their barouche - landau , of course , which holds four perfectly ; and therefore , without saying any thing of _ our _ carriage , we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well . They would hardly come in their chaise , I think , at that season of the year . Indeed , when the time draws on , I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable . When people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring . We explored to King's - Weston twice last summer , in that way , most delightfully , just after their first having the barouche - landau . You have many parties of that kind here , I suppose , Miss Woodhouse , every summer ? """
Augusta Elton	""" No ; not immediately here . We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure . """
Augusta Elton	""" Ah ! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort . Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am . I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove . Many a time has Selina said , when she has been going to Bristol , ` I really can not get this girl to move from the house . I absolutely must go in by myself , though I hate being stuck up in the barouche - landau without a companion ; but Augusta , I believe , with her own good - will , would never stir beyond the park paling . ' Many a time has she said so ; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion . I think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little . I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse-- ( looking towards Mr. Woodhouse ) , Your father 's state of health must be a great drawback . Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should . Let me recommend Bath to you . I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good . """
Augusta Elton	""" My father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr. Perry , whose name , I dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now . """
Augusta Elton	""" Ah ! that 's a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give . In my Bath life , I have seen such instances of it ! And it is so cheerful a place , that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse 's spirits , which , I understand , are sometimes much depressed . And as to its recommendations to _ you _ , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them . The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood . It would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place . A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , Mrs. Partridge , the lady I have always resided with when in Bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with . """
Augusta Elton	""" but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father . """
Augusta Elton	""" I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs. Elton . Upon these occasions , a lady 's character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer . """
Augusta Elton	""" Oh ! no , indeed ; I must protest against any such idea . A superior performer!--very far from it , I assure you . Consider from how partial a quarter your information came . I am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _ mediocre _ to the last degree . You , Miss Woodhouse , I well know , play delightfully . I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into . I absolutely can not do without music . It is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at Maple Grove and in Bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice . I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the house too -- knowing what I had been accustomed to -- of course he was not wholly without apprehension . When he was speaking of it in that way , I honestly said that _ the _ _ world _ I could give up -- parties , balls , plays -- for I had no fear of retirement . Blessed with so many resources within myself , the world was not necessary to _ me _ . I could do very well without it . To those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent . And as to smaller - sized rooms than I had been used to , I really could not give it a thought . I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description . Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove ; but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , nor were spacious apartments . ` But , ' said I , ` to be quite honest , I do not think I can live without something of a musical society . I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me . ' """
Augusta Elton	""" No , indeed , I have no doubts at all on that head . I am delighted to find myself in such a circle . I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together . I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours . Will not it be a good plan ? If _ we _ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies . Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _ me _ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know-- there is a sad story against them , in general . They are but too apt to give up music . """
Augusta Elton	""" I should hope not ; but really when I look around among my acquaintance , I tremble . Selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly . And the same may be said of Mrs. Jeffereys -- Clara Partridge , that was -- and of the two Milmans , now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper ; and of more than I can enumerate . Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright . I used to be quite angry with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention . I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper . """
Augusta Elton	""" Well , """
Augusta Elton	""" we shall see . """
Augusta Elton	""" We have been calling at Randalls , """
Augusta Elton	""" and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be . I like them extremely . Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature-- quite a first - rate favourite with me already , I assure you . And _ she _ appears so truly good -- there is something so motherly and kind - hearted about her , that it wins upon one directly . She was your governess , I think ? """
Augusta Elton	""" Having understood as much , I was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like ! But she is really quite the gentlewoman . """
Augusta Elton	""" And who do you think came in while we were there ? """
Augusta Elton	""" Knightley ! """
Augusta Elton	""" Knightley himself!--Was not it lucky?--for , not being within when he called the other day , I had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr. E. 's , I had a great curiosity . ` My friend Knightley ' had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend . Knightley is quite the gentleman . I like him very much . Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman - like man . """
Augusta Elton	""" Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet , interesting creature . So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents . I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well . I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point . Oh ! she is absolutely charming ! You will laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.-- And her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her . We must bring her forward . Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet ,"
Augusta Elton	""" My dear Jane , what is this I hear?--Going to the post - office in the rain!--This must not be , I assure you.--You sad girl , how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you . """
Augusta Elton	""" Oh ! do not tell _ me _ . You really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself.--To the post - office indeed ! Mrs. Weston , did you ever hear the like ? You and I must positively exert our authority . """
Augusta Elton	""" Oh ! she _ shall _ _ not _ do such a thing again , """
Augusta Elton	""" We will not allow her to do such a thing again:""--"
Augusta Elton	"significantly--""there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed . I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning ( one of our men , I forget his name ) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you . That will obviate all difficulties you know ; and from _ us _ I really think , my dear Jane , you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation . """
Augusta Elton	""" My dear Jane , say no more about it . The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master . You know , Mrs. Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves . But I do flatter myself , my dear Jane , that my influence is not entirely worn out . If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled . """
Augusta Elton	""" Oh ! my dear ; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness to employ our men . """
Augusta Elton	""" Something that would do ! """
Augusta Elton	""" Aye , _ that _ may suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life . """
Augusta Elton	""" I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle . Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is -- I do not know-- if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play;--yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest . """
Augusta Elton	""" And I am quite serious too , I assure you , """
Augusta Elton	""" in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us . """
Augusta Elton	""" Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest!--Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature he is;--I assure you I like him excessively . I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me . But this good old Mr. Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner . Oh ! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous . I fancy I am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown . How do you like it?--Selina 's choice -- handsome , I think , but I do not know whether it is not over - trimmed ; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed -- quite a horror of finery . I must put on a few ornaments now , because it is expected of me . A bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery . But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery are every thing . I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin . Do you think it will look well ? """
Augusta Elton	""" No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing . I Always take the part of my own sex . I do indeed . I give you notice -- You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point . I always stand up for women-- and I assure you , if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill 's making incredible exertions to avoid it . Selina says it is quite horror to her -- and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety . She always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution . Does Mrs. Churchill do the same ? """
Augusta Elton	""" Oh ! Mr. Weston , do not mistake me . Selina is no fine lady , I assure you . Do not run away with such an idea . """
Augusta Elton	""" If she is really ill , why not go to Bath , Mr. Weston?--To Bath , or to Clifton ? """
Augusta Elton	""" Aye -- like Maple Grove , I dare say . Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove . Such an immense plantation all round it ! You seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement.-- And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion . Or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life . I always say a woman can not have too many resources -- and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society . """
Augusta Elton	""" So I remember to have heard . He will find an _ addition _ to the society of Highbury when he comes again ; that is , if I may presume to call myself an addition . But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world . """
Augusta Elton	""" A very fine young man indeed , Mr. Weston . You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him.--You may believe me . I never compliment . I think him a very handsome young man , and his manners are precisely what I like and approve -- so truly the gentleman , without the least conceit or puppyism . You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies-- quite a horror of them . They were never tolerated at Maple Grove . Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them ; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things ! Selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better . """
Augusta Elton	""" I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane . Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.-- What a pleasure it is to send one 's carriage for a friend!-- I understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary . You may be very sure I shall always take care of _ them _ . """
Augusta Elton	""" How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?-- How has Wright done my hair?""--with"
Augusta Elton	""" Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do -- but upon such an occasion as this , when every body 's eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the Westons -- who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour -- I would not wish to be inferior to others . And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.-- So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand.--We shall see if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill . I like him very well . """
Augusta Elton	""" Oh ! you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion?-- I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us . """
Augusta Elton	""" Jane!""--repeated"
Augusta Elton	""" That is easy -- but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose . """
Augusta Elton	""" Not at all . """
Augusta Elton	""" You are ungrateful . """
Augusta Elton	""" Is not this most vexations , Knightley ? """
Augusta Elton	"cried.--""And such weather for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious . What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done . Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston . """
Augusta Elton	""" Oh ! I should like it of all things , """
Augusta Elton	""" You may depend upon me , """
Augusta Elton	""" I certainly will come . Name your day , and I will come . You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax ? """
Augusta Elton	""" Oh ! leave all that to me . Only give me a carte - blanche.--I am Lady Patroness , you know . It is my party . I will bring friends with me . """
Augusta Elton	""" Oh ! now you are looking very sly . But consider -- you need not be afraid of delegating power to _ me _ . I am no young lady on her preferment . Married women , you know , may be safely authorised . It is my party . Leave it all to me . I will invite your guests . """
Augusta Elton	"replied,--""there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one is-- """
Augusta Elton	""" --Mrs . Weston , I suppose , """
Augusta Elton	""" No -- Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself . """
Augusta Elton	""" Ah ! you are an odd creature ! """
Augusta Elton	"herself.--""You are a humourist , and may say what you like . Quite a humourist . Well , I shall bring Jane with me-- Jane and her aunt.--The rest I leave to you . I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family . Do n't scruple . I know you are attached to them . """
Augusta Elton	""" You certainly will meet them if I can prevail ; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home . """
Augusta Elton	""" That 's quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every day:--but as you like . It is to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley ; quite a simple thing . I shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm . Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon . Nothing can be more simple , you see . And Jane will have such another . There is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party . We are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors -- a table spread in the shade , you know . Every thing as natural and simple as possible . Is not that your idea ? """
Augusta Elton	""" Not quite . My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room . The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , I think is best observed by meals within doors . When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house . """
Augusta Elton	""" Well -- as you please ; only do n't have a great set out . And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?-- Pray be sincere , Knightley . If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges , or to inspect anything-- """
Augusta Elton	""" I have not the least wish for it , I thank you . """
Augusta Elton	""" Well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever . """
Augusta Elton	""" I will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body 's assistance . """
Augusta Elton	""" I wish we had a donkey . The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me -- and my caro sposo walking by . I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary ; for , let a woman have ever so many resources , it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;--and very long walks , you know -- in summer there is dust , and in winter there is dirt . """
Augusta Elton	""" You will not find either , between Donwell and Highbury . Donwell Lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry . Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it . You can borrow Mrs. Cole 's . I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible . """
Augusta Elton	""" That I am sure you would . Indeed I do you justice , my good friend . Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart . As I tell Mr. E. , you are a thorough humourist.-- Yes , believe me , Knightley , I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme . You have hit upon the very thing to please me . """
Augusta Elton	"of.--""The best fruit in England-- every body 's favourite -- always wholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one 's self -- the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time -- never tired-- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison-- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce -- Chili preferred-- white wood finest flavour of all -- price of strawberries in London-- abundance about Bristol -- Maple Grove -- cultivation -- beds when to be renewed -- gardeners thinking exactly different -- no general rule-- gardeners never to be put out of their way -- delicious fruit-- only too rich to be eaten much of -- inferior to cherries-- currants more refreshing -- only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping -- glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer-- must go and sit in the shade . """
Augusta Elton	""" Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ? """
Augusta Elton	""" It is a sort of thing , """
Augusta Elton	""" which _ I _ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into . Though , perhaps , as the _ Chaperon _ of the party-- _ I _ never was in any circle -- exploring parties -- young ladies -- married women-- """
Augusta Elton	""" Oh ! for myself , I protest I must be excused , """
Augusta Elton	""" _ I _ really can not attempt -- I am not at all fond of the sort of thing . I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with . I knew who it came from . An abominable puppy!-- You know who I mean ( nodding to her husband ) . These kind of things are very well at Christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer . Miss Woodhouse must excuse me . I am not one of those who have witty things at every body 's service . I do not pretend to be a wit . I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue . Pass us , if you please , Mr. Churchill . Pass Mr. E. , Knightley , Jane , and myself . We have nothing clever to say-- not one of us ."
Augusta Elton	""" Yes , here I am , my good friend ; and here I have been so long , that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that I am waiting for my lord and master . He promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you . """
Augusta Elton	""" What ! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?-- That will be a favour indeed ! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr. Elton 's time is so engaged . """
Augusta Elton	""" I do believe , """
Augusta Elton	""" this is the most troublesome parish that ever was . We never heard of such things at Maple Grove . """
Augusta Elton	""" But it is proved by the smallness of the school , which I have heard you speak of , as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge ; the only school , and not more than five - and - twenty children . """
Augusta Elton	""" I can not imagine , """
Augusta Elton	""" I can not imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world ! The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E. , he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;-- and his servants forgot it . Depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants , who are all , I have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration . And as for Mrs. Hodges , Wright holds her very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt , and never sent it . """
Augusta Elton	"indeed.--""Poor Knightley ! poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was extremely concerned ; for , though very eccentric , he had a thousand good qualities.-- How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love-- not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him ! But that would be all over now.-- Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _ her _ . Oh ! no ; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every thing.--Extremely disagreeable ! But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan , living together . It would never do . She knew a family near Maple Grove who had tried it , and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter ."
Augusta Elton	"own.--""Very little white satin , very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard of it . ""--But"
Mr. Weston	""" What does Weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ? """
Mr. Weston	""" my son , """
Mr. Weston	""" Frank , """
Mr. Weston	""" He has been wanting to come to us , """
Mr. Weston	""" ever since September : every letter has been full of it ; but he can not command his own time . He has those to please who must be pleased , and who ( between ourselves ) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices . But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January . """
Mr. Weston	""" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off . She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do . The case , you see , is--(but this is quite between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room . There are secrets in all families , you know)--The case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January ; and that Frank 's coming depends upon their being put off . If they are not put off , he can not stir . But I know they will , because it is a family that a certain lady , of some consequence , at Enscombe , has a particular dislike to : and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years , they always are put off when it comes to the point . I have not the smallest doubt of the issue . I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January , as I am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at Hartfield , that she can not calculate on their effects , as I have been long in the practice of doing . """
Mr. Weston	""" How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father-- glad to see him so well . Frank comes to - morrow -- I had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty-- he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so . If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days ; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather . We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish . """
Mr. Weston	""" I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield , """
Mr. Weston	""" Well , well , I am ready;""--and"
Mr. Weston	""" but you must not be expecting such a _ very _ fine young man ; you have only had _ my _ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:""--"
Mr. Weston	""" Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three , """
Mr. Weston	""" I told you yesterday , """
Mr. Weston	""" I told you all that he would be here before the time named . I remembered what I used to do myself . One can not creep upon a journey ; one can not help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one 's friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs . """
Mr. Weston	"move.--""He must be going . He had business at the Crown about his hay , and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford 's , but he need not hurry any body else . """
Mr. Weston	""" As you are going farther on business , sir , I will take the opportunity of paying a visit , which must be paid some day or other , and therefore may as well be paid now . I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma , ) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax . I shall have no difficulty , I suppose , in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I believe , is not the proper name -- I should rather say Barnes , or Bates . Do you know any family of that name ? """
Mr. Weston	""" Well , sir , """
Mr. Weston	""" as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment , if you wish it . """
Mr. Weston	""" But , my dear sir , """
Mr. Weston	""" if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party . """
Mr. Weston	""" Both sir ! Can the old lady ? """
Mr. Weston	""" He has asked her , my dear . That 's right . I knew he would ! """
Mr. Weston	""" Read it , read it , """
Mr. Weston	""" it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma . """
Mr. Weston	""" Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think . Well , what do you say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I?--Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me?--In town next week , you see -- at the latest , I dare say ; for _ she _ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or Saturday . As to her illness , all nothing of course . But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again , so near as town . They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us . This is precisely what I wanted . Well , pretty good news , is not it ? Have you finished it ? Has Emma read it all ? Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now . I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way . """
Mr. Weston	""" I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you , """
Mr. Weston	""" You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume , """
Mr. Weston	""" and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name . """
Mr. Weston	""" Oh ! yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance . I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage . """
Mr. Weston	""" You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy , I am sure.-- He is to be in town next week , if not sooner . We have notice of it in a letter to - day . I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son 's hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to Mrs. Weston . She is his principal correspondent , I assure you . I hardly ever get a letter . """
Mr. Weston	""" And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her ! Oh ! Mr. Weston-- ( laughing affectedly ) I must protest against that.--A most dangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.--Upon my word , if this is what I am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh ! Mr. Weston , I could not have believed it of you ! """
Mr. Weston	""" Aye , we men are sad fellows . You must take care of yourself , Mrs. Elton.--This letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs. Churchill 's account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her-- so they are all to move southward without loss of time . """
Mr. Weston	""" Indeed!--from Yorkshire , I think . Enscombe is in Yorkshire ? """
Mr. Weston	""" Yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London . a considerable journey . """
Mr. Weston	""" Yes , upon my word , very considerable . Sixty - five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London . But what is distance , Mr. Weston , to people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother , Mr. Suckling , sometimes flies about . You will hardly believe me-- but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses . """
Mr. Weston	""" The evil of the distance from Enscombe , """
Mr. Weston	""" is , that Mrs. Churchill , _ as _ _ we _ _ understand _ , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together . In Frank 's last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle 's ! This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word . Certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs. Elton . You must grant me that . """
Mr. Weston	""" Depend upon it , Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did . Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for""--"
Mr. Weston	""" Is not she ? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld . """
Mr. Weston	""" Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces , as you may suspect-- but this is quite between ourselves . She is very fond of Frank , and therefore I would not speak ill of her . Besides , she is out of health now ; but _ that _ indeed , by her own account , she has always been . I would not say so to every body , Mrs. Elton , but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill 's illness . """
Mr. Weston	""" She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her . The fact is , I suppose , that she is tired of Enscombe . She has now been a longer time stationary there , than she ever was before , and she begins to want change . It is a retired place . A fine place , but very retired . """
Mr. Weston	""" Frank was here in February for a fortnight . """
Mr. Weston	""" My dear madam ! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible . Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston 's letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton . """
Mr. Weston	""" When Frank left us , """
Mr. Weston	""" it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day 's news doubly welcome . It has been completely unexpected . That is , _ I _ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me . He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding . ` How could he contrive to come ? And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ? ' and so forth -- I always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see . I have observed , Mrs. Elton , in the course of my life , that if things are going untowardly one month , they are sure to mend the next . """
Mr. Weston	""" I hope , """
Mr. Weston	""" I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill . If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish . You can not be ignorant , Mrs. Elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment I have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her . She was the instigator . Frank 's mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her . Mr. Churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife 's : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence ! And what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood . She was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out - Churchill'd them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , I assure you , she is an upstart . """
Mr. Weston	""" But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax ! """
Mr. Weston	""" We thought you were to bring them . """
Mr. Weston	""" And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ? """
Mr. Weston	""" She will think Frank ought to ask her . """
Mr. Weston	""" What is this?--What is this ? """
Mr. Weston	""" about Perry and a carriage ? Is Perry going to set up his carriage , Frank ? I am glad he can afford it . You had it from himself , had you ? """
Mr. Weston	""" I am glad you approve of what I have done , """
Mr. Weston	""" But I thought you would . Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers . One can not have too large a party . A large party secures its own amusement . And she is a good - natured woman after all . One could not leave her out . """
Mr. Weston	""" I like your plan , """
Mr. Weston	""" Agreed , agreed . I will do my best . I am making a conundrum . How will a conundrum reckon ? """
Mr. Weston	""" Low , I am afraid , sir , very low , """
Mr. Weston	""" I doubt its being very clever myself , """
Mr. Weston	""" It is too much a matter of fact , but here it is.--What two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ? """
Mr. Weston	""" Ah ! you will never guess . You , ( to Emma ) , I am certain , will never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em - ma.--Do you understand ? """
Mr. Weston	""" Poor Mrs. Churchill ! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper . It was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults , what would Mr. Churchill do without her ? Mr. Churchill 's loss would be dreadful indeed . Mr. Churchill would never get over it . ""--"
Mr. Weston	""" Ah ! poor woman , who would have thought it ! """
Mr. Weston	""" could not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak with her . ""--"
Mr. Weston	""" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do , if it be possible . Mrs. Weston wants to see you . She must see you . """
Mr. Weston	""" Is she unwell ? """
Mr. Weston	""" No , no , not at all -- only a little agitated . She would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _ alone _ , and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come ? """
Mr. Weston	""" Certainly . This moment , if you please . It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way . But what can be the matter?-- Is she really not ill ? """
Mr. Weston	""" Depend upon me -- but ask no more questions . You will know it all in time . The most unaccountable business ! But hush , hush ! """
Mr. Weston	""" Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did . """
Mr. Weston	"Randalls.--""Well , my dear , """
Mr. Weston	"room--""I have brought her , and now I hope you will soon be better . I shall leave you together . There is no use in delay . I shall not be far off , if you want me . ""--"
Mr. Weston	"room,--""I have been as good as my word . She has not the least idea . """
Mr. Weston	""" A very pretty trick you have been playing me , upon my word ! This was a device , I suppose , to sport with my curiosity , and exercise my talent of guessing . But you really frightened me . I thought you had lost half your property , at least . And here , instead of its being a matter of condolence , it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I congratulate you , Mr. Weston , with all my heart , on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter . """
Mr. Weston	""" such things , """
Mr. Weston	""" always got about . """
Mr. Weston	""" It is to be a secret , I conclude , """
Mr. Weston	""" These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them . Only let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion . """
Miss Bates	""" You are extremely kind , """
Miss Bates	""" you who are such a judge , and write so beautifully yourself . I am sure there is nobody 's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse 's . My mother does not hear ; she is a little deaf you know . Ma'am , """
Miss Bates	""" do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane 's handwriting ? """
Miss Bates	""" My mother 's deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all . By only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice . But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me . Jane speaks so distinct ! However , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother 's time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here . We never were so long without seeing her before , and as I was telling Mrs. Cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now . """
Miss Bates	""" Oh yes ; next week . """
Miss Bates	""" Thank you . You are very kind . Yes , next week . Every body is so surprized ; and every body says the same obliging things . I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury , as they can be to see her . Yes , Friday or Saturday ; she can not say which , because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days . So very good of them to send her the whole way ! But they always do , you know . Oh yes , Friday or Saturday next . That is what she writes about . That is the reason of her writing out of rule , as we call it ; for , in the common course , we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday . """
Miss Bates	""" So obliging of you ! No , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon . My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months with us at least . Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you . The case is , you see , that the Campbells are going to Ireland . Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly . They had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last October , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , I was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , I declare I do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in Jane 's letter -- wrote in Mr. Dixon 's name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in Dublin , and take them back to their country seat , Baly - craig , a beautiful place , I fancy . Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from Mr. Dixon , I mean-- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter 's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon , for which I do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland ; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself . He is a most amiable , charming young man , I believe . Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland , from his account of things . """
Miss Bates	""" But where could _ you _ hear it ? """
Miss Bates	""" Where could you possibly hear it , Mr. Knightley ? For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole 's note -- no , it can not be more than five-- or at least ten -- for I had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out -- I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork -- Jane was standing in the passage -- were not you , Jane?-- for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough . So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ` Shall I go down instead ? for I think you have a little cold , and Patty has been washing the kitchen . '--`Oh ! my dear , ' said I -- well , and just then came the note . A Miss Hawkins-- that 's all I know . A Miss Hawkins of Bath . But , Mr. Knightley , how could you possibly have heard it ? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me . A Miss Hawkins-- """
Miss Bates	""" Well ! that is quite -- I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting . My dear sir , you really are too bountiful . My mother desires her very best compliments and regards , and a thousand thanks , and says you really quite oppress her . """
Miss Bates	"Woodhouse--""indeed it certainly is , so very superior to all other pork , that Emma and I can not have a greater pleasure than-- """
Miss Bates	""" It was short -- merely to announce -- but cheerful , exulting , of course . ""--"
Miss Bates	""" A new neighbour for us all , Miss Woodhouse ! """
Miss Bates	""" my mother is so pleased!--she says she can not bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress . This is great news , indeed . Jane , you have never seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him . """
Miss Bates	""" No -- I have never seen Mr. Elton , """
Miss Bates	""" is he -- is he a tall man ? """
Miss Bates	""" Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse , """
Miss Bates	""" four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs. Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man -- but'--In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries . I do not pretend to it . What is before me , I see . At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired -- Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly . She knows I would not offend for the world . How does Miss Smith do ? She seems quite recovered now . Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately ? Oh ! those dear little children . Jane , do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley . I mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative . """
Miss Bates	""" Very odd ! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand . One takes up a notion , and runs away with it . Mr. Dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ? """
Miss Bates	""" My dear , you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself-- """
Miss Bates	"near--""Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ? Go , and interfere . They have no mercy on her . """
Miss Bates	""" What was I talking of ? """
Miss Bates	""" Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible , just to thank him . I will not open the window here ; it would give you all cold ; but I can go into my mother 's room you know . I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here . Quite delightful to have you all meet so!--Our little room so honoured ! """
Miss Bates	""" So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage , """
Miss Bates	""" Why , to own the truth , """
Miss Bates	""" if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days . Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed . Jane , do n't you remember grandmama 's telling us of it when we got home ? I forget where we had been walking to-- very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls . Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of . At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware . I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not . I am not like Jane ; I wish I were . I will answer for it _ she _ never betrayed the least thing in the world . Where is she?--Oh ! just behind . Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry 's coming.-- Extraordinary dream , indeed ! """
Miss Bates	""" Oh ! very well , """
Miss Bates	""" then I need not be uneasy . ` Three things very dull indeed . ' That will just do for me , you know . I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth , sha n't I ? ( looking round with the most good - humoured dependence on every body 's assent)--Do not you all think I shall ? """
Miss Bates	""" With all my heart . I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot . Come , Jane , take my other arm . """
Miss Bates	"hearing:--""How well they suit one another!--Very lucky -- marrying as they did , upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only knew each other , I think , a few weeks in Bath ! Peculiarly lucky!-- for as to any real knowledge of a person 's disposition that Bath , or any public place , can give -- it is all nothing ; there can be no knowledge . It is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment . Short of that , it is all guess and luck-- and will generally be ill - luck . How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance , and rued it all the rest of his life ! """
Miss Bates	""" Well , my dear , I shall _ say _ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough . """
Miss Bates	""" So very kind ! """
Miss Bates	""" But you are always kind . """
Miss Bates	""" Aye , I see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte . What is to become of that?--Very true . Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.-- ` You must go , ' said she . ` You and I must part . You will have no business here.--Let it stay , however , ' said she ; ` give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back . I shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties . '-- And to this day , I do believe , she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter 's . """
Miss Bates	""" Indeed , the truth was , that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all-- Mrs. Elton , indeed , could not be denied -- and Mrs. Cole had made such a point -- and Mrs. Perry had said so much -- but , except them , Jane would really see nobody . """
Miss Bates	""" dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing . """
Miss Bates	""" This is most kind , indeed!--Miss Woodhouse , it is impossible for me to express -- I hope you will believe -- Excuse me for being so entirely without words . """
Miss Bates	""" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness.--It is impossible to say -- Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane 's prospects-- that is , I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.-- How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.-- Such a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes , indeed.-- Charming young man!--that is -- so very friendly ; I mean good Mr. Perry!-- such attention to Jane!""--And"
Miss Bates	""" He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley ; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.--Mr . E. is Knightley 's right hand . """
Miss Bates	""" Oh ! no , it is a meeting at the Crown , a regular meeting . Weston and Cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way . """
Miss Bates	""" Oh ! no , the meeting is certainly to - day , """
Miss Bates	""" Your parish there was small , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" It is very kind of you , Mr. Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us . I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Not at all , sir . It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" But you must have found it very damp and dirty . I wish you may not catch cold . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Dirty , sir ! Look at my shoes . Not a speck on them . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Well ! that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here . It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast . I wanted them to put off the wedding . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" By the bye -- I have not wished you joy . Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well . How did you all behave ? Who cried most ? """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Ah ! poor Miss Taylor ! ' Tis a sad business . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I can not possibly say ` poor Miss Taylor . ' I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" But , my dear , pray do not make any more matches ; they are silly things , and break up one 's family circle grievously . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him . But if you want to shew him any attention , my dear , ask him to come and dine with us some day . That will be a much better thing . I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Ah , poor Miss Taylor ! She would be very glad to stay . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" It is very pretty , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" So prettily done ! Just as your drawings always are , my dear . I do not know any body who draws so well as you do . The only thing I do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" But it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them ! but he hoped he should in time . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Kitty , a fair but frozen maid . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Aye , that 's very just , indeed , that 's very properly said . Very true . ` Woman , lovely woman . ' It is such a pretty charade , my dear , that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written so prettily , but you , Emma . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Ah ! it is no difficulty to see who you take after ! Your dear mother was so clever at all those things ! If I had but her memory ! But I can remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention ; I can only recollect the first stanza ; and there are several ."
Mr. Woodhouse	""" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does . I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . She and the children might stay very well . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Ah ! papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish , and I do not think you ever will . Isabella can not bear to stay behind her husband . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Ah , my dear , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" poor Miss Taylor -- It is a grievous business . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Pretty well , my dear -- I hope -- pretty well.--I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Oh ! no -- none in the least . I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life-- never looking so well . Papa is only speaking his own regret . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Very much to the honour of both , """
Mr. Woodhouse	"hesitated.--""Not near so often , my dear , as I could wish . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Oh ! papa , we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married . Either in the morning or evening of every day , excepting one , have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston , and generally both , either at Randalls or here -- and as you may suppose , Isabella , most frequently here . They are very , very kind in their visits . Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself . Papa , if you speak in that melancholy way , you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all . Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed , but every body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated -- which is the exact truth . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not , papa.-- You quite forget poor Mr. Weston . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" My poor dear Isabella , """
Mr. Woodhouse	"children--""How long it is , how terribly long since you were here ! And how tired you must be after your journey ! You must go to bed early , my dear -- and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together . My dear Emma , suppose we all have a little gruel . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Our little friend Harriet Smith , however , is just such another pretty kind of young person . You will like Harriet . Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Ah ! """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Ah ! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End . It does not bear talking of . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn , instead of coming here . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" But why should you be sorry , sir?--I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" And , moreover , if you must go to the sea , it had better not have been to South End . South End is an unhealthy place . Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I know there is such an idea with many people , but indeed it is quite a mistake , sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there , never found the least inconvenience from the mud ; and Mr. Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy ; and I am sure he may be depended on , for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air , and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" You should have gone to Cromer , my dear , if you went anywhere.-- Perry was a week at Cromer once , and he holds it to be the best of all the sea - bathing places . A fine open sea , he says , and very pure air . And , by what I understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable . You should have consulted Perry . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" But , my dear sir , the difference of the journey;--only consider how great it would have been.--An hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Ah ! my dear , as Perry says , where health is at stake , nothing else should be considered ; and if one is to travel , there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all , better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air . This is just what Perry said . It seemed to him a very ill - judged measure . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" A man , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him . He must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; I could not do such a thing . It is the greatest absurdity -- Actually snowing at this moment!-- The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people 's not staying comfortably at home when they can ! If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it;--and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man 's house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow . Going in dismal weather , to return probably in worse;--four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle , shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir . Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I admired your resolution very much , sir , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" in venturing out in such weather , for of course you saw there would be snow very soon . Every body must have seen the snow coming on . I admired your spirit ; and I dare say we shall get home very well . Another hour or two 's snow can hardly make the road impassable ; and we are two carriages ; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand . I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" What is to be done , my dear Emma?--what is to be done ? """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I hope every body had a pleasant evening , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I had . Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me . Miss Bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick . However , she is very agreeable , and Mrs. Bates too , in a different way . I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed . She must have found the evening agreeable , Mr. Knightley , because she had Emma . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined ! a great pity indeed ! and I have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon-- Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate -- Hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork -- I think we had better send the leg-- do not you think so , my dear ? """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" My dear papa , I sent the whole hind - quarter . I knew you would wish it . There will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" That 's right , my dear , very right . I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way . They must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , I do not consider it unwholesome . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" He is very young to settle , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" He had better not be in a hurry . He seemed to me very well off as he was . We were always glad to see him at Hartfield . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Very true , Miss Woodhouse , so she will . He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry . Miss Hawkins,--I dare say , an excellent young woman . His extreme attention to my mother-- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know -- it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick . Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf . He fancied bathing might be good for it -- the warm bath-- but she says it did him no lasting benefit . Colonel Campbell , you know , is quite our angel . And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him . It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do . Now , here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins ; and there are the Coles , such very good people ; and the Perrys -- I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry . I say , sir , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I think there are few places with such society as Highbury . I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork-- a roast loin of pork-- """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ? """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady . She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life . They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard . He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her . James could take the note . But first of all , there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ? """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" And no great harm if it does , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" The sooner every party breaks up , the better . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" No , upon no account in the world , Mr. Weston ; I am much obliged to you for reminding me . I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain . I know what worthy people they are . Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor . You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- Mr. Cole is very bilious . No , I would not be the means of giving them any pain . My dear Emma , we must consider this . I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish . You will not regard being tired . You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Oh ! no , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" it would be the extreme of imprudence . I could not bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong . She would catch a dreadful cold . So would poor little Harriet . So you would all . Mrs. Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing . Pray do not let them talk of it . That young man ( speaking lower ) is very thoughtless . Do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing . He has been opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping them open very inconsiderately . He does not think of the draught . I do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing ! """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Sir , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character . Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill . But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father 's house . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Open the windows!--but surely , Mr. Churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls . Nobody could be so imprudent ! I never heard of such a thing . Dancing with open windows!--I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs. Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Have you indeed , sir?--Bless me ! I never could have supposed it . But I live out of the world , and am often astonished at what I hear . However , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration . One can not resolve upon them in a hurry . If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I am very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain . Young ladies should take care of themselves.-- Young ladies are delicate plants . They should take care of their health and their complexion . My dear , did you change your stockings ? """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Yes , sir , I did indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" My dear Miss Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for.-- I hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well . They are some of my very old friends . I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour . You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure . My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Isabella and Emma both write beautifully , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" and always did . And so does poor Mrs. Weston""--with"
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Must I go first ? I really am ashamed of always leading the way . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" poor little boys , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens . He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day . He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton , and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma 's , and Harriet 's going there some very fine morning . He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them-- very kind and sensible -- much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining out . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Is not she looking well ? """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston doat upon her . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" The shame , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" is all mine , or ought to be . But is it possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late . Early , I know , you had none . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I never had the smallest , I assure you . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" That appears quite wonderful . I was once very near -- and I wish I had-- it would have been better . But though I was always doing wrong things , they were very bad wrong things , and such as did me no service.-- It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing . """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" I have some hope , """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" of my uncle 's being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her . When the Campbells are returned , we shall meet them in London , and continue there , I trust , till we may carry her northward.--But now , I am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard , Miss Woodhouse?-- Till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation . Do not you pity me ? """
Mr. Woodhouse	""" She should always send for Perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment . She could not be too soon alarmed , nor send for Perry too often . It was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it . """
Isabella Knightley	""" poor Isabella """
Isabella Knightley	""" And do you see her , sir , tolerably often ? """
Isabella Knightley	""" Oh , Mrs. Churchill ; every body knows Mrs. Churchill , """
Isabella Knightley	""" and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion . To be constantly living with an ill - tempered person , must be dreadful . It is what we happily have never known any thing of ; but it must be a life of misery . What a blessing , that she never had any children ! Poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them ! """
Isabella Knightley	""" How very pleasing and proper of him ! """
Isabella Knightley	""" I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man . But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father ! There is something so shocking in a child 's being taken away from his parents and natural home ! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with him . To give up one 's child ! I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else . """
Mrs. Bates	""" I am afraid Jane is not very well , """
Mrs. Bates	""" but I do not know ; they _ tell _ me she is well . I dare say my daughter will be here presently , Miss Woodhouse . I hope you find a chair . I wish Hetty had not gone . I am very little able -- Have you a chair , ma'am ? Do you sit where you like ? I am sure she will be here presently . """
Mrs. Bates	""" We can finish this some other time , you know . You and I shall not want opportunities . And , in fact , you have heard all the essential already . I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology , and is not offended . You see how delightfully she writes . Oh ! she is a sweet creature ! You would have doated on her , had you gone.--But not a word more . Let us be discreet-- quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines-- I forget the poem at this moment :"
Mrs. Bates	""" We do not say a word of any _ assistance _ that Perry might have ; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh ! no ; Perry shall have all the credit . """
Mrs. Bates	""" I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , """
Mrs. Bates	""" since the party to Box Hill . Very pleasant party . But yet I think there was something wanting . Things did not seem -- that is , there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least , but I might be mistaken . However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again . What say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to Box Hill again , while the fine weather lasts?-- It must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _ one _ exception . """
Mrs. Cole	""" One can suppose nothing else , """
Mrs. Cole	""" and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt . But Jane , it seems , had a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it . She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present . They might chuse to surprize her . """
Mrs. Cole	""" Why do you smile ? """
