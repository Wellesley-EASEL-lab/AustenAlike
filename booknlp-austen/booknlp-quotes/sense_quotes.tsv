Elinor Dashwood	""" I think you will like him , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" when you know more of him . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No taste for drawing ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" why should you think so ? He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well . He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I hope , Marianne , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" you do not consider him as deficient in general taste . Indeed , I think I may say that you can not , for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial , and if THAT were your opinion , I am sure you could never be civil to him . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am sure , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that . I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Of his sense and his goodness , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" no one can , I think , be in doubt , who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation . The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well - informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so . What say you , Marianne ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I shall very soon think him handsome , Elinor , if I do not now . When you tell me to love him as a brother , I shall no more see imperfection in his face , than I now do in his heart . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I do not attempt to deny , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" that I think very highly of him -- that I greatly esteem , that I like him . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Excuse me , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" and be assured that I meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings . Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion -- the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . But farther than this you must not believe . I am by no means assured of his regard for me . There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . In my heart I feel little -- scarcely any doubt of his preference . But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Devonshire ! Are you , indeed , going there ? So far from hence ! And to what part of it ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" It is but a cottage , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" but I hope to see many of my friends in it . A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Infirmity ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" do you call Colonel Brandon infirm ? I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Perhaps , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" thirty - five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together . But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , I should not think Colonel Brandon 's being thirty - five any objection to his marrying HER . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" It would be impossible , I know , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty - five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her . But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber , merely because he chanced to complain yesterday ( a very cold damp day ) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" But who is he ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Where does he come from ? Has he a house at Allenham ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well , Marianne , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well . You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby 's opinion in almost every matter of importance . You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott ; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought , and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper . But how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ? You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic . Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask . ""--"
Elinor Dashwood	""" Do not boast of it , however , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" for it is injustice in both of you . He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother . If their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" My protege , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me . Yes , Marianne , even in a man between thirty and forty . He has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind . I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" He WOULD have told me so , I doubt not , had I made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour . But why should you dislike him ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid . I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , I believe , possessing an amiable heart . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I can not agree with you there , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne 's , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You are mistaken , Elinor , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" in supposing I know very little of Willoughby . I have not known him long indeed , but I am much better acquainted with him , than I am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;-- it is disposition alone . Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from Willoughby . Of John I know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You have said so , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" almost every day since they first met on High - church Down ; and they had not known each other a week , I believe , before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Take care , Margaret . It may be only the hair of some great uncle of HIS . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am afraid , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" But , my dear Marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes , I suppose , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I flatter myself , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase , you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I want no proof of their affection , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" but of their engagement I do . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject , by either of them . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I confess , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" that every circumstance except ONE is in favour of their engagement ; but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject , and with me it almost outweighs every other . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , I can not think that . He must and does love her I am sure . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You must remember , my dear mother , that I have never considered this matter as certain . I have had my doubts , I confess ; but they are fainter than they were , and they may soon be entirely done away . If we find they correspond , every fear of mine will be removed . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I hope not , I believe not , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I love Willoughby , sincerely love him ; and suspicion of his integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me . It has been involuntary , and I will not encourage it . I was startled , I confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality . But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed . He had just parted from my sister , had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction ; and if he felt obliged , from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith , to resist the temptation of returning here soon , and yet aware that by declining your invitation , by saying that he was going away for some time , he should seem to act an ungenerous , a suspicious part by our family , be might well be embarrassed and disturbed . In such a case , a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think , as well as more consistent with his general character;--but I will not raise objections against any one 's conduct on so illiberal a foundation , as a difference in judgment from myself , or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Why do you not ask Marianne at once , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby ? From you , her mother , and so kind , so indulgent a mother , the question could not give offence . It would be the natural result of your affection for her . She used to be all unreserve , and to you more especially . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I would not ask such a question for the world . Supposing it possible that they are not engaged , what distress would not such an enquiry inflict ! At any rate it would be most ungenerous . I should never deserve her confidence again , after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one . I know Marianne 's heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible . I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Indeed , Marianne , I think you are mistaken . It is not Willoughby . The person is not tall enough for him , and has not his air . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Have you been lately in Sussex ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Dear , dear Norland , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year . The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" It is not every one , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" who has your passion for dead leaves . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Grandeur has but little , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" but wealth has much to do with it . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Perhaps , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" we may come to the same point . YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year ; not more than THAT . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" TWO thousand a year ! ONE is my wealth ! I guessed how it would end . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Hunters ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" We are all unanimous in that wish , I suppose , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" in spite of the insufficiency of wealth . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You must begin your improvements on this house , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" and your difficulties will soon vanish . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" she is not at all altered . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Nor do I think it a part of Marianne 's , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest , very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated . Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves , and very frequently by what other people say of them , without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , Marianne , never . My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding . All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour . You must not confound my meaning . I am guilty , I confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Quite the contrary , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ? Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I suspect , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another . Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses . He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" by these frequent invitations , than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago . The alteration is not in them , if their parties are grown tedious and dull . We must look for the change elsewhere . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Certainly , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" he seems very agreeable . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well -- I am so glad you do . I thought you would , he is so pleasant ; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you , and you ca n't think how disappointed he will be if you do n't come to Cleveland.--I ca n't imagine why you should object to it . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Palmer;--""Not that I ever spoke to him , indeed ; but I have seen him for ever in town . Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was at Allenham . Mama saw him here once before;-- but I was with my uncle at Weymouth . However , I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire , if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together . He is very little at Combe , I believe ; but if he were ever so much there , I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him , for he is in the opposition , you know , and besides it is such a way off . I know why you inquire about him , very well ; your sister is to marry him . I am monstrous glad of it , for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Upon my word , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" you know much more of the matter than I do , if you have any reason to expect such a match . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Do n't pretend to deny it , because you know it is what every body talks of . I assure you I heard of it in my way through town . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" My dear Mrs. Palmer ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in Bond - street , just before we left town , and he told me of it directly . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You surprise me very much . Colonel Brandon tell you of it ! Surely you must be mistaken . To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" But I do assure you it was so , for all that , and I will tell you how it happened . When we met him , he turned back and walked with us ; and so we began talking of my brother and sister , and one thing and another , and I said to him , ' So , Colonel , there is a new family come to Barton cottage , I hear , and mama sends me word they are very pretty , and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna . Is it true , pray ? for of course you must know , as you have been in Devonshire so lately . ' """
Elinor Dashwood	""" And what did the Colonel say ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Oh -- he did not say much ; but he looked as if he knew it to be true , so from that moment I set it down as certain . It will be quite delightful , I declare ! When is it to take place ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Mr. Brandon was very well I hope ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Oh ! yes , quite well ; and so full of your praises , he did nothing but say fine things of you . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am flattered by his commendation . He seems an excellent man ; and I think him uncommonly pleasing . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" So do I.--He is such a charming man , that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull . Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was , for he hardly ever falls in love with any body . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Oh ! yes , extremely well ; that is , I do not believe many people are acquainted with him , because Combe Magna is so far off ; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you . Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes , and so you may tell your sister . She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her . However , I do n't think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am so glad we are got acquainted at last , """
Elinor Dashwood	"Charlotte.--""And now I hope we shall always be great friends . You ca n't think how much I longed to see you ! It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage ! Nothing can be like it , to be sure ! And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married ! I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna . It is a sweet place , by all accounts . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon , have not you ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I should guess so , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" from what I have witnessed this morning . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I confess , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I think every one MUST admire it , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" who ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Upon my word , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I can not tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word . But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" ' Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" And who was this uncle ? Where did he live ? How came they acquainted ? """
Elinor Dashwood	"cottage--""but pray , are you personally acquainted with your sister - in - law 's mother , Mrs. Ferrars ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am sorry I do NOT , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her . But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family , and therefore I am a little surprised , I confess , at so serious an inquiry into her character . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Good heavens ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" what do you mean ? Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars ? Can you be ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" May I ask if your engagement is of long standing ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" We have been engaged these four years . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Four years ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I did not know , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" that you were even acquainted till the other day . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Our acquaintance , however , is of many years date . He was under my uncle 's care , you know , a considerable while . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Your uncle ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes ; Mr. Pratt . Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I think I have , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" He was four years with my uncle , who lives at Longstaple , near Plymouth . It was there our acquaintance begun , for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle , and it was there our engagement was formed , though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil ; but he was almost always with us afterwards . I was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but I was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so well as me , Miss Dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Certainly , """
Elinor Dashwood	"falsehood--""Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me , that really -- I beg your pardon ; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name . We can not mean the same Mr. Ferrars . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" It is strange , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" that I should never have heard him even mention your name . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You are quite in the right , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I certainly did not seek your confidence , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on . Your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication . You must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" in telling you all this . I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance . Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward 's mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask . Anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for I am in constant fear of her betraying me . She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day , when Edward 's name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all . You ca n't think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether . I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward 's sake these last four years . Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom -- we can hardly meet above twice a - year . I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Pardon me , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" but I can give you no advice under such circumstances . Your own judgment must direct you . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Did he come from your uncle 's , then , when he visited us ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" We did , indeed , particularly so when he first arrived . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I did , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma'am , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" and I do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano - forte I ever heard . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Perhaps , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" if I should happen to cut out , I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele , in rolling her papers for her ; and there is so much still to be done to the basket , that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly , to finish it this evening . I should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with , if I felt no desire for its continuance , or no farther curiosity on its subject . I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Offended me ! How could you suppose so ? Believe me , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea . Could you have a motive for the trust , that was not honourable and flattering to me ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" All this , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" But what , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" are your views ? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars 's death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" And for your own sake too , or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Not at all -- I never saw him ; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother -- silly and a great coxcomb . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Oh , they are talking of their favourite beaux , I dare say . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I should always be happy , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ? He is brother to Mrs. John Dashwood -- THAT must be recommendation enough to her husband . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" on such a subject I certainly will not . You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one . It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am writing home , Marianne , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" had not you better defer your letter for a day or two ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Has no letter been left here for me since we went out ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Are you quite sure of it ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Are you certain that no servant , no porter has left any letter or note ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" How very odd ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" How odd , indeed ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" If she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him , as she did ; she would have written to Combe Magna ; and if he is in town , how odd that he should neither come nor write ! Oh ! my dear mother , you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young , a man so little known , to be carried on in so doubtful , so mysterious a manner ! I long to inquire ; and how will MY interference be borne . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" At any rate , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Ay , my dear , I 'll warrant you we do . Mary always has her own way . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" And now , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" she will write to Combe by this day 's post . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Depend upon it , he will call again tomorrow . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You are expecting a letter , then ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Me ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" indeed , Marianne , I have nothing to tell . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Did you ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" It can not be generally known , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" for her own family do not know it . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Pray , pray be composed , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" and do not betray what you feel to every body present . Perhaps he has not observed you yet . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Marianne , may I ask- ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , Elinor , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" ask nothing ; you will soon know all . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature . I hope , from the bottom of my heart , he wo n't keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn . Pray , when are they to be married ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" And have you really , Ma'am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister 's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby ? I thought it had been only a joke , but so serious a question seems to imply more ; and I must beg , therefore , that you will not deceive yourself any longer . I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Indeed , Ma'am , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" you are mistaken . Indeed , you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report , and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Poor Elinor ! how unhappy I make you ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Exert yourself , dear Marianne , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" if you would not kill yourself and all who love you . Think of your mother ; think of her misery while YOU suffer : for her sake you must exert yourself . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Do you call ME happy , Marianne ? Ah ! if you knew!--And can you believe me to be so , while I see you so wretched ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Many , many circumstances , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I can believe it , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" but unfortunately he did not feel the same . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" It is too much ! Oh , Willoughby , Willoughby , could this be yours ! Cruel , cruel -- nothing can acquit you . Elinor , nothing can . Whatever he might have heard against me-- ought he not to have suspended his belief ? ought he not to have told me of it , to have given me the power of clearing myself ? ' The lock of hair , ( repeating it from the letter , ) which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable . Willoughby , where was your heart when you wrote those words ? Oh , barbarously insolent!--Elinor , can he be justified ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , Marianne , in no possible way . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" And yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been?--how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh ! no one , no one -- he talked to me only of myself . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Elinor , I must go home . I must go and comfort mama . Can not we be gone to - morrow ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" To - morrow , Marianne ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , why should I stay here ? I came only for Willoughby 's sake -- and now who cares for me ? Who regards me ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" It would be impossible to go to - morrow . We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility ; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but I can not stay here long , I can not stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people . The Middletons and Palmers -- how am I to bear their pity ? The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton ! Oh , what would HE say to that ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" no , she would go down ; she could bear it very well , and the bustle about her would be less . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Ay , if we can do THAT , Ma'am , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I will leave you , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" if you will go to bed . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Dear Ma'am , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" how good you are ! But I have just left Marianne in bed , and , I hope , almost asleep ; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest , if you will give me leave , I will drink the wine myself . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You mean , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Mr. Willoughby 's marriage with Miss Grey . Yes , we DO know it all . This seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us . Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable ! Where did you hear it ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" It is . But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds ? In that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Her sufferings have been very severe . I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short . It has been , it is a most cruel affliction . Till yesterday , I believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps -- but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her . He has been very deceitful ! and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Who can this be ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" So early too ! I thought we HAD been safe . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" He will not come in , as Mrs. Jennings is from home . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I understand you , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby , that will open his character farther . Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne . MY gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end , and HERS must be gained by it in time . Pray , pray let me hear it . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation-- ( it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park -- it was the evening of a dance -- in which I alluded to a lady I had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister Marianne . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Indeed , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned to England . My first care , when I DID arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy . I could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin . Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person . He imagined , and calmly could he imagine it , that her extravagance , and consequent distress , had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief . At last , however , and after I had been six months in England , I DID find her . Regard for a former servant of my own , who had since fallen into misfortune , carried me to visit him in a spunging - house , where he was confined for debt ; and there , the same house , under a similar confinement , was my unfortunate sister . So altered -- so faded -- worn down by acute suffering of every kind ! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom I had once doted . What I endured in so beholding her -- but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it -- I have pained you too much already . That she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was -- yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort . Life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given . I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life : I was with her in her last moments . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Good heavens ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" could it be -- could Willoughby!""--"
Elinor Dashwood	""" This is beyond every thing ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" His character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both . Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it . To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister -- but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister 's influence might yet reclaim him . But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her . Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self - reproach , which must attend her through life . Surely this comparison must have its use with her . She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing . They proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace . On the contrary , every friend must be made still more her friend by them . Concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment . Use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what I have told you . You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I have been more pained , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier . Have you , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" What ? have you met him to-- """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I could meet him no other way . Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct . We returned unwounded , and the meeting , therefore , never got abroad . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here STILL , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" But I always thought I SHOULD . I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you TOLD me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a MONTH . But I thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point . It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came . And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone . I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Indeed I believe you , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Is Mr. Edward Ferrars , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" going to be married ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Certainly , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" and assisted by her liberality , I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Where is the green - house to be ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was not the case""--"
Elinor Dashwood	"quickly--""but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing . You sha n't talk me out of my satisfaction . I am sure it will all end well , and there will be no difficulties at all , to what I used to think . Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister . They are both delightful women , indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations , no space in a cottage ; but this is all a mistake . I was last month at my friend Elliott 's , near Dartford . Lady Elliott wished to give a dance . ' But how can it be done ? ' said she ; ' my dear Ferrars , do tell me how it is to be managed . There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple , and where can the supper be ? ' I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it , so I said , ' My dear Lady Elliott , do not be uneasy . The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease ; card - tables may be placed in the drawing - room ; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments ; and let the supper be set out in the saloon . ' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought . We measured the dining - room , and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple , and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan . So that , in fact , you see , if people do but know how to set about it , every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Lord ! my dear Miss Dashwood ! have you heard the news ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Something so strange ! But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr. Palmer 's , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child . She was sure it was very ill -- it cried , and fretted , and was all over pimples . So I looked at it directly , and , ' Lord ! my dear , ' says I , ' it is nothing in the world , but the red gum-- ' and nurse said just the same . But Charlotte , she would not be satisfied , so Mr. Donavan was sent for ; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street , so he stepped over directly , and as soon as ever he saw the child , be said just as we did , that it was nothing in the world but the red gum , and then Charlotte was easy . And so , just as he was going away again , it came into my head , I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it , but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news . So upon that , he smirked , and simpered , and looked grave , and seemed to know something or other , and at last he said in a whisper , ' For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister 's indisposition , I think it advisable to say , that I believe there is no great reason for alarm ; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will do very well . ' """
Elinor Dashwood	""" That is exactly what I said , my dear . ' Lord ! ' says I , ' is Mrs. Dashwood ill ? ' So then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all I can learn , seems to be this . Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ) , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There 's for you , my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it out directly . Well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;-- till this very morning , poor Nancy , who , you know , is a well - meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out . ' Lord ! ' thinks she to herself , ' they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ; ' and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet - work , little suspecting what was to come -- for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord 's daughter or other , I forget who . So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride . She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother 's ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing - room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . So up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for Lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on . Poor soul ! I pity HER . And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit . Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes . THEN she fell into hysterics again , and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan , and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar . The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad . I declare , I have no patience with your sister ; and I hope , with all my heart , it will be a match in spite of her . Lord ! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it ! To have his love used so scornfully ! for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may . I should not wonder , if he was to be in the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same . He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care . I have no pity for either of them . I have no notion of people 's making such a to - do about money and greatness . There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a - year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . Lord ! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours -- or a little bigger -- with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" and once or twice I have attempted it;-- but without betraying my trust , I never could have convinced you . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes . But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others was dear to me , I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt . Now , I can think and speak of it with little emotion . I would not have you suffer on my account ; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself . I have many things to support me . I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own , I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther . I acquit Edward of essential misconduct . I wish him very happy ; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty , that though now he may harbour some regret , in the end he must become so . Lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--And after all , Marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one 's happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant -- it is not fit -- it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edward will marry Lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER.""--"
Elinor Dashwood	""" I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For four months , Marianne , I have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as I thought , with triumph.-- This person 's suspicions , therefore , I have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling -- surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW . The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that I have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;-- they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No , Marianne.--THEN , if I had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely -- not even what I owed to my dearest friends -- from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy . ""--"
Elinor Dashwood	"arm--""for I wanted to see you of all things in the world . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it . Is she angry ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Not at all , I believe , with you . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" That is a good thing . And Lady Middleton , is SHE angry ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I can not suppose it possible that she should . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before , I assure you , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" you were all in the same room together , were not you ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" How ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door ? I am sorry I did not know it before ; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself . How could you behave so unfairly by your sister ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Edward talks of going to Oxford soon , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" but now he is lodging at No . -- , Pall Mall . What an ill - natured woman his mother is , an't she ? And your brother and sister were not very kind ! However , I sha n't say anything against them to YOU ; and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot , which was more than I looked for . And for my part , I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before ; but , however , nothing was said about them , and I took care to keep mine out of sight . Edward have got some business at Oxford , he says ; so he must go there for a time ; and after THAT , as soon as he can light upon a Bishop , he will be ordained . I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious ! ( giggling as she spoke ) I 'd lay my life I know what my cousins will say , when they hear of it . They will tell me I should write to the Doctor , to get Edward the curacy of his new living . I know they will ; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.-- ' La ! ' I shall say directly , ' I wonder how you could think of such a thing ? I write to the Doctor , indeed ! ' """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst . You have got your answer ready . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Bartlett 's Building , March ."
Elinor Dashwood	""" I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her ; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward , after all the troubles we have went through lately , therefore will make no more apologies , but proceed to say that , thank God ! though we have suffered dreadfully , we are both quite well now , and as happy as we must always be in one another 's love . We have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember , as will Edward too , who I have told of it . I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother 's anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs. Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr. Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us.--Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs. Jennings wo n't think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ' twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne ,"
Elinor Dashwood	""" I am , & c. """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Very well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye , that was quite proper to let him be off if he would . That was just like Lucy.--Poor soul ! I wish I COULD get him a living , with all my heart.--She calls me dear Mrs. Jennings , you see . She is a good - hearted girl as ever lived.--Very well upon my word . That sentence is very prettily turned . Yes , yes , I will go and see her , sure enough . How attentive she is , to think of every body!--Thank you , my dear , for shewing it me . It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw , and does Lucy 's head and heart great credit . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You forget , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" that its situation is not ... that it is not in the neighbourhood of ... """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty,""--he"
Elinor Dashwood	"feeling,--""of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to . I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street , and am much pleased with him . He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , I wish it still more . I understand that he intends to take orders . Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford , now just vacant , as I am informed by this day 's post , is his , if he think it worth his acceptance -- but THAT , perhaps , so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now , it may be nonsense to appear to doubt ; I only wish it were more valuable.-- It is a rectory , but a small one ; the late incumbent , I believe , did not make more than 200 L per annum , and though it is certainly capable of improvement , I fear , not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income . Such as it is , however , my pleasure in presenting him to it , will be very great . Pray assure him of it . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" The smallness of the house , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I can not imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Thank you , ma'am , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" It is a matter of great joy to me ; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly . There are not many men who would act as he has done . Few people who have so compassionate a heart ! I never was more astonished in my life . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel 's general benevolence ; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur . """
Elinor Dashwood	"Jennings--""Oh ! as to that , when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing , somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity . Well , my dear , I wish you joy of it again and again ; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world , I think I shall soon know where to look for them . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Aye , my dear , that I do , indeed . And as to the house being a bad one , I do not know what the Colonel would be at , for it is as good a one as ever I saw . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" He spoke of its being out of repair . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well , and whose fault is that ? why do n't he repair it?-- who should do it but himself ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well , my dear , I must be gone before I have had half my talk out . But , however , we may have it all over in the evening ; for we shall be quite alone . I do not ask you to go with me , for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company ; and besides , you must long to tell your sister all about it . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Certainly , ma'am , I shall tell Marianne of it ; but I shall not mention it at present to any body else . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , ma'am , not even Lucy if you please . One day 's delay will not be very material ; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars , I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else . I shall do THAT directly . It is of importance that no time should be lost with him , for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man , that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" And so YOU are forced to do it . Well THAT is an odd kind of delicacy ! However , I will not disturb you ( seeing her preparing to write . ) You know your own concerns best . So goodby , my dear . I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I have just been thinking of Betty 's sister , my dear . I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress . But whether she would do for a lady 's maid , I am sure I ca n't tell . She is an excellent housemaid , and works very well at her needle . However , you will think of all that at your leisure . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Certainly , ma'am , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You would not have gone , however , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" without receiving our good wishes , even if we had not been able to give them in person . Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said . I have something of consequence to inform you of , which I was on the point of communicating by paper . I am charged with a most agreeable office ( breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke . ) Colonel Brandon , who was here only ten minutes ago , has desired me to say , that understanding you mean to take orders , he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant , and only wishes it were more valuable . Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well - judging a friend , and to join in his wish that the living -- it is about two hundred a - year -- were much more considerable , and such as might better enable you to -- as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself -- such , in short , as might establish all your views of happiness .

Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed -- for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you -- a concern which I am sure Marianne , myself , and all your friends , must share ; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character , and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You are very much mistaken . I do assure you that you owe it entirely , at least almost entirely , to your own merit , and Colonel Brandon 's discernment of it . I have had no hand in it . I did not even know , till I understood his design , that the living was vacant ; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift . As a friend of mine , of my family , he may , perhaps -- indeed I know he HAS , still greater pleasure in bestowing it ; but , upon my word , you owe nothing to my solicitation . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Indeed , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house , ) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I must hurry away then , to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU ; to assure him that he has made me a very -- an exceedingly happy man . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" When I see him again , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I shall see him the husband of Lucy . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well , my dear , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I sent you up to the young man . Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty -- You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well , and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon that . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Really , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I know so little of these kind of forms , that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time , or the preparation necessary ; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" My dear ma'am , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" what can you be thinking of?-- Why , Colonel Brandon 's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living 's being enough to allow them to marry . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Fanny is in her own room , I suppose , """
Elinor Dashwood	"he:--""I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it , indeed . NOW especially there can not be -- but however , you and Marianne were always great favourites.--Why would not Marianne come?""--"
Elinor Dashwood	""" It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" About two hundred a year . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" It is truly astonishing!""--he"
Elinor Dashwood	"said--""what could be the Colonel 's motive ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" A very simple one -- to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well , well ; whatever Colonel Brandon may be , Edward is a very lucky man.--You will not mention the matter to Fanny , however , for though I have broke it to her , and she bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear it much talked of . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , sir , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I shall NOT stay . Your business can not be with ME . The servants , I suppose , forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" With me!""--in"
Elinor Dashwood	""" Sit down , and I will be both . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Pray be quick , sir,""--said"
Elinor Dashwood	""" I have no time to spare . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Mr. Willoughby , I advise you at present to return to Combe -- I am not at leisure to remain with you longer.-- Whatever your business may be with me , will it be better recollected and explained to - morrow . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Mr. Willoughby , you OUGHT to feel , and I certainly DO -- that after what has passed -- your coming here in this manner , and forcing yourself upon my notice , requires a very particular excuse.--What is it , that you mean by it?""--"
Elinor Dashwood	"energy--""if I can , to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW . I mean to offer some kind of explanation , some kind of apology , for the past ; to open my whole heart to you , and by convincing you , that though I have been always a blockhead , I have not been always a rascal , to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma -- from your sister . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Is this the real reason of your coming ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" If that is all , you may be satisfied already,-- for Marianne DOES -- she has LONG forgiven you . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You did then , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" believe yourself at one time attached to her ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I have , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I have heard it all . And how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business , I confess is beyond my comprehension . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Your indifference , however , towards that unfortunate girl -- I must say it , unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be -- your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her . Do not think yourself excused by any weakness , any natural defect of understanding on her side , in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours . You must have known , that while you were enjoying yourself in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes , always gay , always happy , she was reduced to the extremest indigence . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well , sir , and what said Mrs. Smith ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Why did you call , Mr. Willoughby ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" a note would have answered every purpose.-- Why was it necessary to call ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well , sir , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" and this is all ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , I saw every note that passed . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" This is not right , Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that you are married . Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Marianne 's note , by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse . I say awakened , because time and London , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and I had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me ; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , ' I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married . '-- But this note made me know myself better . I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that I was using her infamously . But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me . To retreat was impossible . All that I had to do , was to avoid you both . I sent no answer to Marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street;--but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , I watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Watched us out of the house ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Even so . You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you , how often I was on the point of falling in with you . I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight , as the carriage drove by . Lodging as I did in Bond Street , there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you ; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side , a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight , could have separated us so long . I avoided the Middletons as much as possible , as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common . Not aware of their being in town , however , I blundered on Sir John , I believe , the first day of his coming , and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings 's . He asked me to a party , a dance at his house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there , I should have felt it too certain a thing , to trust myself near him . The next morning brought another short note from Marianne-- still affectionate , open , artless , confiding -- everything that could make MY conduct most hateful . I could not answer it . I tried -- but could not frame a sentence . But I thought of her , I believe , every moment of the day . If you CAN pity me , Miss Dashwood , pity my situation as it was THEN . With my head and heart full of your sister , I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those three or four weeks were worse than all . Well , at last , as I need not tell you , you were forced on me ; and what a sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!-- Marianne , beautiful as an angel on one side , calling me Willoughby in such a tone!--Oh , God!--holding out her hand to me , asking me for an explanation , with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and Sophia , jealous as the devil on the other hand , looking all that was -- Well , it does not signify ; it is over now.-- Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could ; but not before I had seen Marianne 's sweet face as white as death.--THAT was the last , last look I ever had of her;-- the last manner in which she appeared to me . It was a horrid sight!--yet when I thought of her to - day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world . She was before me , constantly before me , as I travelled , in the same look and hue . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well , let me make haste and be gone . Your sister is certainly better , certainly out of danger ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" We are assured of it . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Your poor mother , too!--doting on Marianne . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" But the letter , Mr. Willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to say about that ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , yes , THAT in particular . Your sister wrote to me again , you know , the very next morning . You saw what she said . I was breakfasting at the Ellisons,--and her letter , with some others , was brought to me there from my lodgings . It happened to catch Sophia 's eye before it caught mine -- and its size , the elegance of the paper , the hand - writing altogether , immediately gave her a suspicion . Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire , and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was , and made her more jealous than ever . Affecting that air of playfulness , therefore , which is delightful in a woman one loves , she opened the letter directly , and read its contents . She was well paid for her impudence . She read what made her wretched . Her wretchedness I could have borne , but her passion -- her malice -- At all events it must be appeased . And , in short -- what do you think of my wife 's style of letter - writing?--delicate -- tender-- truly feminine -- was it not ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Your wife!--The letter was in your own hand - writing . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to . The original was all her own -- her own happy thoughts and gentle diction . But what could I do!--we were engaged , every thing in preparation , the day almost fixed -- But I am talking like a fool . Preparation!--day!--In honest words , her money was necessary to me , and in a situation like mine , any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture . And after all , what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends , in what language my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end . My business was to declare myself a scoundrel , and whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.-- ' I am ruined for ever in their opinion-- ' said I to myself--'I am shut out for ever from their society , they already think me an unprincipled fellow , this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one . ' Such were my reasonings , as , in a sort of desperate carelessness , I copied my wife 's words , and parted with the last relics of Marianne . Her three notes -- unluckily they were all in my pocketbook , or I should have denied their existence , and hoarded them for ever -- I was forced to put them up , and could not even kiss them . And the lock of hair -- that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket - book , which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear lock -- all , every memento was torn from me . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You are very wrong , Mr. Willoughby , very blamable , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" you ought not to speak in this way , either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister . You had made your own choice . It was not forced on you . Your wife has a claim to your politeness , to your respect , at least . She must be attached to you , or she would not have married you . To treat her with unkindness , to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne -- nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , you have certainly removed something -- a little.-- You have proved yourself , on the whole , less faulty than I had believed you . You have proved your heart less wicked , much less wicked . But I hardly know -- the misery that you have inflicted -- I hardly know what could have made it worse . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification . But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard of her illness . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Well,""--he"
Elinor Dashwood	"replied--""once more good bye . I shall now go away and live in dread of one event . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" What do you mean ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Your sister 's marriage . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You are very wrong . She can never be more lost to you than she is now . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" But she will be gained by some one else . And if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , I could least bear -- but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive . Good bye,--God bless you ! """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Colonel Brandon 's character , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" as an excellent man , is well established . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" His character , however , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" does not rest on ONE act of kindness , to which his affection for Marianne , were humanity out of the case , would have prompted him . To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him?--Did you allow him to hope ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" To judge from the Colonel 's spirits , however , you have not yet made him equally sanguine . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" If you could be assured of that , you think you should be easy . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes . My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;-- for not only is it horrible to suspect a person , who has been what HE has been to ME , of such designs,--but what must it make me appear to myself?--What in a situation like mine , but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to""--"
Elinor Dashwood	""" How then , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" would you account for his behaviour ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I would suppose him,--Oh , how gladly would I suppose him , only fickle , very , very fickle . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Do you compare your conduct with his ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Our situations have borne little resemblance . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You consider the matter , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it ; and I dare say you perceive , as well as myself , not only in this , but in many other circumstances , reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments , in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection , on his side , much less certain . Had you married , you must have been always poor . His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self - denial is a word hardly understood by him . His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before . YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you , I know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that-- and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge HIS enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" The whole of his behaviour , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" from the beginning to the end of the affair , has been grounded on selfishness . It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections ; which afterwards , when his own were engaged , made him delay the confession of it , and which finally carried him from Barton . His own enjoyment , or his own ease , was , in every particular , his ruling principle . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" At present , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" he regrets what he has done . And why does he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towards himself . It has not made him happy . His circumstances are now unembarrassed -- he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself . But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have been different . He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing . He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous -- always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby 's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams . That crime has been the origin of every lesser one , and of all his present discontents . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I see Mr. Ferrars myself , ma'am , this morning in Exeter , and his lady too , Miss Steele as was . They was stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn , as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother , who is one of the post - boys . I happened to look up as I went by the chaise , and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele ; so I took off my hat , and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma'am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars 's , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they 'd make sure to come and see you . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , ma'am . She smiled , and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts . She was always a very affable and free - spoken young lady , and very civil behaved . So , I made free to wish her joy . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , ma'am , I just see him leaning back in it , but he did not look up;--he never was a gentleman much for talking . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Was there no one else in the carriage ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , ma'am , only they two . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Do you know where they came from ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" They come straight from town , as Miss Lucy-- Mrs. Ferrars told me . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" And are they going farther westward ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , ma'am -- but not to bide long . They will soon be back again , and then they 'd be sure and call here . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Did you see them off , before you came away ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , ma'am -- the horses were just coming out , but I could not bide any longer ; I was afraid of being late . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Did Mrs. Ferrars look well ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Yes , ma'am , she said how she was very well ; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady -- and she seemed vastly contented . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" When do you write to Colonel Brandon , ma'am ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" He comes from Mr. Pratt 's purposely to see us . I WILL be calm ; I WILL be mistress of myself . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple ? """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No , my mother is in town . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I meant , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" to inquire for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" THAT was exactly like Robert,""--was"
Elinor Dashwood	""" However it may have come about , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" She will be more hurt by it , for Robert always was her favourite.--She will be more hurt by it , and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" No ; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour ; that your own family might in time relent . And at any rate , she lost nothing by continuing the engagement , for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions . The connection was certainly a respectable one , and probably gained her consideration among her friends ; and , if nothing more advantageous occurred , it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Your behaviour was certainly very wrong , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" because -- to say nothing of my own conviction , our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT , as you were THEN situated , could never be . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" I was simple enough to think , that because my FAITH was plighted to another , there could be no danger in my being with you ; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour . I felt that I admired you , but I told myself it was only friendship ; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and Lucy , I did not know how far I was got . After that , I suppose , I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex , and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it , were no better than these:--The danger is my own ; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" You may certainly ask to be forgiven , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" because you have offended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother 's anger . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" Do not be alarmed , """
Elinor Dashwood	""" nothing of the kind will be done ; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it . """
Elinor Dashwood	""" It is hardly worth while , Mr. Willoughby , for you to relate , or for me to listen any longer . Such a beginning as this can not be followed by any thing.-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Perhaps , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I may consider it with some surprise . Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly . But yet -- he is not the kind of young man -- there is something wanting -- his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . His eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence . And besides all this , I am afraid , Mamma , he has no real taste . Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor 's drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . He admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . To satisfy me , those characters must be united . I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . Oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward 's manner in reading to us last night ! I felt for my sister most severely . Yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it . I could hardly keep my seat . To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference!""--"
Marianne Dashwood	""" Nay , Mamma , if he is not to be animated by Cowper!-- but we must allow for difference of taste . Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him . But it would have broke MY heart , had I loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility . Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love . I require so much ! He must have all Edward 's virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" What a pity it is , Elinor , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" that Edward should have no taste for drawing . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Do not be offended , Elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits . I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense . I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Esteem him ! Like him ! Cold - hearted Elinor ! Oh ! worse than cold - hearted ! Ashamed of being otherwise . Use those words again , and I will leave the room this moment . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" And you really are not engaged to him ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Yet it certainly soon will happen . But two advantages will proceed from this delay . I shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . Oh ! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself , how delightful it would be ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Dear , dear Norland ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" when shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh ! happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you , ye well - known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!--No ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!--But who will remain to enjoy you ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" A woman of seven and twenty , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife . In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable . It would be a compact of convenience , and the world would be satisfied . In my eyes it would be no marriage at all , but that would be nothing . To me it would seem only a commercial exchange , in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" But he talked of flannel waistcoats , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches , cramps , rheumatisms , and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Had he been only in a violent fever , you would not have despised him half so much . Confess , Marianne , is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek , hollow eye , and quick pulse of a fever ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Mamma , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I can not conceal from you . I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well . We have now been here almost a fortnight , and yet he does not come . Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay . What else can detain him at Norland ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" How strange this is ! what can be the meaning of it ! But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable ! How cold , how composed were their last adieus ! How languid their conversation the last evening of their being together ! In Edward 's farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me : it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both . Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room . And Elinor , in quitting Norland and Edward , cried not as I did . Even now her self - command is invariable . When is she dejected or melancholy ? When does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Is there a felicity in the world , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" superior to this?--Margaret , we will walk here at least two hours . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" And is that all you can say for him ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance ? What his pursuits , his talents , and genius ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Did he indeed ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" and with elegance , with spirit ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" That is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be . Whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" That is an expression , Sir John , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" which I particularly dislike . I abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is intended ; and ' setting one 's cap at a man , ' or ' making a conquest , ' are the most odious of all . Their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Elinor , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" is this fair ? is this just ? are my ideas so scanty ? But I see what you mean . I have been too much at my ease , too happy , too frank . I have erred against every common - place notion of decorum ; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved , spiritless , dull , and deceitful -- had I talked only of the weather and the roads , and had I spoken only once in ten minutes , this reproach would have been spared . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" That is exactly what I think of him , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" That is to say , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" he has told you , that in the East Indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Add to which , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . That his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I must not tell , ma'am . But I know very well what it is ; and I know where he is too . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No , THAT he is not . He is of no profession at all . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Margaret , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" you know that all this is an invention of your own , and that there is no such person in existence . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Well , then , he is lately dead , Marianne , for I am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an F. """
Marianne Dashwood	""" that it rained very hard , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" But if you write a note to the housekeeper , Mr. Brandon , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" will it not be sufficient ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I have no doubt of it , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Yes ; it is about Miss Williams , I am sure . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" And who is Miss Williams ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" What ! do not you know who Miss Williams is ? I am sure you must have heard of her before . She is a relation of the Colonel 's , my dear ; a very near relation . We will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" She is his natural daughter . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Indeed ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Where , pray?""--"
Marianne Dashwood	""" Yes , yes , Mr. Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne . It is a very large one , I know ; and when I come to see you , I hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Why should you imagine , Elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" On the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , Elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did , I should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives . I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation . I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith 's grounds , or in seeing her house . They will one day be Mr. Willoughby 's , and-- """
Marianne Dashwood	""" You speak very properly . Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected . Though WE have not known him long , he is no stranger in this part of the world ; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage ? Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately , it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once : but this is not the case . It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun , for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance ; and even secrecy , as far as it can be observed , may now be very advisable . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Months ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No -- nor many weeks . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" It is he ; it is indeed;--I know it is!""--and"
Marianne Dashwood	""" He has , he has , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I am sure he has . His air , his coat , his horse . I knew how soon he would come . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" A fortnight ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" And how does dear , dear Norland look ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Oh , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" with what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall ! How have I delighted , as I walked , to see them driven in showers about me by the wind ! What feelings have they , the season , the air altogether inspired ! Now there is no one to regard them . They are seen only as a nuisance , swept hastily off , and driven as much as possible from the sight . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No ; my feelings are not often shared , not often understood . But SOMETIMES they are . ""--As"
Marianne Dashwood	""" Now , Edward , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" here is Barton valley . Look up to it , and be tranquil if you can . Look at those hills ! Did you ever see their equals ? To the left is Barton park , amongst those woods and plantations . You may see the end of the house . And there , beneath that farthest hill , which rises with such grandeur , is our cottage . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" How can you think of dirt , with such objects before you ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" How strange ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No , not all , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" we could not be more unfortunately situated . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" nor how many painful moments . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No . I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I shall not attempt it . I have no wish to be distinguished ; and have every reason to hope I never shall . Thank Heaven ! I can not be forced into genius and eloquence . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" As moderate as those of the rest of the world , I believe . I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy ; but , like every body else it must be in my own way . Greatness will not make me so . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Strange that it would ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Elinor , for shame ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it . Beyond a competence , it can afford no real satisfaction , as far as mere self is concerned . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" And yet two thousand a - year is a very moderate income , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" A family can not well be maintained on a smaller . I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands . A proper establishment of servants , a carriage , perhaps two , and hunters , can not be supported on less . """
Marianne Dashwood	"Edward--""but why must you have hunters ? Every body does not hunt . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" But most people do . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Oh that they would ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Nay , Edward , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" you need not reproach me . You are not very gay yourself . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" But I thought it was right , Elinor , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people . I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours . This has always been your doctrine , I am sure . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" But you would still be reserved , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" and that is worse . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I am afraid it is but too true , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" but why should you boast of it ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" It is very true , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon . Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was . I detest jargon of every kind , and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself , because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I never saw you wear a ring before , Edward , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Is that Fanny 's hair ? I remember her promising to give you some . But I should have thought her hair had been darker . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" A dance ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Impossible ! Who is to dance ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Oh , Edward ! How can you?--But the time will come I hope ... I am sure you will like him . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Why should they ask us ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" The rent of this cottage is said to be low ; but we have it on very hard terms , if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them , or with us . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Yet I hardly know how , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" unless it had been under totally different circumstances . But this is the usual way of heightening alarm , where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME -- you know I detest cards . I shall go to the piano - forte ; I have not touched it since it was tuned . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned . I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while . That would be enough for us to marry upon , and we might trust to time and chance for the rest . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward 's going into orders . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I thank you , ma'am , sincerely thank you , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it . But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother,--I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence -- Oh ! no , nothing should tempt me to leave her . It should not , must not be a struggle . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation . I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I am NOT going to write to my mother , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" That is true , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I had not thought of that . This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" It is charming weather for THEM indeed , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" How much they must enjoy it ! But """
Marianne Dashwood	""" it can not be expected to last long . At this time of the year , and after such a series of rain , we shall certainly have very little more of it . Frosts will soon set in , and in all probability with severity . In another day or two perhaps ; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer -- nay , perhaps it may freeze tonight ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Do n't you find it colder than it was in the morning , Elinor ? There seems to me a very decided difference . I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff . It was not so yesterday , I think . The clouds seem parting too , the sun will be out in a moment , and we shall have a clear afternoon . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Good God ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" he has been here while we were out . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" For me ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No , ma'am , for my mistress . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings ; how provoking ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Yes , a little -- not much . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" You have no confidence in me , Marianne . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Nay , Elinor , this reproach from YOU -- you who have confidence in no one ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Nor I , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" our situations then are alike . We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I do not know . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Invited ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" But have you not received my notes ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Here is some mistake I am sure -- some dreadful mistake . What can be the meaning of it ? Tell me , Willoughby ; for heaven 's sake tell me , what is the matter ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Go to him , Elinor , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" and force him to come to me . Tell him I must see him again -- must speak to him instantly.-- I can not rest -- I shall not have a moment 's peace till this is explained -- some dreadful misapprehension or other.-- Oh go to him this moment . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" How can that be done ? No , my dearest Marianne , you must wait . This is not the place for explanations . Wait only till tomorrow . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Oh ! Elinor , I am miserable , indeed , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I can not , I can not , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" leave me , leave me , if I distress you ; leave me , hate me , forget me ! but do not torture me so . Oh ! how easy for those , who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion ! Happy , happy Elinor , YOU can not have an idea of what I suffer . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Forgive me , forgive me , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I know you feel for me ; I know what a heart you have ; but yet you are -- you must be happy ; Edward loves you -- what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No , no , no , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" he loves you , and only you . You CAN have no grief . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" And you will never see me otherwise . Mine is a misery which nothing can do away . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" You must not talk so , Marianne . Have you no comforts ? no friends ? Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation ? Much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period-- if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it . Every additional day of unhappy confidence , on your side , would have made the blow more dreadful . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Engagement ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" there has been no engagement . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No engagement ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No , he is not so unworthy as you believe him . He has broken no faith with me . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" But he told you that he loved you . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Yes -- no -- never absolutely . It was every day implied , but never professedly declared . Sometimes I thought it had been -- but it never was . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Yet you wrote to him?""--"
Marianne Dashwood	""" Yes -- could that be wrong after all that had passed?-- But I can not talk . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I felt myself , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" The lady then -- Miss Grey I think you called her-- is very rich ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is ? Is she said to be amiable ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" And who are the Ellisons ? """
Marianne Dashwood	"moment--""your poor sister is gone to her own room , I suppose , to moan by herself . Is there nothing one can get to comfort her ? Poor dear , it seems quite cruel to let her be alone . Well , by - and - by we shall have a few friends , and that will amuse her a little . What shall we play at ? She hates whist I know ; but is there no round game she cares for ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Dear ma'am , this kindness is quite unnecessary . Marianne , I dare say , will not leave her room again this evening . I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed , for I am sure she wants rest . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Aye , I believe that will be best for her . Let her name her own supper , and go to bed . Lord ! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two , for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that . And so the letter that came today finished it ! Poor soul ! I am sure if I had had a notion of it , I would not have joked her about it for all my money . But then you know , how should I guess such a thing ? I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter , and you know young people like to be laughed at about them . Lord ! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it ! If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street in my way home , and told them of it . But I shall see them tomorrow . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" It would be unnecessary I am sure , for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister . Their own good - nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings will be spared , as you my dear madam will easily believe . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Oh ! Lord ! yes , that I do indeed . It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world . You saw I did not all dinner time . No more would Sir John , nor my daughters , for they are all very thoughtful and considerate ; especially if I give them a hint , as I certainly will . For my part , I think the less that is said about such things , the better , the sooner ' tis blown over and forgot . And what does talking ever do you know ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" In this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation . I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughby -- he has broken no positive engagement with my sister . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Law , my dear ! Do n't pretend to defend him . No positive engagement indeed ! after taking her all over Allenham House , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" It is Colonel Brandon ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" We are never safe from HIM . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I will not trust to THAT , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" You are very good . My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head - aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Dear Edward ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" this is a moment of great happiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Oh , do n't think of me ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" do n't think of MY health . Elinor is well , you see . That must be enough for us both . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Not at all . I expected much pleasure in it , but I have found none . The sight of you , Edward , is the only comfort it has afforded ; and thank Heaven ! you are what you always were ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I think , Elinor , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton . In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" We spent such a day , Edward , in Harley Street yesterday ! So dull , so wretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head , which can not be said now . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" But why were you not there , Edward?--Why did you not come ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I was engaged elsewhere . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Engaged ! But what was that , when such friends were to be met ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street . And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure . He is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body I ever saw . Edward , it is so , and I will say it . What ! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Going so soon ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" my dear Edward , this must not be . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" What can bring her here so often ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Could not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teazing to Edward ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Why so?--we were all his friends , and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any . It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" You know , Elinor , that this is a kind of talking which I can not bear . If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted , as I must suppose to be the case , you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it . I can not descend to be tricked out of assurances , that are not really wanted . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" How long has this been known to you , Elinor ? has he written to you ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I have known it these four months . When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November , she told me in confidence of her engagement . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Four months!--Have you known of this four months ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" What!--while attending me in all my misery , has this been on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!""--"
Marianne Dashwood	""" It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Four months!""--cried"
Marianne Dashwood	"again.--""So calm!-- so cheerful!--how have you been supported?""--"
Marianne Dashwood	""" By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to Lucy , obliged me to be secret . I owed it to her , therefore , to avoid giving any hint of the truth ; and I owed it to my family and friends , not to create in them a solicitude about me , which it could not be in my power to satisfy . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Four months!--and yet you loved him!""--"
Marianne Dashwood	""" If such is your way of thinking , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else , your resolution , your self - command , are , perhaps , a little less to be wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Oh ! Elinor , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" you have made me hate myself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!-- you , who have been my only comfort , who have borne with me in all my misery , who have seemed to be only suffering for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I can make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself , I have been trying to do it away . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Gracious God ! can this be possible ! """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I am sorry to say , ma'am , in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother 's notice . He left her house yesterday , but where he is gone , or whether he is still in town , I do not know ; for WE of course can make no inquiry . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" What , indeed , ma'am ! It is a melancholy consideration . Born to the prospect of such affluence ! I can not conceive a situation more deplorable . The interest of two thousand pounds -- how can a man live on it?--and when to that is added the recollection , that he might , but for his own folly , within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand , five hundred a - year ( for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds , ) I can not picture to myself a more wretched condition . We must all feel for him ; and the more so , because it is totally out of our power to assist him . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Is mama coming?-- """
Marianne Dashwood	""" But she must not go round by London , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I shall never see her , if she goes by London . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" At last we are alone . My Elinor , you do not yet know all my happiness . Colonel Brandon loves Marianne . He has told me so himself . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" You are never like me , dear Elinor , or I should wonder at your composure now . Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family , I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon 's marrying one of you as the object most desirable . And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" When the weather is settled , and I have recovered my strength , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" we will take long walks together every day . We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down , and see how the children go on ; we will walk to Sir John 's new plantations at Barton Cross , and the Abbeyland ; and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory , and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached . I know we shall be happy . I know the summer will pass happily away . I mean never to be later in rising than six , and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading . I have formed my plan , and am determined to enter on a course of serious study . Our own library is too well known to me , to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement . But there are many works well worth reading at the Park ; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon . By reading only six hours a - day , I shall gain in the course of a twelve - month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" There , exactly there,""--pointing"
Marianne Dashwood	""" on that projecting mound,--there I fell ; and there I first saw Willoughby . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject , Elinor?""--"
Marianne Dashwood	"said.--""Or will it be wrong?--I can talk of it now , I hope , as I ought to do . ""--"
Marianne Dashwood	""" As for regret , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I have done with that , as far as HE is concerned . I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him , but what they are NOW.--At present , if I could be satisfied on one point , if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting a part , not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all , if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him , since the story of that unfortunate girl""--"
Marianne Dashwood	""" I am not wishing him too much good , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own . He will suffer enough in them . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No . I compare it with what it ought to have been ; I compare it with yours . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" They have borne more than our conduct.--Do not , my dearest Elinor , let your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure . My illness has made me think-- It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection . Long before I was enough recovered to talk , I was perfectly able to reflect . I considered the past : I saw in my own behaviour , since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn , nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself , and want of kindness to others . I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings , and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave . My illness , I well knew , had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health , as I had felt even at the time to be wrong . Had I died,--it would have been self - destruction . I did not know my danger till the danger was removed ; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me , I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live , to have time for atonement to my God , and to you all , did not kill me at once . Had I died,-- in what peculiar misery should I have left you , my nurse , my friend , my sister!--You , who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days ; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!--How should I have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too ! How could you have consoled her!--I can not express my own abhorrence of myself . Whenever I looked towards the past , I saw some duty neglected , or some failing indulged . Every body seemed injured by me . The kindness , the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings , I had repaid with ungrateful contempt . To the Middletons , to the Palmers , the Steeles , to every common acquaintance even , I had been insolent and unjust ; with a heart hardened against their merits , and a temper irritated by their very attention.--To John , to Fanny,--yes , even to them , little as they deserve , I had given less than their due . But you,--you above all , above my mother , had been wronged by me . I , and only I , knew your heart and its sorrows ; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was before me ; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate of you and your comfort ? Did I imitate your forbearance , or lessen your restraints , by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;-- not less when I knew you to be unhappy , than when I had believed you at ease , did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship ; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me , regretting only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me , and leaving you , for or I professed an unbounded affection , to be miserable for my sake . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" You are very good.--The future must be my proof . I have laid down my plan , and if I am capable of adhering to it -- my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved . They shall no longer worry others , nor torture myself . I shall now live solely for my family . You , my mother , and Margaret , must henceforth be all the world to me ; you will share my affections entirely between you . > From you , from my home , I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move ; and if I do mix in other society , it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled , my heart amended , and that I can practise the civilities , the lesser duties of life , with gentleness and forbearance . As for Willoughby -- to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him , would be idle . His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions . But it shall be regulated , it shall be checked by religion , by reason , by constant employment . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I wish to assure you both , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" that I see every thing -- as you can desire me to do . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" It is a great relief to me -- what Elinor told me this morning -- I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear . ""--For"
Marianne Dashwood	"before--""I am now perfectly satisfied , I wish for no change . I never could have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later I must have known , all this.--I should have had no confidence , no esteem . Nothing could have done it away to my feelings . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Happy with a man of libertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends , and the best of men!--No -- my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience , her sensitive conscience , would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I wish for no change . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Selfish ? """
Marianne Dashwood	"implied--""do you really think him selfish ? """
Marianne Dashwood	""" It is very true . MY happiness never was his object . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I have not a doubt of it , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" and I have nothing to regret -- nothing but my own folly . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" Mrs. Robert Ferrars!""--was"
Marianne Dashwood	""" And if they really DO interest themselves , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" No , no , """
Marianne Dashwood	""" misery such as mine has no pride . I care not who knows that I am wretched . The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world . Elinor , Elinor , they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like -- may resist insult , or return mortification -- but I can not . I must feel -- I must be wretched -- and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can . """
Marianne Dashwood	""" I would do more than for my own . But to appear happy when I am so miserable -- Oh ! who can require it ? """
Edward Ferrars	""" I was at Norland about a month ago . """
Edward Ferrars	""" What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London , """
Edward Ferrars	""" in such an event ! What a happy day for booksellers , music - sellers , and print - shops ! You , Miss Dashwood , would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you -- and as for Marianne , I know her greatness of soul , there would not be music enough in London to content her . And books!--Thomson , Cowper , Scott -- she would buy them all over and over again : she would buy up every copy , I believe , to prevent their falling into unworthy hands ; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree . Should not you , Marianne ? Forgive me , if I am very saucy . But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old disputes . """
Edward Ferrars	""" And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs . """
Edward Ferrars	""" Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life -- your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ? """
Edward Ferrars	""" You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility , """
Edward Ferrars	""" Do you gain no ground ? """
Edward Ferrars	""" My judgment , """
Edward Ferrars	""" is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister 's . I never wish to offend , but I am so foolishly shy , that I often seem negligent , when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness . I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company , I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility ! """
Edward Ferrars	""" She knows her own worth too well for false shame , """
Edward Ferrars	""" Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other . If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful , I should not be shy . """
Edward Ferrars	"started--""Reserved ! Am I reserved , Marianne ? """
Edward Ferrars	""" Yes , very . """
Edward Ferrars	""" I do not understand you , """
Edward Ferrars	""" Reserved!--how , in what manner ? What am I to tell you ? What can you suppose ? """
Edward Ferrars	""" I am going into the village to see my horses , """
Edward Ferrars	""" as you are not yet ready for breakfast ; I shall be back again presently . """
Edward Ferrars	""" You must not enquire too far , Marianne -- remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque , and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars . I shall call hills steep , which ought to be bold ; surfaces strange and uncouth , which ought to be irregular and rugged ; and distant objects out of sight , which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere . You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give . I call it a very fine country -- the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and the valley looks comfortable and snug -- with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there . It exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility -- and I dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me . I know nothing of the picturesque . """
Edward Ferrars	""" I am convinced , """
Edward Ferrars	""" that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel . But , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess . I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles . I do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees . I admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing . I do not like ruined , tattered cottages . I am not fond of nettles or thistles , or heath blossoms . I have more pleasure in a snug farm - house than a watch - tower -- and a troop of tidy , happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world . """
Edward Ferrars	""" Yes ; it is my sister 's hair . The setting always casts a different shade on it , you know . """
Edward Ferrars	""" I have been guessing . Shall I tell you my guess ? """
Edward Ferrars	""" What do you mean ? """
Edward Ferrars	""" Shall I tell you . """
Edward Ferrars	""" Certainly . """
Edward Ferrars	""" Well then ; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts . """
Edward Ferrars	""" I do not doubt it , """
Edward Ferrars	""" I do assure you , """
Edward Ferrars	""" that I have long thought on this point , as you think now . It has been , and is , and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me , that I have had no necessary business to engage me , no profession to give me employment , or afford me any thing like independence . But unfortunately my own nicety , and the nicety of my friends , have made me what I am , an idle , helpless being . We never could agree in our choice of a profession . I always preferred the church , as I still do . But that was not smart enough for my family . They recommended the army . That was a great deal too smart for me . The law was allowed to be genteel enough ; many young men , who had chambers in the Temple , made a very good appearance in the first circles , and drove about town in very knowing gigs . But I had no inclination for the law , even in this less abstruse study of it , which my family approved . As for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it -- and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing . I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since . """
Edward Ferrars	""" I think , """
Edward Ferrars	""" that I may defy many months to produce any good to me . """
Edward Ferrars	""" Do you like London ? """
Edward Ferrars	""" Mrs. Jennings told me , """
Edward Ferrars	""" that you wished to speak with me , at least I understood her so -- or I certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner ; though at the same time , I should have been extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister ; especially as it will most likely be some time -- it is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again . I go to Oxford tomorrow . """
Edward Ferrars	""" Colonel Brandon ! """
Edward Ferrars	""" Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can it be possible ? """
Edward Ferrars	""" No , """
Edward Ferrars	""" not to find it in YOU ; for I can not be ignorant that to you , to your goodness , I owe it all.--I feel it -- I would express it if I could -- but , as you well know , I am no orator . """
Edward Ferrars	""" Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability . I have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother I know esteems him highly . He is undoubtedly a sensible man , and in his manners perfectly the gentleman . """
Edward Ferrars	""" Colonel Brandon , I think , lodges in St. James Street , """
Edward Ferrars	""" We may treat it as a joke , """
Edward Ferrars	"moment--""but , upon my soul , it is a most serious business . Poor Edward ! he is ruined for ever . I am extremely sorry for it-- for I know him to be a very good - hearted creature ; as well - meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world . You must not judge of him , Miss Dashwood , from YOUR slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature.--But we are not all born , you know , with the same powers,--the same address.-- Poor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!-- to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul , I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom ; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life , as when it all burst forth . I could not believe it.-- My mother was the first person who told me of it ; and I , feeling myself called on to act with resolution , immediately said to her , ' My dear madam , I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion , but as for myself , I must say , that if Edward does marry this young woman , I never will see him again . ' That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society!--but , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected . My poor mother was half frantic . """
Edward Ferrars	""" Have you ever seen the lady ? """
John Willoughby	""" Brandon is just the kind of man , """
John Willoughby	""" whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to . """
John Willoughby	""" That he is patronised by YOU , """
John Willoughby	""" is certainly in his favour ; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself . Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings , that could command the indifference of any body else ? """
John Willoughby	""" In defence of your protege you can even be saucy . """
John Willoughby	""" Perhaps , """
John Willoughby	""" his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins . """
John Willoughby	""" I do not dislike him . I consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body 's good word , and nobody 's notice ; who , has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year . """
John Willoughby	""" Miss Dashwood , """
John Willoughby	""" you are now using me unkindly . You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will . But it will not do . You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful . I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon ; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and I can not persuade him to buy my brown mare . If it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable , I am ready to confess it . And in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you can not deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever . """
John Willoughby	"voice,--""But , Marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . I shall keep it only till you can claim it . When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , Queen Mab shall receive you . """
John Willoughby	""" You would not be six hours later , """
John Willoughby	""" if you were to defer your journey till our return . """
John Willoughby	""" There are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . Brandon is one of them . He was afraid of catching cold I dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it . I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing . """
John Willoughby	""" Did not you know , """
John Willoughby	""" that we had been out in my curricle ? """
John Willoughby	""" What ! """
John Willoughby	"exclaimed--""Improve this dear cottage ! No . THAT I will never consent to . Not a stone must be added to its walls , not an inch to its size , if my feelings are regarded . """
John Willoughby	""" I am heartily glad of it , """
John Willoughby	""" May she always be poor , if she can employ her riches no better . """
John Willoughby	""" Thank you , Willoughby . But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours , or of any one whom I loved , for all the improvements in the world . Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain , when I make up my accounts in the spring , I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you . But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it ? """
John Willoughby	""" I am , """
John Willoughby	""" To me it is faultless . Nay , more , I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable , and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down , and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage . """
John Willoughby	""" Yes , """
John Willoughby	""" with all and every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience or INconvenience about it , should the least variation be perceptible . Then , and then only , under such a roof , I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton . """
John Willoughby	""" There certainly are circumstances , """
John Willoughby	""" which might greatly endear it to me ; but this place will always have one claim of my affection , which no other can possibly share . """
John Willoughby	""" How often did I wish , """
John Willoughby	""" when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth , that Barton cottage were inhabited ! I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation , and grieving that no one should live in it . How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs. Smith , when I next came into the country , would be that Barton cottage was taken : and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event , which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it , can account for . Must it not have been so , Marianne ? """
John Willoughby	""" And yet this house you would spoil , Mrs. Dashwood ? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement ! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began , and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together , you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance , and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford . """
John Willoughby	""" You are a good woman , """
John Willoughby	""" Your promise makes me easy . Extend it a little farther , and it will make me happy . Tell me that not only your house will remain the same , but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling ; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me . """
John Willoughby	""" I hope not , """
John Willoughby	""" It is I who may rather expect to be ill -- for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment ! """
John Willoughby	""" Yes , for I am unable to keep my engagement with you . Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin , by sending me on business to London . I have just received my dispatches , and taken my farewell of Allenham ; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you . """
John Willoughby	""" Almost this moment . """
John Willoughby	""" My engagements at present , """
John Willoughby	""" are of such a nature -- that -- I dare not flatter myself""--"
John Willoughby	""" It is folly to linger in this manner . I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy . """
John Willoughby	""" Is your sister ill ? """
John Willoughby	""" Yes , """
John Willoughby	""" almost ever since ; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to Barton . """
John Willoughby	""" your sister looks unwell to - day , """
John Willoughby	""" your sister seems out of spirits , """
John Willoughby	""" your sister 's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known . """
John Willoughby	""" I beg your pardon , I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of . """
John Willoughby	""" How can that be ? By whom can you have heard it mentioned ? """
John Willoughby	""" By many -- by some of whom you know nothing , by others with whom you are most intimate , Mrs. Jennings , Mrs. Palmer , and the Middletons . But still I might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister 's writing . I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question . Is every thing finally settled ? Is it impossible to- ? But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding . Excuse me , Miss Dashwood . I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence . Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains . """
John Willoughby	""" to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her,""--took"
John Willoughby	""" Miss Dashwood , for half an hour -- for ten minutes-- I entreat you to stay . """
John Willoughby	""" Had they told me , """
John Willoughby	""" that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil , it would not have turned me from the door . My business is with you , and only you . """
John Willoughby	"amazement--""well , sir,-- be quick -- and if you can -- less violent . """
John Willoughby	""" Your sister , """
John Willoughby	"afterwards--""is out of danger . I heard it from the servant . God be praised!--But is it true ? is it really true ? """
John Willoughby	""" For God 's sake tell me , is she out of danger , or is she not ? """
John Willoughby	""" We hope she is . """
John Willoughby	""" Had I known as much half an hour ago -- But since I AM here,""--speaking"
John Willoughby	"seat--""what does it signify?--For once , Miss Dashwood -- it will be the last time , perhaps -- let us be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for gaiety.-- Tell me honestly""--a"
John Willoughby	""" do you think me most a knave or a fool ? """
John Willoughby	""" I understand you , """
John Willoughby	""" yes , I am very drunk.-- A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was enough to over - set me . """
John Willoughby	""" At Marlborough!""--cried"
John Willoughby	""" Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o'clock , and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough . """
John Willoughby	""" I mean,""--said"
John Willoughby	""" Upon my soul it is,""--was"
John Willoughby	""" Has she?""--he"
John Willoughby	""" Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it . But she shall forgive me again , and on more reasonable grounds.--NOW will you listen to me ? """
John Willoughby	""" I do not know , """
John Willoughby	"own,--""how YOU may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister , or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.-- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is worth the trial however , and you shall hear every thing . When I first became intimate in your family , I had no other intention , no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire , more pleasantly than I had ever done before . Your sister 's lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me ; and her behaviour to me almost from the first , was of a kind -- It is astonishing , when I reflect on what it was , and what SHE was , that my heart should have been so insensible ! But at first I must confess , my vanity only was elevated by it . Careless of her happiness , thinking only of my own amusement , giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging , I endeavoured , by every means in my power , to make myself pleasing to her , without any design of returning her affection . """
John Willoughby	""" Remember , """
John Willoughby	""" from whom you received the account . Could it be an impartial one ? I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me . I do not mean to justify myself , but at the same time can not leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge -- that because she was injured she was irreproachable , and because I was a libertine , SHE must be a saint . If the violence of her passions , the weakness of her understanding -- I do not mean , however , to defend myself . Her affection for me deserved better treatment , and I often , with great self - reproach , recall the tenderness which , for a very short time , had the power of creating any return . I wish -- I heartily wish it had never been . But I have injured more than herself ; and I have injured one , whose affection for me--(may I say it ? ) was scarcely less warm than hers ; and whose mind -- Oh ! how infinitely superior!""--"
John Willoughby	""" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off . """
John Willoughby	""" Are you going back to town ? """
John Willoughby	""" No -- to Combe Magna . I have business there ; from thence to town in a day or two . Good bye . """
John Willoughby	""" poor Willoughby , """
John Willoughby	""" humble servant , """
John Willoughby	""""
Lucy Steele	""" Poor little creatures ! """
Lucy Steele	""" It might have been a very sad accident . """
Lucy Steele	""" What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is ! """
Lucy Steele	""" I have a notion , """
Lucy Steele	""" you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton ; and for my part , I love to see children full of life and spirits ; I can not bear them if they are tame and quiet . """
Lucy Steele	""" And how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex . """
Lucy Steele	""" Norland is a prodigious beautiful place , is not it ? """
Lucy Steele	""" We have heard Sir John admire it excessively , """
Lucy Steele	""" And had you a great many smart beaux there ? I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world ; for my part , I think they are a vast addition always . """
Lucy Steele	""" But why should you think , """
Lucy Steele	""" that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex ? """
Lucy Steele	""" Nay , my dear , I 'm sure I do n't pretend to say that there an't . I 'm sure there 's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter ; but you know , how could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland ; and I was only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton , if they had not so many as they used to have . But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux , and had as lief be without them as with them . For my part , I think they are vastly agreeable , provided they dress smart and behave civil . But I ca n't bear to see them dirty and nasty . Now there 's Mr. Rose at Exeter , a prodigious smart young man , quite a beau , clerk to Mr. Simpson , you know , and yet if you do but meet him of a morning , he is not fit to be seen.-- I suppose your brother was quite a beau , Miss Dashwood , before he married , as he was so rich ? """
Lucy Steele	""" Oh ! dear ! one never thinks of married men 's being beaux -- they have something else to do . """
Lucy Steele	""" Ferrars ! """
Lucy Steele	""" Mr. Ferrars is the happy man , is he ? What ! your sister - in - law 's brother , Miss Dashwood ? a very agreeable young man to be sure ; I know him very well . """
Lucy Steele	""" How can you say so , Anne ? """
Lucy Steele	""" Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle 's , it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well . """
Lucy Steele	""" You will think my question an odd one , I dare say , """
Lucy Steele	""" Indeed ! """
Lucy Steele	""" I wonder at that , for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes . Then , perhaps , you can not tell me what sort of a woman she is ? """
Lucy Steele	""" I know nothing of her . """
Lucy Steele	""" I am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way , """
Lucy Steele	""" but perhaps there may be reasons -- I wish I might venture ; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent . """
Lucy Steele	""" I can not bear to have you think me impertinently curious . I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours . And I am sure I should not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU ; indeed , I should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation as I am ; but , however , there is no occasion to trouble YOU . I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars . """
Lucy Steele	""" No , """
Lucy Steele	""" not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars -- I never saw him in my life ; but , """
Lucy Steele	""" to his eldest brother . """
Lucy Steele	""" You may well be surprised , """
Lucy Steele	""" for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before ; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family ; because it was always meant to be a great secret , and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour . Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne , and I never should have mentioned it to you , if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy ; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars must seem so odd , that it ought to be explained . And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased , when he knows I have trusted you , because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family , and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters . ""--She"
Lucy Steele	""" We can mean no other , """
Lucy Steele	""" Mr. Edward Ferrars , the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars , of Park Street , and brother of your sister - in - law , Mrs. John Dashwood , is the person I mean ; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends . """
Lucy Steele	""" I have never been able , """
Lucy Steele	""" to give him my picture in return , which I am very much vexed at , for he has been always so anxious to get it ! But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity . """
Lucy Steele	""" I am sure , """
Lucy Steele	""" I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say . I shall have no fortune , and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman . """
Lucy Steele	""" Sometimes . """
Lucy Steele	""" I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely . """
Lucy Steele	""" To be sure , """
Lucy Steele	""" his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor Edward is so cast down by it ! Did you not think him dreadful low - spirited when he was at Barton ? He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple , to go to you , that I was afraid you would think him quite ill . """
Lucy Steele	""" Oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us . Did you think he came directly from town ? """
Lucy Steele	""" Did not you think him sadly out of spirits ? """
Lucy Steele	""" I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter ; but it made him so melancholy , not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us , and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now ; for he writes in wretched spirits . I heard from him just before I left Exeter ; """
Lucy Steele	""" You know his hand , I dare say , a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible . """
Lucy Steele	""" Writing to each other , """
Lucy Steele	""" is the only comfort we have in such long separations . Yes , I have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even THAT . If he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture . Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him ? """
Lucy Steele	""" Indeed you are very much mistaken , Lady Middleton ; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me , or I should have been at my filigree already . I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card - table now , I am resolved to finish the basket after supper . """
Lucy Steele	""" Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help , """
Lucy Steele	""" for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was ; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all . """
Lucy Steele	""" Thank you , """
Lucy Steele	""" for breaking the ice ; you have set my heart at ease by it ; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday . """
Lucy Steele	""" And yet I do assure you , """
Lucy Steele	""" there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable . I felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs . But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me . If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life , your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure . """
Lucy Steele	""" Indeed , I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you , to acknowledge your situation to me , and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it . Your case is a very unfortunate one ; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties , and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them . Mr. Ferrars , I believe , is entirely dependent on his mother . """
Lucy Steele	""" He has only two thousand pounds of his own ; it would be madness to marry upon that , though for my own part , I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh . I have been always used to a very small income , and could struggle with any poverty for him ; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him , perhaps , of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her . We must wait , it may be for many years . With almost every other man in the world , it would be an alarming prospect ; but Edward 's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know . """
Lucy Steele	""" That conviction must be every thing to you ; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your 's . If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed , as between many people , and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years ' engagement , your situation would have been pitiable , indeed . """
Lucy Steele	""" Edward 's love for me , """
Lucy Steele	""" has been pretty well put to the test , by our long , very long absence since we were first engaged , and it has stood the trial so well , that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now . I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment 's alarm on that account from the first . """
Lucy Steele	""" I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature , and from our different situations in life , from his being so much more in the world than me , and our continual separation , I was enough inclined for suspicion , to have found out the truth in an instant , if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met , or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for , or if he had talked more of one lady than another , or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be . I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick - sighted in general , but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived . """
Lucy Steele	""" is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us . """
Lucy Steele	""" If we could be certain that it would be only for a while ! But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to Robert , and the idea of that , for Edward 's sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures . """
Lucy Steele	""" A great coxcomb ! """
Lucy Steele	""" No sister , """
Lucy Steele	""" you are mistaken there , our favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs . """
Lucy Steele	""" Oh , """
Lucy Steele	""" I dare say Lucy 's beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood 's . """
Lucy Steele	""" I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement . We seem so beset with difficulties on every side , that though it would make us miserable for a time , we should be happier perhaps in the end . But you will not give me your advice , Miss Dashwood ? """
Lucy Steele	""" Indeed you wrong me , """
Lucy Steele	""" I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ' I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , ' I should resolve upon doing it immediately . """
Lucy Steele	""" ' Tis because you are an indifferent person , """
Lucy Steele	""" that your judgment might justly have such weight with me . If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having . """
Lucy Steele	""" Shall you be in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? """
Lucy Steele	""" Certainly not . """
Lucy Steele	""" It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do . """
Lucy Steele	""" Not in the stage , I assure you , """
Lucy Steele	""" we came post all the way , and had a very smart beau to attend us . Dr. Davies was coming to town , and so we thought we 'd join him in a post - chaise ; and he behaved very genteelly , and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did . """
Lucy Steele	""" There now , """
Lucy Steele	""" everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor , and I can not think why . My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest ; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour 's end to another . ' Lord ! here comes your beau , Nancy , ' my cousin said t'other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house . My beau , indeed ! said I -- I can not think who you mean . The Doctor is no beau of mine . """
Lucy Steele	""" No , indeed ! """
Lucy Steele	""" and I beg you will contradict it , if you ever hear it talked of . """
Lucy Steele	""" I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister , Miss Dashwood , when they come to town , """
Lucy Steele	""" I am sorry we can not see your sister , Miss Dashwood , """
Lucy Steele	""" I am sorry she is not well-- """
Lucy Steele	""" Oh , dear , that is a great pity ! but such old friends as Lucy and me!--I think she might see US ; and I am sure we would not speak a word . """
Lucy Steele	""" Oh , if that 's all , """
Lucy Steele	""" we can just as well go and see HER . """
Lucy Steele	""" Pity me , dear Miss Dashwood ! """
Lucy Steele	""" My dear friend , """
Lucy Steele	""" I come to talk to you of my happiness . Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars 's way of treating me yesterday ? So exceeding affable as she was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;-- but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me . Now was not it so?-- You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ? """
Lucy Steele	""" She was certainly very civil to you . """
Lucy Steele	""" Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast deal more . Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride , no hauteur , and your sister just the same -- all sweetness and affability ! """
Lucy Steele	""" I guessed you would say so""--replied"
Lucy Steele	""" Are you ill , Miss Dashwood?--you seem low -- you do n't speak;--sure you an't well . """
Lucy Steele	""" I never was in better health . """
Lucy Steele	""" I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it . I should be sorry to have YOU ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship . ""--"
Lucy Steele	""" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward 's love , it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton 's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister -- besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;-- and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me.-- They are such charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her , you can not speak too high . """
Lucy Steele	""" I am sure I should have seen it in a moment , if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me . If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way -- you know what I mean -- if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair . I could not have stood it . For where she DOES dislike , I know it is most violent . """
Lucy Steele	""" Perhaps , Miss Marianne , """
Lucy Steele	""" you think young men never stand upon engagements , if they have no mind to keep them , little as well as great . """
Lucy Steele	""" I am so glad to meet you ; """
Lucy Steele	""" Oh , la ! here come the Richardsons . I had a vast deal more to say to you , but I must not stay away from them not any longer . I assure you they are very genteel people . He makes a monstrous deal of money , and they keep their own coach . I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . I suppose Lady Middleton wo n't ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here . Remember me kindly to her . La ! if you have not got your spotted muslin on!--I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Oh ! pray , Miss Margaret , let us know all about it , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" What is the gentleman 's name ? """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at Norland to be sure . He is the curate of the parish I dare say . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" No bad news , Colonel , I hope ; """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married ? """
Mrs. Jennings	""" In town ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" What can you have to do in town at this time of year ? """
Mrs. Jennings	""" If you would but let us know what your business is , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" we might see whether it could be put off or not . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Ay , so do , Sir John , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" and then perhaps you may find out what his business is . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Well , as you are resolved to go , I wish you a good journey . But you had better change your mind . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I am afraid , none at all . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Come Colonel , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" before you go , do let us know what you are going about . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I can guess what his business is , however , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I have found you out in spite of all your tricks . I know where you spent the morning . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Something very melancholy must be the matter , I am sure , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I could see it in his face . Poor man ! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad . The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year , and his brother left everything sadly involved . I do think he must have been sent for about money matters , for what else can it be ? I wonder whether it is so . I would give anything to know the truth of it . Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and , by the bye , I dare say it is , because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her . May be she is ill in town ; nothing in the world more likely , for I have a notion she is always rather sickly . I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams . It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances NOW , for he is a very prudent man , and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time . I wonder what it can be ! May be his sister is worse at Avignon , and has sent for him over . His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it . Well , I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart , and a good wife into the bargain . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" And who knows but you may raise a dance , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" And that will tempt YOU , Miss Marianne . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Who ! why yourselves , and the Careys , and Whitakers to be sure.--What ! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Hush ! they will hear you . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Where is Marianne ? Has she run away because we are come ? I see her instrument is open . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" She is walking , I believe . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" How do you do , my dear ? How does Mrs. Dashwood do ? And where are your sisters ? What ! all alone ! you will be glad of a little company to sit with you . I have brought my other son and daughter to see you . Only think of their coming so suddenly ! I thought I heard a carriage last night , while we were drinking our tea , but it never entered my head that it could be them . I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again""--"
Mrs. Jennings	""" You may believe how glad we all were to see them , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" but , however , I ca n't help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation . I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" She expects to be confined in February , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" You and I , Sir John , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" should not stand upon such ceremony . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill - bred . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood 's is not , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who SHE likes . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Oh , Lord ! I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I 've quite set my heart upon it . Do n't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I sha n't put myself at all out of my way for you . It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford THAT . We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters . I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I do n't get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault . I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Nay , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne 's company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back . But one or the other , if not both of them , I must have . Lord bless me ! how do you think I can live poking by myself , I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me . Come , Miss Marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Oh ! Colonel , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I am monstrous glad to see you -- sorry I could not come before -- beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with-- Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner ! But pray , Colonel , how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today ? """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer 's , where I have been dining . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Oh , you did ; well , and how do they all do at their house ? How does Charlotte do ? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well , and I am commissioned to tell you , that you will certainly see her to - morrow . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Ay , to be sure , I thought as much . Well , Colonel , I have brought two young ladies with me , you see -- that is , you see but one of them now , but there is another somewhere . Your friend , Miss Marianne , too -- which you will not be sorry to hear . I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby will do between you about her . Ay , it is a fine thing to be young and handsome . Well ! I was young once , but I never was very handsome -- worse luck for me . However , I got a very good husband , and I do n't know what the greatest beauty can do more . Ah ! poor man ! he has been dead these eight years and better . But Colonel , where have you been to since we parted ? And how does your business go on ? Come , come , let 's have no secrets among friends . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" If this open weather holds much longer , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week ; ' tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day 's pleasure . Poor souls ! I always pity them when they do ; they seem to take it so much to heart . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Aye , aye , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" For shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood ! how can you talk so ? Do n't we all know that it must be a match , that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met ? Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ? Come , come , this wo n't do . Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long . I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" How do you do my dear?""--said"
Mrs. Jennings	""" How is she , Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing ! she looks very bad.-- No wonder . Ay , it is but too true . He is to be married very soon -- a good - for - nothing fellow ! I have no patience with him . Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was . Well , said I , all I can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out . And so I shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it . I have no notion of men 's going on in this way ; and if ever I meet him again , I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day . But there is one comfort , my dear Miss Marianne ; he is not the only young man in the world worth having ; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers . Well , poor thing ! I wo n't disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with . The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know , and that will amuse her . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Poor soul ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" how it grieves me to see her ! And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine ! And the dried cherries too ! Lord ! nothing seems to do her any good . I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like , I would send all over the town for it . Well , it is the oddest thing to me , that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill ! But when there is plenty of money on one side , and next to none on the other , Lord bless you ! they care no more about such things!-- """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Fifty thousand pounds , my dear . Did you ever see her ? a smart , stylish girl they say , but not handsome . I remember her aunt very well , Biddy Henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man . But the family are all rich together . Fifty thousand pounds ! and by all accounts , it wo n't come before it 's wanted ; for they say he is all to pieces . No wonder ! dashing about with his curricle and hunters ! Well , it do n't signify talking ; but when a young man , be who he will , comes and makes love to a pretty girl , and promises marriage , he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor , and a richer girl is ready to have him . Why do n't he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ? I warrant you , Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round . But that wo n't do now - a - days ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I never heard any harm of her ; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned ; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning , that one day Miss Walker hinted to her , that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married , for she and Mrs. Ellison could never agree . ""--"
Mrs. Jennings	""" Her guardians , my dear . But now she is of age and may choose for herself ; and a pretty choice she has made!--What now , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Well , my dear , ' tis a true saying about an ill - wind , for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon . He will have her at last ; aye , that he will . Mind me , now , if they an't married by Mid - summer . Lord ! how he 'll chuckle over this news ! I hope he will come tonight . It will be all to one a better match for your sister . Two thousand a year without debt or drawback -- except the little love - child , indeed ; aye , I had forgot her ; but she may be ' prenticed out at a small cost , and then what does it signify ? Delaford is a nice place , I can tell you ; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place , full of comforts and conveniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit - trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner ! Lord ! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there ! Then , there is a dove - cote , some delightful stew - ponds , and a very pretty canal ; and every thing , in short , that one could wish for ; and , moreover , it is close to the church , and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike - road , so ' tis never dull , for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house , you may see all the carriages that pass along . Oh ! ' tis a nice place ! A butcher hard by in the village , and the parsonage - house within a stone 's throw . To my fancy , a thousand times prettier than Barton Park , where they are forced to send three miles for their meat , and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother . Well , I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can . One shoulder of mutton , you know , drives another down . If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" My dear , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted , so I have brought a glass of it for your sister . My poor husband ! how fond he was of it ! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout , he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world . Do take it to your sister . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see . He knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Marianne is not well , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" She has been indisposed all day , and we have persuaded her to go to bed . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" What did you hear ? """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Now , my dear , I bring you something that I am sure will do you good . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Well , my dear , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" and how did you travel ? """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Oh , oh ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" very pretty , indeed ! and the Doctor is a single man , I warrant you . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" No , I do not think we shall . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Oh , yes , I dare say you will . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Long a time , indeed ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Why , their visit is but just begun ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Excellent indeed . Their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than I can express . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Ah ! poor dear , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Yes , ma'am . ""--She"
Mrs. Jennings	""" Then , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" he has acted like an honest man ! I beg your pardon , Mr. Dashwood , but if he had done otherwise , I should have thought him a rascal . I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Well , sir , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" and how did it end ? """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Poor young man!--and what is to become of him ? """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Poor young man ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him . It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Well ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" that is HER revenge . Everybody has a way of their own . But I do n't think mine would be , to make one son independent , because another had plagued me . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Get it all out of her , my dear . She will tell you any thing if you ask . You see I can not leave Mrs. Clarke . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Wait for his having a living!--ay , we all know how THAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth , and finding no good comes of it , will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a - year , with the interest of his two thousand pounds , and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her.--Then they will have a child every year ! and Lord help 'em ! how poor they will be!--I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house . Two maids and two men , indeed!--as I talked of t'other day.--No , no , they must get a stout girl of all works.-- Betty 's sister would never do for them NOW . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Cleveland!""--she"
Mrs. Jennings	""" No , I can not go to Cleveland . ""--"
Mrs. Jennings	""" But it is in Somersetshire.--I can not go into Somersetshire.--There , where I looked forward to going ... No , Elinor , you can not expect me to go there . """
Mrs. Jennings	"settled--""for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back!--Lord ! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Lord ! what should hinder it?""--but"
Mrs. Jennings	""" This is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Well , Miss Dashwood , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you ; for though , upon my honour , I TRIED to keep out of hearing , I could not help catching enough to understand his business . And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life , and I wish you joy of it with all my heart . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Lord ! my dear , you are very modest . I an't the least astonished at it in the world , for I have often thought of late , there was nothing more likely to happen . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Oh ! very well , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy , for I think of going as far as Holborn to - day . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Oh , ho!--I understand you . Mr. Ferrars is to be the man . Well , so much the better for him . Ay , to be sure , he must be ordained in readiness ; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you . But , my dear , is not this rather out of character ? Should not the Colonel write himself?--sure , he is the proper person . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" No , ma'am ; THAT was not very likely . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Two or three months ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Lord ! my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months ! Lord bless me!--I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars , I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him . Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Lord bless you , my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars ! """
Mrs. Jennings	""" Aye , aye , the parsonage is but a small one , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" and very likely MAY be out of repair ; but to hear a man apologising , as I thought , for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground - floor , and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!-- and to you too , that had been used to live in Barton cottage!-- It seems quite ridiculous . But , my dear , we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before Lucy goes to it . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" The Colonel is a ninny , my dear ; because he has two thousand a - year himself , he thinks that nobody else can marry on less . Take my word for it , that , if I am alive , I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas ; and I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy an't there . """
Mrs. Jennings	""" I do think , """
Mrs. Jennings	""" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again . And I must say that Lucy 's crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all . Poor Mr. Edward ! I can not get him out of my head , but you must send for him to Barton , and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Certainly , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" But , however , ONE thing must be considered . When your father and mother moved to Norland , though the furniture of Stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother . Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house . A great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place THEY can ever afford to live in . But , however , so it is . Your father thought only of THEM . And I must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" It is enough , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough . It implies everything amiable . I love him already . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" In a few months , my dear Marianne . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Elinor will , in all probability be settled for life . We shall miss her ; but SHE will be happy . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Oh ! Mamma , how shall we do without her ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" My love , it will be scarcely a separation . We shall live within a few miles of each other , and shall meet every day of our lives . You will gain a brother , a real , affectionate brother . I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward 's heart . But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister 's choice ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose . I thought so at the time ; but you WOULD give him Cowper . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Remember , my love , that you are not seventeen . It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness . Why should you be less fortunate than your mother ? In one circumstance only , my Marianne , may your destiny be different from her 's ! """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" As for the house itself , to be sure , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . Perhaps in the spring , if I have plenty of money , as I dare say I shall , we may think about building . These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here ; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . I could wish the stairs were handsome . But one must not expect every thing ; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . I shall see how much I am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" But at least , Mamma , you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill - natured . Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings , but he is old enough to be MY father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlived every sensation of the kind . It is too ridiculous ! When is a man to be safe from such wit , if age and infirmity will not protect him ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism ? and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Mamma , you are not doing me justice . I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature . He may live twenty years longer . But thirty - five has nothing to do with matrimony . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Had you any idea of his coming so soon ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I had none . On the contrary , if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject , it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation , when I talked of his coming to Barton . Does Elinor expect him already ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I rather think you are mistaken , for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" You know him then , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I do not believe , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him . It is not an employment to which they have been brought up . Men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich . I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I do not ask you to come in the morning , for we must walk to the park , to call on Lady Middleton . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Is anything the matter with her ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	"entered--""is she ill ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Disappointment ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" To London!--and are you going this morning ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" This is very unfortunate . But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from us long I hope . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I have only to add , my dear Willoughby , that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for I will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith ; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Remember , Elinor , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post , and carries them to it . We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary , and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through Sir John 's hands . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" We have never finished Hamlet , Marianne ; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it . We will put it by , that when he comes again ... But it may be months , perhaps , before THAT happens . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" What are Mrs. Ferrars 's views for you at present , Edward ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" But how is your fame to be established ? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family ; and with no inclination for expense , no affection for strangers , no profession , and no assurance , you may find it a difficult matter . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" You have no ambition , I well know . Your wishes are all moderate . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" if my children were all to be rich my help . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I love to be reminded of the past , Edward -- whether it be melancholy or gay , I love to recall it -- and you will never offend me by talking of former times . You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent -- some of it , at least -- my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" No , Edward , I should have something else to do with it . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Undoubtedly . At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed . It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" She is only grown a little more grave than she was . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I think , Edward , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions . Some inconvenience to your friends , indeed , might result from it -- you would not be able to give them so much of your time . But ( with a smile ) you would be materially benefited in one particular at least -- you would know where to go when you left them . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" The consequence of which , I suppose , will be , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" since leisure has not promoted your own happiness , that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits , employments , professions , and trades as Columella 's . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Come , come ; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits , Edward . You are in a melancholy humour , and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy . But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times , whatever be their education or state . Know your own happiness . You want nothing but patience -- or give it a more fascinating name , call it hope . Your mother will secure to you , in time , that independence you are so anxious for ; it is her duty , and it will , it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent . How much may not a few months do ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I am delighted with the plan , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" it is exactly what I could wish . Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves . When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music ! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again ! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one . It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London . You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt . And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" And what , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward ? Do let me hear a word about the expense of it . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I will have you BOTH go , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" these objections are nonsensical . You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law 's family . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" If he would only have done as well by himself , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing . But as it is , it must be out of anybody 's power to assist him . And there is one thing more preparing against him , which must be worse than all -- his mother has determined , with a very natural kind of spirit , to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately , which might have been Edward 's , on proper conditions . I left her this morning with her lawyer , talking over the business . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own ? Poor Edward ! I feel for him sincerely . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Ah ! Elinor , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" your reasoning is very good , but it is founded on ignorance of human nature . When Edward 's unhappy match takes place , depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him ; and , therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event , must be concealed from her as much as possible . Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" You wrong her exceedingly . Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" At Delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about THAT;--and though I neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , I am sure it must be a good one . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Rather say your mother 's imprudence , my child , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" SHE must be answerable . """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward , and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject , but conclude him to be still at Oxford ; """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married , Thomas ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" But did she tell you she was married , Thomas ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her ? """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" I will not say that I am disappointed , my dear sister , """
Mrs. Dashwood	""" THAT would be saying too much , for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world , as it is . But , I confess , it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother . His property here , his place , his house , every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire , as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though , perhaps , Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him-- yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you , for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home , nobody can tell what may happen -- for , when people are much thrown together , and see little of anybody else -- and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage , and so forth;-- in short , you may as well give her a chance -- You understand me . ""--"
Colonel Brandon	""" Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments . """
Colonel Brandon	""" her opinions are all romantic . """
Colonel Brandon	""" Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist . """
Colonel Brandon	""" I believe she does . But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , I know not . A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . """
Colonel Brandon	""" This will probably be the case , """
Colonel Brandon	""" and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions . """
Colonel Brandon	""" Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? """
Colonel Brandon	""" Upon my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment 's being pardonable . """
Colonel Brandon	""" This , """
Colonel Brandon	""" can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments -- No , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! I speak from experience . I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an inforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances""--"
Colonel Brandon	""" Well , then , when will you come back again ? """
Colonel Brandon	""" You are very obliging . But it is so uncertain , when I may have it in my power to return , that I dare not engage for it at all . """
Colonel Brandon	""" I do not want to pry into other men 's concerns . I suppose it is something he is ashamed of . """
Colonel Brandon	""" When do you go back again ? """
Colonel Brandon	""" Perhaps , then , """
Colonel Brandon	""" what I heard this morning may be -- there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first . """
Colonel Brandon	""" That a gentleman , whom I had reason to think -- in short , that a man , whom I KNEW to be engaged -- but how shall I tell you ? If you know it already , as surely you must , I may be spared . """
Colonel Brandon	""" In a stationer 's shop in Pall Mall , where I had business . Two ladies were waiting for their carriage , and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match , in a voice so little attempting concealment , that it was impossible for me not to hear all . The name of Willoughby , John Willoughby , frequently repeated , first caught my attention ; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey -- it was no longer to be a secret -- it would take place even within a few weeks , with many particulars of preparations and other matters . One thing , especially , I remember , because it served to identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony was over , they were to go to Combe Magna , his seat in Somersetshire . My astonishment!--but it would be impossible to describe what I felt . The communicative lady I learnt , on inquiry , for I stayed in the shop till they were gone , was a Mrs. Ellison , and that , as I have been since informed , is the name of Miss Grey 's guardian . """
Colonel Brandon	""" It may be so ; but Willoughby is capable -- at least I think""--he"
Colonel Brandon	""" And your sister-- how did she-- """
Colonel Brandon	""" Ah ! """
Colonel Brandon	""" there is , indeed ! But your sister does not -- I think you said so -- she does not consider quite as you do ? """
Colonel Brandon	""" You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . """
Colonel Brandon	""" I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street , """
Colonel Brandon	""" Such , """
Colonel Brandon	""" has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter ! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust ! """
Colonel Brandon	""" Is she still in town ? """
Colonel Brandon	""" No ; as soon as she recovered from her lying - in , for I found her near her delivery , I removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains . """
Colonel Brandon	""" I am afraid it can not take place very soon . """
Colonel Brandon	""" infection """
Colonel Brandon	""" I have heard , """
Colonel Brandon	""" of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?-- """
Colonel Brandon	""" This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it can not enable him to marry . I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive . If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present . What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness . His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least , I am afraid it can not take place very soon.-- """
Sir John Middleton	""" Willoughby ! """
Sir John Middleton	""" what , is HE in the country ? That is good news however ; I will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on Thursday . """
Sir John Middleton	""" Know him ! to be sure I do . Why , he is down here every year . """
Sir John Middleton	""" And what sort of a young man is he ? """
Sir John Middleton	""" As good a kind of fellow as ever lived , I assure you . A very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in England . """
Sir John Middleton	""" Upon my soul , """
Sir John Middleton	""" I do not know much about him as to all THAT . But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw . Was she out with him today ? """
Sir John Middleton	""" Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . """
Sir John Middleton	""" He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived , """
Sir John Middleton	""" I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o'clock till four , without once sitting down . """
Sir John Middleton	""" Aye , aye , I see how it will be , """
Sir John Middleton	""" I see how it will be . You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon . """
Sir John Middleton	""" Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other . Poor Brandon ! he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles . """
Sir John Middleton	""" What is the matter with Brandon ? """
Sir John Middleton	""" We must go , """
Sir John Middleton	"John.--""It shall not be put off when we are so near it . You can not go to town till tomorrow , Brandon , that is all . """
Sir John Middleton	""" I wish it could be so easily settled . But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day ! """
Sir John Middleton	""" I can not afford to lose ONE hour . ""--"
Sir John Middleton	""" There is no persuading you to change your mind , Brandon , I know of old , """
Sir John Middleton	""" when once you are determined on anything . But , however , I hope you will think better of it . Consider , here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton , the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to Whitwell . """
Sir John Middleton	""" Oh ! he must and shall come back , """
Sir John Middleton	""" If he is not here by the end of the week , I shall go after him . """
Sir John Middleton	""" You do not go to town on horseback , do you ? """
Sir John Middleton	""" No . Only to Honiton . I shall then go post . """
Sir John Middleton	""" I assure you it is not in my power . """
Sir John Middleton	""" You MUST drink tea with us to night , """
Sir John Middleton	""" for we shall be quite alone -- and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us , for we shall be a large party . """
Sir John Middleton	""" I wish with all my soul , """
Sir John Middleton	""" that Willoughby were among us again . """
Sir John Middleton	""" And who is Willoughby ? """
Sir John Middleton	""" Well , """
Sir John Middleton	""" we have brought you some strangers . How do you like them ? """
Sir John Middleton	""" Never mind if they do . It is only the Palmers . Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you . You may see her if you look this way . """
Sir John Middleton	""" Here comes Marianne , """
Sir John Middleton	""" Now , Palmer , you shall see a monstrous pretty girl . """
Sir John Middleton	""" I am afraid , Miss Marianne , """
Sir John Middleton	""" you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today . """
Sir John Middleton	""" My dear , """
Sir John Middleton	""" it is very provoking that we should be so few . Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today ? """
Sir John Middleton	""" His name is Ferrars , """
Sir John Middleton	""" but pray do not tell it , for it 's a great secret . """
Sir John Middleton	""" I have a notion , """
Sir John Middleton	""" that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it . It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because Miss Dashwood does not wish it . So I would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of Barton , without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it . """
Sir John Middleton	""" A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well ! Such a good - natured fellow ! He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England ! It was an unaccountable business . He wished him at the devil with all his heart . He would not speak another word to him , meet him where he might , for all the world ! No , not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert , and they were kept watching for two hours together . Such a scoundrel of a fellow ! such a deceitful dog ! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly 's puppies ! and this was the end of it ! """
Sir John Middleton	""" Poor Marianne ! """
Sir John Middleton	""" She has not such good health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor 's constitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions . You would not think it perhaps , but Marianne WAS remarkably handsome a few months ago ; quite as handsome as Elinor.-- Now you see it is all gone . """
Lady Middleton	""" I hope he has had no bad news , """
Lady Middleton	""" It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly . """
Lady Middleton	""" None at all , ma'am , I thank you . """
Lady Middleton	""" Was it from Avignon ? I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse . """
Lady Middleton	""" No , ma'am . It came from town , and is merely a letter of business . """
Lady Middleton	""" But how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ? Come , come , this wo n't do , Colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it . """
Lady Middleton	""" My dear madam , """
Lady Middleton	""" recollect what you are saying . """
Lady Middleton	""" No , indeed , it is not . """
Lady Middleton	""" Well , then , I know who it is from , Colonel . And I hope she is well . """
Lady Middleton	""" Oh ! you know who I mean . """
Lady Middleton	""" John is in such spirits today ! """
Lady Middleton	""" How playful William is ! """
Lady Middleton	""" And here is my sweet little Annamaria , """
Lady Middleton	""" And she is always so gentle and quiet -- Never was there such a quiet little thing ! """
Lady Middleton	""" I am glad , """
Lady Middleton	""" you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria 's basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight . And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to - morrow , and then I hope she will not much mind it . """
Lady Middleton	""" You are very good , I hope it wo n't hurt your eyes-- will you ring the bell for some working candles ? My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed , I know , if the basket was not finished tomorrow , for though I told her it certainly would not , I am sure she depends upon having it done . """
Lady Middleton	""" You are very kind , """
Lady Middleton	""" and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ? """
Lady Middleton	""" It is very shocking , indeed ! """
Lady Middleton	""" I hope we shall see you at Barton , """
Lady Middleton	""" as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return . """
Robert Ferrars	""" Upon my soul , """
Robert Ferrars	""" I believe it is nothing more ; and so I often tell my mother , when she is grieving about it . ' My dear Madam , ' I always say to her , ' you must make yourself easy . The evil is now irremediable , and it has been entirely your own doing . Why would you be persuaded by my uncle , Sir Robert , against your own judgment , to place Edward under private tuition , at the most critical time of his life ? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself , instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt 's , all this would have been prevented . ' This is the way in which I always consider the matter , and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error . """
Robert Ferrars	"observation.--""And THAT , """
Robert Ferrars	""" might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began . And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour . Other designs might afterward arise . """
Robert Ferrars	""" DEAR SIR ,"
Robert Ferrars	""" Being very sure I have long lost your affections , I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another , and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you ; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another 's . Sincerely wish you happy in your choice , and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends , as our near relationship now makes proper . I can safely say I owe you no ill - will , and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices . Your brother has gained my affections entirely , and as we could not live without one another , we are just returned from the altar , and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks , which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see , but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines , and shall always remain ,"
Robert Ferrars	""" Your sincere well - wisher , friend , and sister , """
Robert Ferrars	""" I have burnt all your letters , and will return your picture the first opportunity . Please to destroy my scrawls -- but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep . """
Robert Ferrars	""" I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition , """
Robert Ferrars	"Edward.--""For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU in former days.--In a sister it is bad enough , but in a wife!--how I have blushed over the pages of her writing!--and I believe I may say that since the first half year of our foolish -- business -- this is the only letter I ever received from her , of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style . """
Robert Ferrars	"pause,--""they are certainly married . And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment . The independence she settled on Robert , through resentment against you , has put it in his power to make his own choice ; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a - year , to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do . She will hardly be less hurt , I suppose , by Robert 's marrying Lucy , than she would have been by your marrying her . """
Thomas Palmer	""" No , none at all , """
Thomas Palmer	""" As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life , """
Thomas Palmer	""" Then you would be very ill - bred , """
Thomas Palmer	""" No , """
Thomas Palmer	""" I never said any thing so irrational . Do n't palm all your abuses of languages upon me . """
Thomas Palmer	""" I thought you were both in Devonshire , """
Mrs. Ferrars	""" Dear , dear Elinor , do n't mind them . Do n't let them make YOU unhappy . """
Charlotte Palmer	""" Well ! what a delightful room this is ! I never saw anything so charming ! Only think , Mamma , how it is improved since I was here last ! I always thought it such a sweet place , ma'am ! ( turning to Mrs. Dashwood ) but you have made it so charming ! Only look , sister , how delightful every thing is ! How I should like such a house for myself ! Should not you , Mr. Palmer ? """
Charlotte Palmer	""" Mr. Palmer does not hear me , """
Charlotte Palmer	""" he never does sometimes . It is so ridiculous ! """
Charlotte Palmer	""" Oh ! dear , how beautiful these are ! Well ! how delightful ! Do but look , mama , how sweet ! I declare they are quite charming ; I could look at them for ever . """
Charlotte Palmer	""" I am so glad to see you ! """
Charlotte Palmer	""" for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come , which would be a shocking thing , as we go away again tomorrow . We must go , for the Westons come to us next week you know . It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all , and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door , and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton . He is so droll ! He never tells me any thing ! I am so sorry we can not stay longer ; however we shall meet again in town very soon , I hope . """
Charlotte Palmer	""" Not go to town ! """
Charlotte Palmer	""" I shall be quite disappointed if you do not . I could get the nicest house in world for you , next door to ours , in Hanover - square . You must come , indeed . I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined , if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public . """
Charlotte Palmer	""" Oh , my love , """
Charlotte Palmer	"room--""you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter . """
Charlotte Palmer	""" Oh , do n't be so sly before us , """
Charlotte Palmer	""" for we know all about it , I assure you ; and I admire your taste very much , for I think he is extremely handsome . We do not live a great way from him in the country , you know . Not above ten miles , I dare say . """
Charlotte Palmer	""" Ah , well ! there is not much difference . I never was at his house ; but they say it is a sweet pretty place . """
Charlotte Palmer	""" Oh , my dear Miss Dashwood , """
Charlotte Palmer	""" I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister . Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas ? Now , pray do,--and come while the Westons are with us . You can not think how happy I shall be ! It will be quite delightful!--My love , """
Charlotte Palmer	""" do n't you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland ? """
Charlotte Palmer	""" Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you , """
Charlotte Palmer	""" What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mamma ? I forget what it was now , but it was something so droll ! """
Charlotte Palmer	""" She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all . She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was . """
Charlotte Palmer	""" No , ma'am . What is it ? """
Charlotte Palmer	""" What ! is Fanny ill ? """
Charlotte Palmer	""" Mr. Palmer is so droll ! """
Charlotte Palmer	""" He is always out of humour . """
Charlotte Palmer	""" How charming it will be , """
Charlotte Palmer	""" when he is in Parliament!--won't it ? How I shall laugh ! It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.--But do you know , he says , he will never frank for me ? He declares he wo n't . Do n't you , Mr. Palmer ? """
Charlotte Palmer	""" He can not bear writing , you know , """
Charlotte Palmer	""" he says it is quite shocking . """
Charlotte Palmer	""" There now ; you see how droll he is . This is always the way with him ! Sometimes he wo n't speak to me for half a day together , and then he comes out with something so droll -- all about any thing in the world . """
Fanny Dashwood	""" They are very pretty , ma'am -- an't they ? """
Fanny Dashwood	""" Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton 's style of painting , Ma'am?--She DOES paint most delightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done ! """
Fanny Dashwood	""" Beautifully indeed ! But SHE does every thing well . """
Fanny Dashwood	""" This is admiration of a very particular kind!-- what is Miss Morton to us?--who knows , or who cares , for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak . """
Fanny Dashwood	""" Miss Morton is Lord Morton 's daughter . """
Fanny Dashwood	""" I do not see how it can be done , """
Fanny Dashwood	""" without affronting Lady Middleton , for they spend every day with her ; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it . You know I am always ready to pay them any attention in my power , as my taking them out this evening shews . But they are Lady Middleton 's visitors . How can I ask them away from her ? """
Fanny Dashwood	""" My love I would ask them with all my heart , if it was in my power . But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us . They are very well behaved , good kind of girls ; and I think the attention is due to them , as their uncle did so very well by Edward . We can ask your sisters some other year , you know ; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more . I am sure you will like them ; indeed , you DO like them , you know , very much already , and so does my mother ; and they are such favourites with Harry ! """
John Dashwood	""" It is certainly an unpleasant thing , """
John Dashwood	""" to have those kind of yearly drains on one 's income . One 's fortune , as your mother justly says , is NOT one 's own . To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one 's independence . """
John Dashwood	""" I believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should by no annuity in the case ; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year . It will certainly be much the best way . A present of fifty pounds , now and then , will prevent their ever being distressed for money , and will , I think , be amply discharging my promise to my father . """
John Dashwood	""" Upon my word , """
John Dashwood	""" I believe you are perfectly right . My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say . I clearly understand it now , and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described . When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can . Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then . """
John Dashwood	""" That is a material consideration undoubtedly . A valuable legacy indeed ! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here . """
John Dashwood	""" but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where . """
John Dashwood	""" Yes ; he has very good property in Dorsetshire . """
John Dashwood	""" Me , brother ! what do you mean ? """
John Dashwood	""" I believe about two thousand a year . """
John Dashwood	""" I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny , """
John Dashwood	""" Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman ! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know . And Mrs. Jennings too , an exceedingly well - behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter . Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with . But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both . """
John Dashwood	""" We think NOW,""--said"
John Dashwood	""" of ROBERT 'S marrying Miss Morton . """
John Dashwood	""" Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward 's name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a line has been received from him on the occasion . Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars 's heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children . """
John Dashwood	""" Yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome ! It would be enough to make them completely easy . Three thousand pounds ! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience . ""--"
Margaret Dashwood	""" Oh , Elinor ! """
Margaret Dashwood	""" I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne . I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon . """
Margaret Dashwood	""" But indeed this is quite another thing . I am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair . """
Margaret Dashwood	""" But , indeed , Elinor , it is Marianne 's . I am almost sure it is , for I saw him cut it off . Last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket - book . """
Margaret Dashwood	""" I must not tell , may I , Elinor ? """
Margaret Dashwood	""" I never had any conjectures about it , """
Margaret Dashwood	""" it was you who told me of it yourself . """
Margaret Dashwood	""" I wish , """
Margaret Dashwood	""" that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece ! """
Margaret Dashwood	""" Oh dear ! """
Margaret Dashwood	""" how happy I should be ! I wonder what I should do with it ! """
