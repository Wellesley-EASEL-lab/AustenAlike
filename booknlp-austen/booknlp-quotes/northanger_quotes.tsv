Character	Quote
Catherine Morland	“ How uncomfortable it is , ”
Catherine Morland	“ not to have a single acquaintance here ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ What shall we do ? The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here — we seem forcing ourselves into their party . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I wish we had _ any;_—it would be somebody to go to . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Had not we better go away as it is ? Here are no tea - things for us , you see . ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , indeed , it looks very nice . But , dear Mrs. Allen , are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people ? I think you _ must _ know somebody . ”
Catherine Morland	“ About a week , sir , ”
Catherine Morland	“ I have sometimes thought , ”
Catherine Morland	“ whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen ! that is — I should not think the superiority was always on our side . ”
Catherine Morland	“ And what are they ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Upon my word ! i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment . You do not think too highly of us in that way . ”
Catherine Morland	“ How can you , ”
Catherine Morland	“ be so — ”
Catherine Morland	“ I was not thinking of anything . ”
Catherine Morland	“ That is artful and deep , to be sure ; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Well then , I will not . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Thank you ; for now we shall soon be acquainted , as I am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet , and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Oh , dear ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ How can you say so ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I know you very well ; you have so much animation , which is exactly what Miss Andrews wants , for I must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her . Oh ! i must tell you , that just after we parted yesterday , I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly — I am sure he is in love with you . ”
Catherine Morland	seriously—“your feelings are easily understood . Where the heart is really attached , I know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else . Everything is so insipid , so uninteresting , that does not relate to the beloved object ! i can perfectly comprehend your feelings . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Not see him again ! my dearest creature , do not talk of it . I am sure you would be miserable if you thought so ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ It is so odd to me , that you should never have read Udolpho before ; but I suppose Mrs. Morland objects to novels . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Sir Charles Grandison ! that is an amazing horrid book , is it not ? I remember Miss Andrews could not get through the first volume . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Do you indeed ! you surprise me ; I thought it had not been readable . But , my dearest Catherine , have you settled what to wear on your head to - night ? I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you . The men take notice of _ that _ sometimes , you know . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But it does not signify if they do , ”
Catherine Morland	“ Signify ! oh , heavens ! i make it a rule never to mind what they say . They are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit , and make them keep their distance . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Are they ? Well , I never observed _ that _ . They always behave very well to me . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Oh ! they give themselves such airs . They are the most conceited creatures in the world , and think themselves of so much importance ! by the by , though I have thought of it a hundred times , I have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man . Do you like them best dark or fair ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I hardly know . I never much thought about it . Something between both , I think . Brown — not fair , and — and not very dark . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Very well , Catherine . That is exactly he . I have not forgot your description of Mr. Tilney—‘a brown skin , with dark eyes , and rather dark hair . ’ Well , my taste is different . I prefer light eyes , and as to complexion — do you know — I like a sallow better than any other . You must not betray me , if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Betray you ! what do you mean ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Nay , do not distress me . I believe I have said too much . Let us drop the subject . ”
Catherine Morland	“ They are not coming this way , are they ? I hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us . Pray let me know if they are coming . I am determined I will not look up . ”
Catherine Morland	“ They went towards the church - yard . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Oh ! never mind that . If we make haste , we shall pass by them presently , and I am dying to show you my hat . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I shall not pay them any such compliment , I assure you . I have no notion of treating men with such respect . _ That _ is the way to spoil them . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Good heaven ! ’ Tis James ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ And I am sure , ”
Catherine Morland	“ I know so little of such things that I can not judge whether it was cheap or dear . ”
Catherine Morland	“ That was very good - natured of you , ”
Catherine Morland	“ Thank you , ”
Catherine Morland	“ Shall you indeed ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ That will be forty miles a day . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe , ”
Catherine Morland	“ Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head , ”
Catherine Morland	“ It is Mr. Tilney ’s sister . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But what is all this whispering about ? What is going on ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ And is that likely to satisfy me , do you think ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Where can he be ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ What do you mean ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Where are you all going to ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Something was said about it , I remember , ”
Catherine Morland	“ but really I did not expect you . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , it does give a notion , ”
Catherine Morland	“ and that is , that you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did . However , I am sure James does not drink so much . ”
Catherine Morland	“ You do not really think , Mr. Thorpe , ”
Catherine Morland	“ that James ’s gig will break down ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Break down ! oh , lord ! did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life ? There is not a sound piece of iron about it . The wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least — and as for the body ! upon my soul , you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch . It is the most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld ! thank God ! we have got a better . I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Good heavens ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ Then pray let us turn back ; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on . Do let us turn back , Mr. Thorpe ; stop and speak to my brother , and tell him how very unsafe it is . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Unsafe ! oh , lord ! what is there in that ? They will only get a roll if it does break down ; and there is plenty of dirt ; it will be excellent falling . Oh , curse it ! the carriage is safe enough , if a man knows how to drive it ; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn out . Lord bless you ! i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to York and back again , without losing a nail . ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , ”
Catherine Morland	“ he is not here ; I can not see him anywhere . ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , indeed I should not . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Indeed you do me injustice ; I would not have made so improper a remark upon any account ; and besides , I am sure it would never have entered my head . ”
Catherine Morland	“ You can not think , ”
Catherine Morland	“ how surprised I was to see him again . I felt so sure of his being quite gone away . ”
Catherine Morland	“ _ That _ never occurred to me ; and of course , not seeing him anywhere , I thought he must be gone . Was not the young lady he danced with on Monday a Miss Smith ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I dare say she was very glad to dance . Do you think her pretty ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ He never comes to the pump - room , I suppose ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon , ”
Catherine Morland	“ Shall you be at the cotillion ball to - morrow ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am glad of it , for we shall all be there . ”
Catherine Morland	“ By heavens , if they do not , I will kick them out of the room for blockheads . What chap have you there ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Tilney , ”
Catherine Morland	“ Hum — I do not know him . A good figure of a man ; well put together . Does he want a horse ? Here is a friend of mine , Sam Fletcher , has got one to sell that would suit anybody . A famous clever animal for the road — only forty guineas . I had fifty minds to buy it myself , for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when I meet with one ; but it would not answer my purpose , it would not do for the field . I would give any money for a real good hunter . I have three now , the best that ever were backed . I would not take eight hundred guineas for them . Fletcher and I mean to get a house in Leicestershire , against the next season . It is so d — — uncomfortable , living at an inn . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Oh!”—but
Catherine Morland	“ Oh ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ No walk for me to - day , ”
Catherine Morland	“ but perhaps it may come to nothing , or it may hold up before twelve . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Oh ! that will not signify ; I never mind dirt . ”
Catherine Morland	“ It comes on faster and faster ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ So it does indeed . If it keeps raining , the streets will be very wet . ”
Catherine Morland	“ There are four umbrellas up already . How I hate the sight of an umbrella ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ They are disagreeable things to carry . I would much rather take a chair at any time . ”
Catherine Morland	“ It was such a nice - looking morning ! i felt so convinced it would be dry ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ Anybody would have thought so indeed . There will be very few people in the pump - room , if it rains all the morning . I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes , but I dare say he will not , for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat ; I wonder he should dislike it , it must be so comfortable . ”
Catherine Morland	“ You will not be able to go , my dear . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I do not quite despair yet . I shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve . This is just the time of day for it to clear up , and I do think it looks a little lighter . There , it is twenty minutes after twelve , and now I _ shall _ give it up entirely . Oh ! that we had such weather here as they had at Udolpho , or at least in Tuscany and the south of France!—the night that poor St. Aubin died!—such beautiful weather ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ I doubt our being able to do so much , ”
Catherine Morland	“ Blaize Castle ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ What is that ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ What , is it really a castle , an old castle ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ But is it like what one reads of ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ But now really — are there towers and long galleries ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Then I should like to see it ; but I cannot — I can not go . ”
Catherine Morland	“ We had better go back , Thorpe ; it is too late to go on to - day ; your sister thinks so as well as I. We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street , very little more than seven miles ; and , I suppose , we have at least eight more to go . It will never do . We set out a great deal too late . We had much better put it off till another day , and turn round . ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , he is not , ”
Catherine Morland	“ for I am sure he could not afford it . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Because he has not money enough . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Mrs. Allen , ”
Catherine Morland	“ will there be any harm in my calling on Miss Tilney to - day ? I shall not be easy till I have explained everything . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Go , by all means , my dear ; only put on a white gown ; Miss Tilney always wears white . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Oh , do not say Miss Tilney was not angry , ”
Catherine Morland	“ because I know she was ; for she would not see me this morning when I called ; I saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it ; I was hurt , but I was not affronted . Perhaps you did not know I had been there . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Do not urge me , Isabella . I am engaged to Miss Tilney . I can not go . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Nay , Catherine . I think you can not stand out any longer now . The sacrifice is not much ; and to oblige such a friend — I shall think you quite unkind , if you still refuse . ”
Catherine Morland	“ You have not ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ This will not do , ”
Catherine Morland	“ I can not submit to this . I must run after Miss Tilney directly and set her right . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Then I will go after them , ”
Catherine Morland	“ wherever they are I will go after them . It does not signify talking . If I could not be persuaded into doing what I thought wrong , I never will be tricked into it . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Let her go , let her go , if she will go . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Dear madam , ”
Catherine Morland	“ then why did not you tell me so before ? I am sure if I had known it to be improper , I would not have gone with Mr. Thorpe at all ; but I always hoped you would tell me , if you thought I was doing wrong . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But this was something of real consequence ; and I do not think you would have found me hard to persuade . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I never look at it , ”
Catherine Morland	“ without thinking of the south of France . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Oh ! no , I only mean what I have read about . It always puts me in mind of the country that Emily and her father travelled through , in The Mysteries of Udolpho . But you never read novels , I dare say ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Why not ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Because they are not clever enough for you — gentlemen read better books . ”
Catherine Morland	“ The person , be it gentleman or lady , who has not pleasure in a good novel , must be intolerably stupid . I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe ’s works , and most of them with great pleasure . The Mysteries of Udolpho , when I had once begun it , I could not lay down again ; I remember finishing it in two days — my hair standing on end the whole time . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Thank you , Eleanor — a most honourable testimony . You see , Miss Morland , the injustice of your suspicions . Here was I , in my eagerness to get on , refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister , breaking the promise I had made of reading it aloud , and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part , by running away with the volume , which , you are to observe , was her own , particularly her own . I am proud when I reflect on it , and I think it must establish me in your good opinion . ”
Catherine Morland	“ It is _ amazingly ; _ it may well suggest _ amazement _ if they do — for they read nearly as many as women . I myself have read hundreds and hundreds . Do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of Julias and Louisas . If we proceed to particulars , and engage in the never - ceasing inquiry of ‘ Have you read this ? ’ and ‘ Have you read that ? ’ I shall soon leave you as far behind me as — what shall I say?—I want an appropriate simile.—as far as your friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt when she went with her aunt into Italy . Consider how many years I have had the start of you . I had entered on my studies at Oxford , while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ The nicest — by which I suppose you mean the neatest . That must depend upon the binding . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am sure , ”
Catherine Morland	“ I did not mean to say anything wrong ; but it _ is _ a nice book , and why should not I call it so ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ To say the truth , I do not much like any other . ”
Catherine Morland	“ That is , I can read poetry and plays , and things of that sort , and do not dislike travels . But history , real solemn history , I can not be interested in . Can you ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I wish I were too . I read it a little as a duty , but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me . The quarrels of popes and kings , with wars or pestilences , in every page ; the men all so good for nothing , and hardly any women at all — it is very tiresome : and yet I often think it odd that it should be so dull , for a great deal of it must be invention . The speeches that are put into the heroes ’ mouths , their thoughts and designs — the chief of all this must be invention , and invention is what delights me in other books . ”
Catherine Morland	“ You are fond of history ! and so are Mr. Allen and my father ; and I have two brothers who do not dislike it . So many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable ! at this rate , I shall not pity the writers of history any longer . If people like to read their books , it is all very well , but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes , which , as I used to think , nobody would willingly ever look into , to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls , always struck me as a hard fate ; and though I know it is all very right and necessary , I have often wondered at the person ’s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it . ”
Catherine Morland	“ You think me foolish to call instruction a torment , but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell , if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together , and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it , as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home , you would allow that to _ torment _ and to _ instruct _ might sometimes be used as synonymous words . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in London . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I wish you could have gone too . It is a pity you could not all go . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Richmond ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ You must settle near Fullerton . You must be near us . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Shall not you be late at Devizes ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Then why do you stay away so long ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am very sorry for it , ”
Catherine Morland	“ if I had known this before — ”
Catherine Morland	“ Do not be uneasy , Isabella , James will soon be here . ”
Catherine Morland	“ You shall certainly have the best in my power to give . But who are you looking for ? Are your sisters coming ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ But I thought , Isabella , you had something in particular to tell me ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , indeed , I can not . ”
Catherine Morland	“ With _ me _ , dear Isabella ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , he does not know what he is about , ”
Catherine Morland	“ he does not know the pain he is giving my brother . Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , very sure . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Is not it the same thing ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Isabella is wrong . But I am sure she can not mean to torment , for she is very much attached to my brother . She has been in love with him ever since they first met , and while my father ’s consent was uncertain , she fretted herself almost into a fever . You know she must be attached to him . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Oh no , not flirts . A woman in love with one man can not flirt with another . ”
Catherine Morland	“ It is probable that she will neither love so well , nor flirt so well , as she might do either singly . The gentlemen must each give up a little . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I can have no opinion on that subject . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But what can your brother mean ? If he knows her engagement , what can he mean by his behaviour ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ You are a very close questioner . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Am I ? I only ask what I want to be told . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , I think so ; for you must know your brother ’s heart . ”
Catherine Morland	“ My brother ’s heart , as you term it , on the present occasion , I assure you I can only guess at . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Well ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Well ! nay , if it is to be guesswork , let us all guess for ourselves . To be guided by second - hand conjecture is pitiful . The premises are before you . My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man ; he has had about a week ’s acquaintance with your friend , and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Well , ”
Catherine Morland	“ _ you _ may be able to guess at your brother ’s intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not . But is not your father uncomfortable about it ? Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away ? Sure , if your father were to speak to him , he would go . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But how can that be ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Are not you with her ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ How sorry you must be for that ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes ; but besides your affection for her , you must be so fond of the abbey ! after being used to such a home as the abbey , an ordinary parsonage - house must be very disagreeable . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Miss Tilney , she was sure , would never put her into such a chamber as he had described ! she was not at all afraid . ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , indeed , ”
Catherine Morland	“ Mr. Allen ’s dining - parlour was not more than half as large , ”
Catherine Morland	“ Is it a pretty place ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ And ought it not , ”
Catherine Morland	“ to endear it to her husband ? Yet the General would not enter it . ”
Catherine Morland	“ So much the worse ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ I have been , ”
Catherine Morland	“ to see your mother ’s room . ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , nothing at all . I thought you did not mean to come back till to - morrow . ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , I was not . You have had a very fine day for your ride . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But your father , ”
Catherine Morland	“ was _ he _ afflicted ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am very glad of it , ”
Catherine Morland	“ it would have been very shocking ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ Believe me , ”
Catherine Morland	“ I have one favour to beg , ”
Catherine Morland	“ that , if your brother should be coming here , you will give me notice of it , that I may go away . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . ”
Catherine Morland	“ How quick you are ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ you have guessed it , I declare ! And yet , when we talked about it in Bath , you little thought of its ending so . Isabella — no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her — Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours ! could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ It is very true , however ; you shall read James ’s letter yourself . Stay — There is one part — ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , read it yourself , ”
Catherine Morland	“ I do not know what I was thinking of ”
Catherine Morland	“ James only means to give me good advice . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Her mother is a very good sort of woman , ”
Catherine Morland	“ But perhaps , ”
Catherine Morland	“ though she has behaved so ill by our family , she may behave better by yours . Now she has really got the man she likes , she may be constant . ”
Catherine Morland	“ No , ”
Catherine Morland	“ I do not — ought I ? To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought . ”
Catherine Morland	“ And when do you think , sir , I may look forward to this pleasure ? I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting , and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Go away ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ And why ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Oh ! not seriously ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ But how can you think of such a thing , after what the General said ? When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble , because _ anything _ would do . ”
Catherine Morland	“ hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time — had been misled ( perhaps by her wishes ) to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised — and could not but think that if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have her there , they would be too generous to hasten her return . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Oh ! as to _ that _ , Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all . As long as she was happy , they would always be satisfied . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Then why , might she ask , in such a hurry herself to leave them ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Oh ! because she had been there so long . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Nay , if you can use such a word , I can urge you no farther . If you think it long — ”
Catherine Morland	“ Oh ! no , I do not indeed . For my own pleasure , I could stay with you as long again . ”
Catherine Morland	“ My dear Catherine , you must not — you must not indeed — ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am quite well . This kindness distracts me — I can not bear it — I come to you on such an errand ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ How shall I tell you ! oh ! how shall I tell you ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ My dear Eleanor , ”
Catherine Morland	“ do not be so distressed . A second engagement must give way to a first . I am very , very sorry we are to part — so soon , and so suddenly too ; but I am not offended , indeed I am not . I can finish my visit here , you know , at any time ; or I hope you will come to me . Can you , when you return from this lord ’s , come to Fullerton ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Come when you can , then . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I could hardly believe my senses , when I heard it ; and no displeasure , no resentment that you can feel at this moment , however justly great , can be more than I myself — but I must not talk of what I felt . Oh ! that I could suggest anything in extenuation ! good God ! what will your father and mother say ! after courting you from the protection of real friends to this — almost double distance from your home , to have you driven out of the house , without the considerations even of decent civility ! dear , dear Catherine , in being the bearer of such a message , I seem guilty myself of all its insult ; yet , I trust you will acquit me , for you must have been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress of it , that my real power is nothing . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Have I offended the General ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ they must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General Tilney . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Well , ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am glad I did not know of your journey at the time ; but now it is all over , perhaps there is no great harm done . It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves ; and you know , my dear Catherine , you always were a sad little scatter - brained creature ; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you , with so much changing of chaises and so forth ; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , but _ that _ did not last long , ”
Catherine Morland	“ her head did not run upon Bath — much . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Then you are fretting about General Tilney , and that is very simple of you ; for ten to one whether you ever see him again . You should never fret about trifles . ”
Catherine Morland	silence—“I hope , my Catherine , you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as Northanger . That would be turning your visit into an evil indeed . Wherever you are you should always be contented , but especially at home , because there you must spend the most of your time . I did not quite like , at breakfast , to hear you talk so much about the French bread at Northanger . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am sure I do not care about the bread . It is all the same to me what I eat . ”
Catherine Morland	“ There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject , about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance — The Mirror , I think . I will look it out for you some day or other , because I am sure it will do you good . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I wish you could dance , my dear — I wish you could get a partner . ”
Catherine Morland	“ It would have been very shocking to have it torn , ”
Catherine Morland	“ would not it ? It is such a delicate muslin . For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room , I assure you . ”
Catherine Morland	“ You have lost an hour , ”
Catherine Morland	“ it was only ten o’clock when we came from Tetbury . ”
Catherine Morland	“ He _ does _ look very hot , to be sure . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I am sure I can not guess at all . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , ”
Catherine Morland	“ but you forget that your horse was included . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , very ; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one ; but I am particularly fond of it . ”
Catherine Morland	“ But where are you going , Eleanor ? Why do you choose that cold , damp path to it ? Miss Morland will get wet . Our best way is across the park . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Her death must have been a great affliction ! ”
Catherine Morland	“ I was only thirteen when it happened ; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it , I did not , I could not , then know what a loss it was . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I have no sister , you know — and though Henry — though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . ”
Catherine Morland	“ To be sure you must miss him very much . ”
Catherine Morland	“ A mother would have been always present . A mother would have been a constant friend ; her influence would have been beyond all other . ”
Catherine Morland	“ Was she a very charming woman ? Was she handsome ? Was there any picture of her in the abbey ? And why had she been so partial to that grove ? Was it from dejection of spirits?”—were
Catherine Morland	“ our friends from Fullerton . ”
Catherine Morland	“ I was going to take you into what was my mother ’s room — the room in which she died — ”
Catherine Morland	“ It remains as it was , I suppose ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ Yes , entirely . ”
Catherine Morland	“ And how long ago may it be that your mother died ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ She has been dead these nine years . ”
Catherine Morland	“ You were with her , I suppose , to the last ? ”
Catherine Morland	“ My father , ”
Catherine Morland	“ often walks about the room in this way ; it is nothing unusual . ”
Catherine Morland	“ quite horrid . ”
Catherine Morland	“ How glad I shall be when you are all off . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ for she must confess herself very partial to the profession ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ My dear creature , I am afraid I must leave you , your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin ; I know you will not mind my going away , and I dare say John will be back in a moment , and then you may easily find me out . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ There , ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ you hear what your sister says , and yet you will not mind her . Well , remember that it is not my fault , if we set all the old ladies in Bath in a bustle . Come along , my dearest Catherine , for heaven ’s sake , and stand by me . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ My dearest creature , ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ you have been at least three hours getting ready . I was afraid you were ill . What a delightful ball we had last night . I have a thousand things to say to you ; but make haste and get in , for I long to be off . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Henry ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Yes , he does dance very well . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Do not be frightened , my dear Catherine , ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ but I am really going to dance with your brother again . I declare positively it is quite shocking . I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself , but you and John must keep us in countenance . Make haste , my dear creature , and come to us . John is just walked off , but he will be back in a moment . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ My dearest Catherine , you can not form an idea of the dirt ; come , you must go ; you can not refuse going now . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Yes , yes , every hole and corner . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Make yourself easy , there is no danger of that , for I heard Tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback , that they were going as far as Wick Rocks . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Just as you please , my dear . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ How I pity the poor creatures that are going there ! how glad I am that I am not amongst them ! i wonder whether it will be a full ball or not ! they have not begun dancing yet . I would not be there for all the world . It is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself . I dare say it will not be a very good ball . I know the Mitchells will not be there . I am sure I pity everybody that is . But I dare say , Mr. Morland , you long to be at it , do not you ? I am sure you do . Well , pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you . I dare say we could do very well without you ; but you men think yourselves of such consequence . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Do not be so dull , my dearest creature , ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ You will quite break my heart . It was amazingly shocking , to be sure ; but the Tilneys were entirely to blame . Why were not they more punctual ? It was dirty , indeed , but what did that signify ? I am sure John and I should not have minded it . I never mind going through anything , where a friend is concerned ; that is my disposition , and John is just the same ; he has amazing strong feelings . Good heavens ! what a delightful hand you have got ! kings , I vow ! i never was so happy in my life ! i would fifty times rather you should have them than myself . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ No , it would not be easy . I could not do it . There has been no prior engagement . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I can not help being jealous , Catherine , when I see myself slighted for strangers , I , who love you so excessively ! when once my affections are placed , it is not in the power of anything to change them . But I believe my feelings are stronger than anybody ’s ; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace ; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick , I own . These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ No , no , no ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ that could not be , for Thorpe did not know that he might not go to town on Tuesday . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Very well , then there is an end of the party . If Catherine does not go , I can not . I can not be the only woman . I would not , upon any account in the world , do so improper a thing . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ But why can not Mr. Thorpe drive one of his other sisters ? I dare say either of them would like to go . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I suspect , ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ there is no great struggle . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Well , I have settled the matter , and now we may all go to - morrow with a safe conscience . I have been to Miss Tilney , and made your excuses . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I have , upon my soul . Left her this moment . Told her you had sent me to say that , having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us to - morrow , you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till Tuesday . She said very well , Tuesday was just as convenient to her ; so there is an end of all our difficulties . A pretty good thought of mine — hey ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ A most heavenly thought indeed ! now , my sweet Catherine , all our distresses are over ; you are honourably acquitted , and we shall have a most delightful party . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I am come in a great hurry — It was all a mistake — I never promised to go — I told them from the first I could not go.—I ran away in a great hurry to explain it.—I did not care what you thought of me.—I would not stay for the servant . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ No ; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it ; and therefore you know I could not go with them , could I ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Yes , very much so indeed . Open carriages are nasty things . A clean gown is not five minutes ’ wear in them . You are splashed getting in and getting out ; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction . I hate an open carriage myself . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Yes , my dear , a very odd appearance indeed . I can not bear to see it . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ And so I should , my dear , you may depend on it ; for as I told Mrs. Morland at parting , I would always do the best for you in my power . But one must not be over particular . Young people _ will _ be young people , as your good mother says herself . You know I wanted you , when we first came , not to buy that sprigged muslin , but you would . Young people do not like to be always thwarted . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Yes , my dear Catherine , it is so indeed ; your penetration has not deceived you . Oh , that arch eye of yours ! it sees through everything . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ You will be so infinitely dearer to me , my Catherine , than either Anne or Maria : I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland ’s family than to my own . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ You are so like your dear brother , ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you . But so it always is with me ; the first moment settles everything . The very first day that Morland came to us last Christmas — the very first moment I beheld him — my heart was irrecoverably gone . I remember I wore my yellow gown , with my hair done up in braids ; and when I came into the drawing - room , and John introduced him , I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Morland says exactly the same , ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ and yet I dare not expect it ; my fortune will be so small ; they never can consent to it . Your brother , who might marry anybody ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ For my own part , ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me . Where people are really attached , poverty itself is wealth ; grandeur I detest : I would not settle in London for the universe . A cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy . There are some charming little villas about Richmond . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not . If I can but be near _ you _ , I shall be satisfied . But this is idle talking ! i will not allow myself to think of such things , till we have your father ’s answer . Morland says that by sending it to - night to Salisbury , we may have it to - morrow . To - morrow ? I know I shall never have courage to open the letter . I know it will be the death of me . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents , and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness , ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ It was all pride , pride , insufferable haughtiness and pride ! she had long suspected the family to be very high , and this made it certain . Such insolence of behaviour as Miss Tilney ’s she had never heard of in her life ! not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding ! to behave to her guest with such superciliousness ! hardly even to speak to her ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ But it was not so bad as that , Isabella ; there was no superciliousness ; she was very civil . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Oh , do n’t defend her ! and then the brother , he , who had appeared so attached to you ! good heavens ! well , some people ’s feelings are incomprehensible . And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I do not say so ; but he did not seem in good spirits . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ How contemptible ! of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion . Let me entreat you never to think of him again , my dear Catherine ; indeed he is unworthy of you . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Unworthy ! i do not suppose he ever thinks of me . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ That is exactly what I say ; he never thinks of you . Such fickleness ! Oh ! how different to your brother and to mine ! i really believe John has the most constant heart . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ But as for General Tilney , I assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention ; it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Oh ! i know no harm of him ; I do not suspect him of pride . I believe he is a very gentleman - like man . John thinks very well of him , and John ’s judgment — ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Well , I shall see how they behave to me this evening ; we shall meet them at the rooms . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ And must I go ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Do not you intend it ? I thought it was all settled . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Nay , since you make such a point of it , I can refuse you nothing . But do not insist upon my being very agreeable , for my heart , you know , will be some forty miles off . And as for dancing , do not mention it , I beg ; _ that _ is quite out of the question . Charles Hodges will plague me to death , I dare say ; but I shall cut him very short . Ten to one but he guesses the reason , and that is exactly what I want to avoid , so I shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Your brother will not mind it , I know , ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ because I heard him say before that he hated dancing ; but it was very good - natured in him to think of it . I suppose he saw Isabella sitting down , and fancied she might wish for a partner ; but he is quite mistaken , for she would not dance upon any account in the world . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I do not wonder at your surprise ; and I am really fatigued to death . He is such a rattle ! amusing enough , if my mind had been disengaged ; but I would have given the world to sit still . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Oh ! my dear ! it would have looked so particular ; and you know how I abhor doing that . I refused him as long as I possibly could , but he would take no denial . You have no idea how he pressed me . I begged him to excuse me , and get some other partner — but no , not he ; after aspiring to my hand , there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of ; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance , he wanted to be with me . Oh ! such nonsense ! i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me ; for , of all things in the world , I hated fine speeches and compliments ; and so — and so then I found there would be no peace if I did not stand up . Besides , I thought Mrs. Hughes , who introduced him , might take it ill if I did not : and your dear brother , I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening . I am so glad it is over ! my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense : and then , being such a smart young fellow , I saw every eye was upon us . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Handsome ! yes , I suppose he may . I dare say people would admire him in general ; but he is not at all in my style of beauty . I hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man . However , he is very well . Amazingly conceited , I am sure . I took him down several times , you know , in my way . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ It is very charming indeed , ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ As to that , my sweet Catherine , there can not be a doubt , and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me . It is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits ; I hate money ; and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year , I should not have a wish unsatisfied . Ah ! my Catherine , you have found me out . There ’s the sting . The long , long , endless two years and a half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Are you ? Well , if you say it , it was so , I dare say — but for the life of me , I can not recollect it . I _ do _ remember now being with you , and seeing him as well as the rest — but that we were ever alone for five minutes — However , it is not worth arguing about , for whatever might pass on his side , you must be convinced , by my having no recollection of it , that I never thought , nor expected , nor wished for anything of the kind from him . I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me — but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side ; I never had the smallest idea of it . Pray undeceive him as soon as you can , and tell him I beg his pardon — that is — I do not know what I ought to say — but make him understand what I mean , in the properest way . I would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours , Isabella , I am sure ; but you know very well that if I could think of one man more than another—_he _ is not the person . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ My dear friend , you must not be angry with me . I can not suppose your brother cares so very much about me . And , you know , we shall still be sisters . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I certainly can not return his affection , and as certainly never meant to encourage it . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ You _ do _ acquit me , then , of anything wrong?—You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother , never suspected him of liking me till this moment ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Oh ! as to that , ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been . All that is best known to yourself . A little harmless flirtation or so will occur , and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by . But you may be assured that I am the last person in the world to judge you severely . All those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits . What one means one day , you know , one may not mean the next . Circumstances change , opinions alter . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ But my opinion of your brother never did alter ; it was always the same . You are describing what never happened . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Psha , nonsense ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Why do you put such things into my head ? If I could believe it — my spirit , you know , is pretty independent . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ My heart , indeed ! what can you have to do with hearts ? You men have none of you any hearts . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Do they ? I am sorry for it ; I am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me . I will look another way . I hope this pleases you ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I hope your eyes are not tormented now . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Never more so ; for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view — at once too much and too little . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Why do not you persuade him to go away ? The longer he stays , the worse it will be for him at last . Pray advise him for his own sake , and for everybody ’s sake , to leave Bath directly . Absence will in time make him comfortable again ; but he can have no hope here , and it is only staying to be miserable . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ But he will tell only half of it . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ My dearest creature , what can have made you so late ? I have been waiting for you at least this age ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Have you , indeed ! i am very sorry for it ; but really I thought I was in very good time . It is but just one . I hope you have not been here long ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Oh ! these ten ages at least . I am sure I have been here this half hour . But now , let us go and sit down at the other end of the room , and enjoy ourselves . I have an hundred things to say to you . In the first place , I was so afraid it would rain this morning , just as I wanted to set off ; it looked very showery , and that would have thrown me into agonies ! do you know , I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine , in a shop window in Milsom Street just now — very like yours , only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green ; I quite longed for it . But , my dearest Catherine , what have you been doing with yourself all this morning ? Have you gone on with Udolpho ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Yes , I have been reading it ever since I woke ; and I am got to the black veil . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Are you , indeed ? How delightful ! oh ! i would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world ! are not you wild to know ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Oh ! yes , quite ; what can it be ? But do not tell me — I would not be told upon any account . I know it must be a skeleton , I am sure it is Laurentina ’s skeleton . Oh ! i am delighted with the book ! i should like to spend my whole life in reading it . I assure you , if it had not been to meet you , I would not have come away from it for all the world . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Dear creature ! how much I am obliged to you ; and when you have finished Udolpho , we will read the Italian together ; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Have you , indeed ! how glad I am ! what are they all ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ I will read you their names directly ; here they are , in my pocketbook . Castle of Wolfenbach , Clermont , Mysterious Warnings , Necromancer of the Black Forest , Midnight Bell , Orphan of the Rhine , and Horrid Mysteries . Those will last us some time . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Yes , pretty well ; but are they all horrid , are you sure they are all horrid ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Yes , quite sure ; for a particular friend of mine , a Miss Andrews , a sweet girl , one of the sweetest creatures in the world , has read every one of them . I wish you knew Miss Andrews , you would be delighted with her . She is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive . I think her as beautiful as an angel , and I am so vexed with the men for not admiring her ! i scold them all amazingly about it . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Scold them ! do you scold them for not admiring her ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Yes , that I do . There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends . I have no notion of loving people by halves ; it is not my nature . My attachments are always excessively strong . I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night , I would not dance with him , unless he would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel . The men think us incapable of real friendship , you know , and I am determined to show them the difference . Now , if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you , I should fire up in a moment : but that is not at all likely , for _ you _ are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ It is very true , upon my honour , but I see how it is ; you are indifferent to everybody ’s admiration , except that of one gentleman , who shall be nameless . Nay , I can not blame you”—speaking
Isabella Thorpe	“ But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr. Tilney , for perhaps I may never see him again . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ No , indeed , I should not . I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him ; but while I have Udolpho to read , I feel as if nobody could make me miserable . Oh ! the dreadful black veil ! my dear Isabella , I am sure there must be Laurentina ’s skeleton behind it . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ No , she does not . She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself ; but new books do not fall in our way . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ It is not like Udolpho at all ; but yet I think it is very entertaining . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ And which way are they gone ? ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ One was a very good - looking young man . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Well , I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them ! and now , what say you to going to Edgar ’s Buildings with me , and looking at my new hat ? You said you should like to see it . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Only , ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ perhaps we may overtake the two young men . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ But if we only wait a few minutes , there will be no danger of our seeing them at all . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Oh , these odious gigs ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ How I detest them . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ Delightful ! mr . Morland and my brother ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ How delightful that will be ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ My dearest Catherine , I quite envy you ; but I am afraid , brother , you will not have room for a third . ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ _ Three_-and - twenty ! ”
Isabella Thorpe	“ five - and - twenty if it is an inch . ”
Henry Tilney	“ That is exactly what I should have guessed it , madam , ”
Henry Tilney	“ It is very pretty , madam , ”
Henry Tilney	“ but I do not think it will wash well ; I am afraid it will fray . ”
Henry Tilney	“ But then you know , madam , muslin always turns to some account or other ; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief , or a cap , or a cloak . Muslin can never be said to be wasted . I have heard my sister say so forty times , when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted , or careless in cutting it to pieces . ”
Henry Tilney	“ What are you thinking of so earnestly ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ not of your partner , I hope , for , by that shake of the head , your meditations are not satisfactory . ”
Henry Tilney	“ I am very happy to see you again , sir , indeed ; I was afraid you had left Bath . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Only go and call on Mrs. Allen ! ”
Henry Tilney	“ What a picture of intellectual poverty ! however , when you sink into this abyss again , you will have more to say . You will be able to talk of Bath , and of all that you did here . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do . But papas and mammas , and brothers , and intimate friends are a good deal gone by , to most of the frequenters of Bath — and the honest relish of balls and plays , and everyday sights , is past with them . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Oh ! mr . Tilney , I have been quite wild to speak to you , and make my apologies . You must have thought me so rude ; but indeed it was not my own fault , was it , Mrs. Allen ? Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together ? And then what could I do ? But I had ten thousand times rather have been with you ; now had not I , Mrs. Allen ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk ; I never thought of such a thing ; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop ; I called out to him as soon as ever I saw you ; now , Mrs. Allen , did not — Oh ! you were not there ; but indeed I did ; and , if Mr. Thorpe would only have stopped , I would have jumped out and run after you . ”
Henry Tilney	“ I was not within at the time ; but I heard of it from Eleanor , and she has been wishing ever since to see you , to explain the reason of such incivility ; but perhaps I can do it as well . It was nothing more than that my father — they were just preparing to walk out , and he being hurried for time , and not caring to have it put off — made a point of her being denied . That was all , I do assure you . She was very much vexed , and meant to make her apology as soon as possible . ”
Henry Tilney	“ But , Mr. Tilney , why were _ you _ less generous than your sister ? If she felt such confidence in my good intentions , and could suppose it to be only a mistake , why should _ you _ be so ready to take offence ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ Nay , I am sure by your look , when you came into the box , you were angry . ”
Henry Tilney	“ You have been abroad then ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ Very true , ”
Henry Tilney	“ and this is a very nice day , and we are taking a very nice walk , and you are two very nice young ladies . Oh ! it is a very nice word indeed ! it does for everything . Originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness , propriety , delicacy , or refinement — people were nice in their dress , in their sentiments , or their choice . But now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word . ”
Henry Tilney	“ That little boys and girls should be tormented , ”
Henry Tilney	“ is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny ; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians , I must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim , and that by their method and style , they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life . I use the verb ‘ to torment , ’ as I observed to be your own method , instead of ‘ to instruct , ’ supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Very probably . But historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read ; and even you yourself , who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe , very intense application , may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth - while to be tormented for two or three years of one ’s life , for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it . Consider — if reading had not been taught , Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain — or perhaps might not have written at all . ”
Henry Tilney	“ That I do not know , nor who is the author . I have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet . ”
Henry Tilney	“ A particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from London yesterday . It is to be uncommonly dreadful . I shall expect murder and everything of the kind . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Government , ”
Henry Tilney	“ neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters . There must be murder ; and government cares not how much . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Come , shall I make you understand each other , or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can ? No — I will be noble . I will prove myself a man , no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head . I have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours . Perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute — neither vigorous nor keen . Perhaps they may want observation , discernment , judgment , fire , genius , and wit . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Riot ! what riot ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ How very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people ’s actions . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Why ? What do you mean ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ With you , it is not , How is such a one likely to be influenced , What is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person ’s feelings , age , situation , and probable habits of life considered — but , How should _ I _ be influenced , What would be _ my _ inducement in acting so and so ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ I do not understand you . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Then we are on very unequal terms , for I understand you perfectly well . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Me ? Yes ; I can not speak well enough to be unintelligible . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Bravo ! an excellent satire on modern language . ”
Henry Tilney	“ But pray tell me what you mean . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Shall I indeed ? Do you really desire it ? But you are not aware of the consequences ; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment , and certainly bring on a disagreement between us . ”
Henry Tilney	“ No , no ; it shall not do either ; I am not afraid . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother ’s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . ”
Henry Tilney	“ My brother does know it , ”
Henry Tilney	“ Does he ? Then why does he stay here ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ I am sure my brother would not wish to do that . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Then you will persuade him to go away ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ Persuasion is not at command ; but pardon me , if I can not even endeavour to persuade him . I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged . He knows what he is about , and must be his own master . ”
Henry Tilney	“ And are you sure it is my brother ’s doing ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ Is it my brother ’s attentions to Miss Thorpe , or Miss Thorpe ’s admission of them , that gives the pain ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference . No man is offended by another man ’s admiration of the woman he loves ; it is the woman only who can make it a torment . ”
Henry Tilney	“ My dear Miss Morland , ”
Henry Tilney	“ in this amiable solicitude for your brother ’s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ? Are you not carried a little too far ? Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe ’s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ? Is he safe only in solitude ? Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else ? He can not think this — and you may be sure that he would not have you think it . I will not say , ‘ Do not be uneasy , ’ because I know that you are so , at this moment ; but be as little uneasy as you can . You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend ; depend upon it , therefore , that real jealousy never can exist between them ; depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration . Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Northanger is not more than half my home ; I have an establishment at my own house in Woodston , which is nearly twenty miles from my father ’s , and some of my time is necessarily spent there . ”
Henry Tilney	“ I am always sorry to leave Eleanor . ”
Henry Tilney	“ To be sure , I have . Is not it a fine old place , just like what one reads about ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ Oh ! yes — I do not think I should be easily frightened , because there would be so many people in the house — and besides , it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years , and then the family come back to it unawares , without giving any notice , as generally happens . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Oh ! but this will not happen to me , I am sure . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Oh ! mr . Tilney , how frightful ! this is just like a book ! but it can not really happen to me . I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy . Well , what then ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ No , indeed ; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Oh , no , no ; do not say so . Well , go on . ”
Henry Tilney	“ How came I up that staircase ! ”
Henry Tilney	“ Because it is my nearest way from the stable - yard to my own chamber ; and why should I not come up it ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ And may I not , in my turn , ”
Henry Tilney	“ ask how _ you _ came here ? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast - parlour to your apartment , as that staircase can be from the stables to mine . ”
Henry Tilney	“ My mother ’s room ! is there anything extraordinary to be seen there ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ I did not expect to be able to return sooner , when I went away ; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me . You look pale . I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs . Perhaps you did not know — you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ Very ; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ And that prevented you , ”
Henry Tilney	“ Have you looked into all the rooms in that passage ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ It is only a quarter past four , ”
Henry Tilney	“ and you are not now in Bath . No theatre , no rooms to prepare for . Half an hour at Northanger must be enough . ”
Henry Tilney	“ I am sorry , ”
Henry Tilney	“ if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome , I should have given it with very different feelings . ”
Henry Tilney	“ To have so kind - hearted , so affectionate a sister , ”
Henry Tilney	“ must be a comfort to him under any distress . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Our brother ! frederick ! ”
Henry Tilney	“ Indeed I am afraid she will , ”
Henry Tilney	“ I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick ’s only chance . I will get the Bath paper , and look over the arrivals . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Among all the great variety that you have known and studied . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present ; but we must not , in our concern for his sufferings , undervalue yours . You feel , I suppose , that in losing Isabella , you lose half yourself : you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy . Society is becoming irksome ; and as for the amusements in which you were wo nt to share at Bath , the very idea of them without her is abhorrent . You would not , for instance , now go to a ball for the world . You feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve , on whose regard you can place dependence , or whose counsel , in any difficulty , you could rely on . You feel all this ? ”
Henry Tilney	“ You feel , as you always do , what is most to the credit of human nature . Such feelings ought to be investigated , that they may know themselves . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Well , well , we will take our chance some one of those days . There is no need to fix . You are not to put yourself at all out of your way . Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough . I think I can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor ’s table . Let me see ; Monday will be a busy day with you , we will not come on Monday ; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me . I expect my surveyor from Brockham with his report in the morning ; and afterwards I can not in decency fail attending the club . I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now ; for , as I am known to be in the country , it would be taken exceedingly amiss ; and it is a rule with me , Miss Morland , never to give offence to any of my neighbours , if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it . They are a set of very worthy men . They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year ; and I dine with them whenever I can . Tuesday , therefore , we may say is out of the question . But on Wednesday , I think , Henry , you may expect us ; and we shall be with you early , that we may have time to look about us . Two hours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston , I suppose ; we shall be in the carriage by ten ; so , about a quarter before one on Wednesday , you may look for us . ”
Henry Tilney	“ I am come , young ladies , in a very moralizing strain , to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for , and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage , giving ready - monied actual happiness for a draft on the future , that may not be honoured . Witness myself , at this present hour . Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on Wednesday , which bad weather , or twenty other causes , may prevent , I must go away directly , two days before I intended it . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Why ! how can you ask the question ? Because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits , because I must go and prepare a dinner for you , to be sure . ”
Henry Tilney	“ Aye , and sadly too — for I had much rather stay . ”
Henry Tilney	“ I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister ’s account and mine . You must know it to be so ; and the General made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary : besides , if he had not said half so much as he did , he has always such an excellent dinner at home , that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify . ”
Henry Tilney	“ I wish I could reason like you , for his sake and my own . Good - bye . As to - morrow is Sunday , Eleanor , I shall not return . ”
Henry Tilney	“ It will soon be as if you never had , ”
General Tilney	“ Oh , no ; Catherine was sure they would not have the least objection , and she should have great pleasure in coming . ”
General Tilney	“ the day was fine , and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible . ”
General Tilney	“ that she must have been used to much better - sized apartments at Mr. Allen ’s ? ”
General Tilney	“ This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother ’s fortitude , ”
General Tilney	“ Woodston will make but a sombre appearance to - day . ”
General Tilney	“ What say you , Eleanor ? Speak your opinion , for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men . I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations . The house stands among fine meadows facing the south - east , with an excellent kitchen - garden in the same aspect ; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago , for the benefit of my son . It is a family living , Miss Morland ; and the property in the place being chiefly my own , you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one . Did Henry ’s income depend solely on this living , he would not be ill - provided for . Perhaps it may seem odd , that with only two younger children , I should think any profession necessary for him ; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business . But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies , I am sure your father , Miss Morland , would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment . The money is nothing , it is not an object , but employment is the thing . Even Frederick , my eldest son , you see , who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county , has his profession . ”
General Tilney	“ without any ambition of that sort himself — without any solicitude about it — he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom . If he had a hobby - horse , it was _ that _ . He loved a garden . Though careless enough in most matters of eating , he loved good fruit — or if he did not , his friends and children did . There were great vexations , however , attending such a garden as his . The utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits . The pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year . Mr. Allen , he supposed , must feel these inconveniences as well as himself . ”
General Tilney	“ No , not at all . Mr. Allen did not care about the garden , and never went into it . ”
General Tilney	“ How were Mr. Allen ’s succession - houses worked ? ”
General Tilney	“ Mr. Allen had only one small hot - house , which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter , and there was a fire in it now and then . ”
General Tilney	“ He is a happy man ! ”
General Tilney	“ The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him , and he would meet them by another course . ”
General Tilney	“ Her picture , I suppose , ”
General Tilney	“ hangs in your father ’s room ? ”
General Tilney	“ No ; it was intended for the drawing - room ; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting , and for some time it had no place . Soon after her death I obtained it for my own , and hung it in my bed - chamber — where I shall be happy to show it you ; it is very like . ”
General Tilney	“ This lengthened absence , these solitary rambles , did not speak a mind at ease , or a conscience void of reproach . ”
General Tilney	“ Eleanor ”
General Tilney	“ No , ”
General Tilney	“ my father ’s hands need not be strengthened , and Frederick ’s confession of folly need not be forestalled . He must tell his own story . ”
General Tilney	“ A quarter would be enough . ”
General Tilney	“ We are not calling it a good house , ”
General Tilney	“ We are not comparing it with Fullerton and Northanger — we are considering it as a mere parsonage , small and confined , we allow , but decent , perhaps , and habitable ; and altogether not inferior to the generality ; or , in other words , I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so good . It may admit of improvement , however . Far be it from me to say otherwise ; and anything in reason — a bow thrown out , perhaps — though , between ourselves , if there is one thing more than another my aversion , it is a patched - on bow . ”
General Tilney	“ I trust , ”
General Tilney	“ that it will very speedily be furnished : it waits only for a lady ’s taste ! ”
General Tilney	“ You like it — you approve it as an object — it is enough . Henry , remember that Robinson is spoken to about it . The cottage remains . ”
General Tilney	“ Your Ladyship ! ”
General Tilney	“ He is a fine old fellow , upon my soul ! stout , active — looks as young as his son . I have a great regard for him , I assure you : a gentleman - like , good sort of fellow as ever lived . ”
General Tilney	“ Know him ! there are few people much about town that I do not know . I have met him forever at the Bedford ; and I knew his face again to - day the moment he came into the billiard - room . One of the best players we have , by the by ; and we had a little touch together , though I was almost afraid of him at first : the odds were five to four against me ; and , if I had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world — I took his ball exactly — but I could not make you understand it without a table ; however , I _ did _ beat him . A very fine fellow ; as rich as a Jew . I should like to dine with him ; I dare say he gives famous dinners . But what do you think we have been talking of ? You . Yes , by heavens ! and the General thinks you the finest girl in Bath . ”
General Tilney	“ And what do you think I said?”—lowering
General Tilney	“ Since they can consent to part with you , ”
General Tilney	“ we may expect philosophy from all the world . ”
General Tilney	“ Dinner to be on table _ directly ! _ ”
General Tilney	“ I have many pamphlets to finish , ”
General Tilney	“ before I can close my eyes , and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep . Can either of us be more meetly employed ? _ My _ eyes will be blinding for the good of others , and _ yours _ preparing by rest for future mischief . ”
John Thorpe	“ You will find , however , Miss Morland , it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people , for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day ; Jackson , of Oriel , bid me sixty at once ; Morland was with me at the time . ”
John Thorpe	“ My horse ! oh , d — — it ! i would not sell my horse for a hundred . Are you fond of an open carriage , Miss Morland ? ”
John Thorpe	“ I am glad of it ; I will drive you out in mine every day . ”
John Thorpe	“ I will drive you up Lansdown Hill to - morrow . ”
John Thorpe	“ Thank you ; but will not your horse want rest ? ”
John Thorpe	“ Rest ! he has only come three and twenty miles to - day ; all nonsense ; nothing ruins horses so much as rest ; nothing knocks them up so soon . No , no ; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while I am here . ”
John Thorpe	“ Forty ! aye , fifty , for what I care . Well , I will drive you up Lansdown to - morrow ; mind , I am engaged . ”
John Thorpe	“ A third indeed ! no , no ; I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about ; that would be a good joke , faith ! morland must take care of you . ”
John Thorpe	“ Well , Miss Morland , I suppose you and I are to stand up and jig it together again . ”
John Thorpe	“ Oh , no ; I am much obliged to you , our two dances are over ; and , besides , I am tired , and do not mean to dance any more . ”
John Thorpe	“ Well , Miss Morland , here I am . Have you been waiting long ? We could not come before ; the old devil of a coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into , and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out of the street . How do you do , Mrs. Allen ? A famous ball last night , was not it ? Come , Miss Morland , be quick , for the others are in a confounded hurry to be off . They want to get their tumble over . ”
John Thorpe	“ Going to ? Why , you have not forgot our engagement ! did not we agree together to take a drive this morning ? What a head you have ! we are going up Claverton Down . ”
John Thorpe	“ Heyday , Miss Morland ! ”
John Thorpe	“ What is the meaning of this ? I thought you and I were to dance together . ”
John Thorpe	“ I wonder you should think so , for you never asked me . ”
John Thorpe	“ That is a good one , by Jove ! i asked you as soon as I came into the room , and I was just going to ask you again , but when I turned round , you were gone ! this is a cursed shabby trick ! i only came for the sake of dancing with _ you _ , and I firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since Monday . Yes ; I remember , I asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak . And here have I been telling all my acquaintance that I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room ; and when they see you standing up with somebody else , they will quiz me famously . ”
John Thorpe	“ Oh , no ; they will never think of _ me _ , after such a description as that . ”
John Thorpe	“ Make haste ! make haste ! ”
John Thorpe	“ Put on your hat this moment — there is no time to be lost — we are going to Bristol . How d’ye do , Mrs. Allen ? ”
John Thorpe	“ To Bristol ! is not that a great way off ? But , however , I can not go with you to - day , because I am engaged ; I expect some friends every moment . ”
John Thorpe	“ Well , Miss Morland , ”
John Thorpe	“ I am come to bid you good - bye . ”
John Thorpe	“ A famous good thing this marrying scheme , upon my soul ! a clever fancy of Morland ’s and Belle ’s . What do you think of it , Miss Morland ? _ I _ say it is no bad notion . ”
John Thorpe	“ I am sure I think it a very good one . ”
John Thorpe	“ Do you ? That ’s honest , by heavens ! i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony , however . Did you ever hear the old song , ‘ Going to One Wedding Brings on Another ? ’ I say , you will come to Belle ’s wedding , I hope . ”
John Thorpe	“ Yes ; I have promised your sister to be with her , if possible . ”
John Thorpe	“ And then you know”—twisting
John Thorpe	laugh—“I say , then you know , we may try the truth of this same old song . ”
John Thorpe	“ May we ? But I never sing . Well , I wish you a good journey . I dine with Miss Tilney to - day , and must now be going home . ”
John Thorpe	“ Nay , but there is no such confounded hurry . Who knows when we may be together again ? Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a fortnight , and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me . ”
John Thorpe	“ That is kind of you , however — kind and good - natured . I shall not forget it in a hurry . But you have more good nature and all that , than anybody living , I believe . A monstrous deal of good nature , and it is not only good nature , but you have so much , so much of everything ; and then you have such — upon my soul , I do not know anybody like you . ”
John Thorpe	“ Oh ! dear , there are a great many people like me , I dare say , only a great deal better . Good morning to you . ”
John Thorpe	“ But I say , Miss Morland , I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton before it is long , if not disagreeable . ”
John Thorpe	“ Pray do . My father and mother will be very glad to see you . ”
John Thorpe	“ And I hope — I hope , Miss Morland , _ you _ will not be sorry to see me . ”
John Thorpe	“ Oh ! dear , not at all . There are very few people I am sorry to see . Company is always cheerful . ”
John Thorpe	“ That is just my way of thinking . Give me but a little cheerful company , let me only have the company of the people I love , let me only be where I like and with whom I like , and the devil take the rest , say I. And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same . But I have a notion , Miss Morland , you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters . ”
John Thorpe	“ Perhaps we may ; but it is more than I ever thought of . And as to _ most matters _ , to say the truth , there are not many that I know my own mind about . ”
John Thorpe	“ By Jove , no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me . My notion of things is simple enough . Let me only have the girl I like , say I , with a comfortable house over my head , and what care I for all the rest ? Fortune is nothing . I am sure of a good income of my own ; and if she had not a penny , why , so much the better . ”
John Thorpe	“ Very true . I think like you there . If there is a good fortune on one side , there can be no occasion for any on the other . No matter which has it , so that there is enough . I hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another . And to marry for money I think the wickedest thing in existence . Good day . We shall be very glad to see you at Fullerton , whenever it is convenient . ”
John Thorpe	“ Well , ma’am , what do you say to it ? Can you spare me for an hour or two ? Shall I go ? ”
John Thorpe	“ You will not be frightened , Miss Morland , ”
John Thorpe	“ if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off . He will , most likely , give a plunge or two , and perhaps take the rest for a minute ; but he will soon know his master . He is full of spirits , playful as can be , but there is no vice in him . ”
John Thorpe	“ You croaking fellow ! ”
John Thorpe	“ We shall be able to do ten times more . Kingsweston ! aye , and Blaize Castle too , and anything else we can hear of ; but here is your sister says she will not go . ”
John Thorpe	“ The finest place in England — worth going fifty miles at any time to see . ”
John Thorpe	“ The oldest in the kingdom . ”
John Thorpe	“ Exactly — the very same . ”
John Thorpe	“ By dozens . ”
John Thorpe	“ Not go ! my beloved creature , what do you mean ? ”
John Thorpe	smile—“I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk . They promised to come at twelve , only it rained ; but now , as it is so fine , I dare say they will be here soon . ”
John Thorpe	“ Not they indeed , ”
John Thorpe	“ for , as we turned into Broad Street , I saw them — does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts ? ”
John Thorpe	“ I do not know indeed . ”
John Thorpe	“ Yes , I know he does ; I saw him . You are talking of the man you danced with last night , are not you ? ”
John Thorpe	“ Yes . ”
John Thorpe	“ Well , I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road , driving a smart - looking girl . ”
John Thorpe	“ Did you indeed ? ”
John Thorpe	“ Did upon my soul ; knew him again directly , and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too . ”
John Thorpe	“ It is very odd ! but I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk . ”
John Thorpe	“ And well they might , for I never saw so much dirt in my life . Walk ! You could no more walk than you could fly ! it has not been so dirty the whole winter ; it is ankle - deep everywhere . ”
John Thorpe	“ I should like to see the castle ; but may we go all over it ? May we go up every staircase , and into every suite of rooms ? ”
John Thorpe	“ But then , if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer , and call by and by ? ”
John Thorpe	“ Then I will . Shall I go , Mrs. Allen ? ”
John Thorpe	“ Mrs. Allen , you must persuade her to go , ”
John Thorpe	“ How could you deceive me so , Mr. Thorpe ? How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown Road ? I would not have had it happen so for the world . They must think it so strange , so rude of me ! to go by them , too , without saying a word ! you do not know how vexed I am ; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton , nor in anything else . I had rather , ten thousand times rather , get out now , and walk back to them . How could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton ? ”
John Thorpe	“ It is all one to me , ”
John Thorpe	“ If your brother had not got such a d — — beast to drive , ”
John Thorpe	“ we might have done it very well . My horse would have trotted to Clifton within the hour , if left to himself , and I have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken - winded jade ’s pace . Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own . ”
John Thorpe	“ And why can not he afford it ? ”
John Thorpe	“ And whose fault is that ? ”
John Thorpe	“ Nobody ’s , that I know of . ”
John Thorpe	“ Thank ye , ”
John Thorpe	“ but I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about , and look like a fool . No , if you do not go , d — — me if I do . I only go for the sake of driving you . ”
John Thorpe	“ She is as obstinate as — ”
James Morland	“ Well , Catherine , how do you like my friend Thorpe ? ”
James Morland	“ Indeed , Catherine , I love you dearly . ”
James Morland	“ My dear Isabella , how was it possible for me to get at you ? I could not even see where you were . ”
James Morland	“ Upon my honour , ”
James Morland	“ in these public assemblies , it is as often done as not . ”
James Morland	“ No , not at all ; but if you think it wrong , you had much better change . ”
James Morland	“ What a sweet girl she is ! i quite dote on her . ”
James Morland	“ Catherine , you must go , ”
James Morland	“ I did not think you had been so obstinate , Catherine , ”
James Morland	“ you were not used to be so hard to persuade ; you once were the kindest , best - tempered of my sisters . ”
James Morland	“ Indeed , Morland , I must drive you away . Consider how far you have to ride . I can not bear to see you linger so . For heaven ’s sake , waste no more time . There , go , go — I insist on it . ”
James Morland	“ perhaps , ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ I used to walk here so often with her ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ though I never loved it then , as I have loved it since . At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice . But her memory endears it now . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ No bad news from Fullerton , I hope ? Mr. and Mrs. Morland — your brothers and sisters — I hope they are none of them ill ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ But , ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ would it be to promote his happiness , to enable him to marry such a girl ? She must be an unprincipled one , or she could not have used your brother so . And how strange an infatuation on Frederick ’s side ! a girl who , before his eyes , is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man ! is not it inconceivable , Henry ? Frederick too , who always wore his heart so proudly ! who found no woman good enough to be loved ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Such a sister - in - law , Henry , I should delight in , ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Good heaven ! what can be the matter ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ You are mistaken , indeed , ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ it is no one from Woodston . It is my father himself . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ You are too good , I am sure , to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform . I am indeed a most unwilling messenger . After what has so lately passed , so lately been settled between us — how joyfully , how thankfully on my side!—as to your continuing here as I hoped for many , many weeks longer , how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted — and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by — But I must not trust myself with words . My dear Catherine , we are to part . My father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on Monday . We are going to Lord Longtown ’s , near Hereford , for a fortnight . Explanation and apology are equally impossible . I can not attempt either . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ It will not be in my power , Catherine . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Ah , Catherine ! were it settled so , it would be somewhat less intolerable , though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought . But — how can I tell you?—to - morrow morning is fixed for your leaving us , and not even the hour is left to your choice ; the very carriage is ordered , and will be here at seven o’clock , and no servant will be offered you . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Alas ! for my feelings as a daughter , all that I know , all that I answer for , is that you can have given him no just cause of offence . He certainly is greatly , very greatly discomposed ; I have seldom seen him more so . His temper is not happy , and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree ; some disappointment , some vexation , which just at this moment seems important , but which I can hardly suppose you to have any concern in , for how is it possible ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ I hope , I earnestly hope , that to your real safety it will be of none ; but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence : to comfort , appearance , propriety , to your family , to the world . Were your friends , the Allens , still in Bath , you might go to them with comparative ease ; a few hours would take you there ; but a journey of seventy miles , to be taken post by you , at your age , alone , unattended ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Oh , the journey is nothing . Do not think about that . And if we are to part , a few hours sooner or later , you know , makes no difference . I can be ready by seven . Let me be called in time . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ No , Eleanor , if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me , I am sure I had better not write . There can be no doubt of my getting home safe . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ I can not wonder at your feelings . I will not importune you . I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ to be a fool if he liked it ! ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ He must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the other evening , when he saw me sitting down . But I really had been engaged the whole day to Mr. Thorpe . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before , he was in Bath but for a couple of days . He came only to engage lodgings for us . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Yes , an acquaintance of Mrs. Hughes . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Not very . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Yes , sometimes ; but he has rid out this morning with my father . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Perhaps we — Yes , I think we certainly shall . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ I do not care . Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message . If I had thought it right to put it off , I could have spoken to Miss Tilney myself . This is only doing it in a ruder way ; and how do I know that Mr. Thorpe has — He may be mistaken again perhaps ; he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday . Let me go , Mr. Thorpe ; Isabella , do not hold me . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Yes , ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ and I remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me , and that when I was called away for only five minutes to answer a note , instead of waiting for me , you took the volume into the Hermitage Walk , and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ I am very glad to hear it indeed , and now I shall never be ashamed of liking Udolpho myself . But I really thought before , young men despised novels amazingly . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Not very good , I am afraid . But now really , do not you think Udolpho the nicest book in the world ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Henry , ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ you are very impertinent . Miss Morland , he is treating you exactly as he does his sister . He is forever finding fault with me , for some incorrectness of language , and now he is taking the same liberty with you . The word ‘ nicest , ’ as you used it , did not suit him ; and you had better change it as soon as you can , or we shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Historians , you think , ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ are not happy in their flights of fancy . They display imagination without raising interest . I am fond of history — and am very well contented to take the false with the true . In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records , which may be as much depended on , I conclude , as anything that does not actually pass under one ’s own observation ; and as for the little embellishments you speak of , they are embellishments , and I like them as such . If a speech be well drawn up , I read it with pleasure , by whomsoever it may be made — and probably with much greater , if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson , than if the genuine words of Caractacus , Agricola , or Alfred the Great . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Indeed ! and of what nature ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Good heaven ! where could you hear of such a thing ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ You speak with astonishing composure ! but I hope your friend ’s accounts have been exaggerated ; and if such a design is known beforehand , proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Miss Morland , do not mind what he says ; but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ My dear Eleanor , the riot is only in your own brain . The confusion there is scandalous . Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out , in three duodecimo volumes , two hundred and seventy - six pages in each , with a frontispiece to the first , of two tombstones and a lantern — do you understand ? And you , Miss Morland — my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions . You talked of expected horrors in London — and instead of instantly conceiving , as any rational creature would have done , that such words could relate only to a circulating library , she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George ’s Fields , the Bank attacked , the Tower threatened , the streets of London flowing with blood , a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons ( the hopes of the nation ) called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents , and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney , in the moment of charging at the head of his troop , knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window . Forgive her stupidity . The fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman ; but she is by no means a simpleton in general . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ And now , Henry , ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ that you have made us understand each other , you may as well make Miss Morland understand yourself — unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister , and a great brute in your opinion of women in general . Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ No doubt ; but that is no explanation of the present . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ What am I to do ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ You know what you ought to do . Clear your character handsomely before her . Tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Miss Morland , I think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world — especially of those — whoever they may be — with whom I happen to be in company . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ That is not enough . Be more serious . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Miss Morland , no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than I do . In my opinion , nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ We shall get nothing more serious from him now , Miss Morland . He is not in a sober mood . But I do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood , if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all , or an unkind one of me . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ Perhaps , ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ you would be so good — it would make me very happy if — ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ That is a curious old chest , is not it ? ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ It is impossible to say how many generations it has been here . How it came to be first put in this room I know not , but I have not had it moved , because I thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets . The worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open . In that corner , however , it is at least out of the way . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine ; and do not be uneasy on my father ’s account ; he always walks out at this time of day . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ This is so favourite a walk of mine , ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ that I always think it the best and nearest way . But perhaps it may be damp . ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ No , ”
Eleanor Tilney	“ I was unfortunately from home . Her illness was sudden and short ; and , before I arrived it was all over . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ Here come my dear girls , ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ My dear Mrs. Allen , I long to introduce them ; they will be so delighted to see you : the tallest is Isabella , my eldest ; is not she a fine young woman ? The others are very much admired too , but I believe Isabella is the handsomest . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe ! ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ I do not like him at all , ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ I like him very much ; he seems very agreeable . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ He is as good - natured a fellow as ever lived ; a little of a rattle ; but that will recommend him to your sex , I believe : and how do you like the rest of the family ? ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ Very , very much indeed : Isabella particularly . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ I am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you . She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be ; and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you , Catherine , ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ may be proud of . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ Because I thought I should soon see you myself . I hope you will be a great deal together while you are in Bath . She is a most amiable girl ; such a superior understanding ! how fond all the family are of her ; she is evidently the general favourite ; and how much she must be admired in such a place as this — is not she ? ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ I dare say he does ; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen . I need not ask you whether you are happy here , my dear Catherine ; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe , it would be impossible for you to be otherwise ; and the Allens , I am sure , are very kind to you ? ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ And I hope , madam , that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place , from finding it of service to him . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ That circumstance must give great encouragement . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ Well , my dear , ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ I hope you have had an agreeable partner . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ I am glad of it . John has charming spirits , has not he ? ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ No , where is he ? ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ He was with us just now , and said he was so tired of lounging about , that he was resolved to go and dance ; so I thought perhaps he would ask you , if he met with you . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ Indeed he is , Mrs. Allen , ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ I must say it , though I _ am _ his mother , that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ I know what ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ dear John ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ dear Catherine ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ dear Anne and dear Maria ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ Mr. Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed , ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ I only wish I could do as much . One could not expect more from him , you know . If he finds he _ can _ do more by and by , I dare say he will , for I am sure he must be an excellent good - hearted man . Four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed , but your wishes , my dear Isabella , are so moderate , you do not consider how little you ever want , my dear . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ It is not on my own account I wish for more ; but I can not bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland , making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life . For myself , it is nothing ; I never think of myself . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ I know you never do , my dear ; and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you . There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you ; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you , my dear child — but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things . Mr. Morland has behaved so very handsome , you know . I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do , I am sure . But everybody has their failing , you know , and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money . ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ Yes , yes , my darling Isabella , ”
Mrs. Thorpe	“ we perfectly see into your heart . You have no disguise . We perfectly understand the present vexation ; and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection . ”
Frederick Tilney	“ What ! always to be watched , in person or by proxy ! ”
Frederick Tilney	“ I wish your heart were independent . That would be enough for me . ”
Frederick Tilney	“ If we have not hearts , we have eyes ; and they give us torment enough . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Yes , my dear , ”
Mrs. Allen	“ it is very uncomfortable indeed . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Aye , so we do . That is very disagreeable . I wish we had a large acquaintance here . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Very true , my dear ; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly . The Skinners were here last year — I wish they were here now . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ No more there are , indeed . How very provoking ! but I think we had better sit still , for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd ! how is my head , my dear ? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it , I am afraid . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ I do n’t , upon my word — I wish I did . I wish I had a large acquaintance here with all my heart , and then I should get you a partner . I should be so glad to have you dance . There goes a strange - looking woman ! what an odd gown she has got on ! how old - fashioned it is ! look at the back . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ I am quite of your opinion , sir , ”
Mrs. Allen	“ and so I told Miss Morland when she bought it . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ What a delightful place Bath is , ”
Mrs. Allen	“ and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Well , sir , and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again , for it is just the place for young people — and indeed for everybody else too . I tell Mr. Allen , when he talks of being sick of it , that I am sure he should not complain , for it is so very agreeable a place , that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year . I tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Thank you , sir . I have no doubt that he will . A neighbour of ours , Dr. Skinner , was here for his health last winter , and came away quite stout . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Yes , sir — and Dr. Skinner and his family were here three months ; so I tell Mr. Allen he must not be in a hurry to get away . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Did you meet Mr. Tilney , my dear ? ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Ah ! he has got a partner ; I wish he had asked _ you _ , ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Do just as you please , my dear , ”
Mrs. Allen	“ She had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day , if the clouds would only go off , and the sun keep out . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ I thought how it would be , ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Perhaps it may , but then , my dear , it will be so dirty . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ No , ”
Mrs. Allen	“ I know you never mind dirt . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ Isabella , my brother , and Mr. Thorpe , I declare ! they are coming for me perhaps — but I shall not go — I can not go indeed , for you know Miss Tilney may still call . ”
Mrs. Allen	“ My dear , you tumble my gown , ”
Mrs. Allen	remark—“I really have not patience with the General”—to
Mrs. Morland	“ I beg , Catherine , you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat , when you come from the Rooms at night ; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend ; I will give you this little book on purpose . ”
Mrs. Morland	“ I am sorry for the young people , ”
Mrs. Morland	“ This has been a strange acquaintance , ”
Mrs. Morland	“ soon made and soon ended . I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella . Ah ! poor James ! well , we must live and learn ; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping . ”
Mrs. Morland	“ If so , my dear , I dare say you will meet again some time or other ; do not be uneasy . It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years ; and then what a pleasure it will be ! ”
Mrs. Morland	“ We are sorry for him , ”
Mrs. Morland	“ but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off ; for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with , and who was so entirely without fortune ; and now , after such behaviour , we can not think at all well of her . Just at present it comes hard to poor James ; but that will not last forever ; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life , for the foolishness of his first choice . ”
Mrs. Morland	“ Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening , ”
Mrs. Morland	“ She travelled all the way post by herself , and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night ; for General Tilney , from some odd fancy or other , all of a sudden grew tired of having her there , and almost turned her out of the house . Very unfriendly , certainly ; and he must be a very odd man ; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again ! and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . ”
Mr. Allen	“ Well , Miss Morland , ”
Mr. Allen	“ I hope you have had an agreeable ball . ”
Mr. Allen	“ We shall do better another evening I hope , ”
Mr. Allen	“ I am glad your brother had so much sense ; I am glad you are come back . It was a strange , wild scheme . ”
Mr. Allen	“ Well , ”
Mr. Allen	“ and do you think of going too ? ”
Mr. Allen	“ No , certainly not ; and I am glad you do not think of it . These schemes are not at all the thing . Young men and women driving about the country in open carriages ! now and then it is very well ; but going to inns and public places together ! it is not right ; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should allow it . I am glad you do not think of going ; I am sure Mrs. Morland would not be pleased . Mrs. Allen , are not you of my way of thinking ? Do not you think these kind of projects objectionable ? ”
Mr. Allen	“ I know you do ; but that is not the question . Do not you think it has an odd appearance , if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men , to whom they are not even related ? ”
Mr. Allen	“ As far as it has gone hitherto , there is no harm done , ”
Mr. Allen	“ and I would only advise you , my dear , not to go out with Mr. Thorpe any more . ”
Mr. Allen	“ You had better leave her alone , my dear ; she is old enough to know what she is about , and if not , has a mother to advise her . Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt ; but , however , you had better not interfere . She and your brother choose to go , and you will be only getting ill will . ”
