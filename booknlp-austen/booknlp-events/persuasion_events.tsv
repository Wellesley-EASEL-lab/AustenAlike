Anne Elliot	agent	disliked	All Anne 's wishes had been for the latter . A small house in their own neighbourhood , where they might still have Lady Russell 's society , still be near Mary , and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch , was the object of her ambition . But the usual fate of Anne attended her , in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on . She disliked Bath , and did not think it agreed with her ; and Bath was to be her home .

Anne Elliot	agent	found	It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood . Anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw , and to Sir Walter 's feelings they must have been dreadful .

Anne Elliot	agent	happening	And with regard to Anne 's dislike of Bath , she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising , first , from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there , after her mother 's death ; and secondly , from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself . Lady Russell was fond of Bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend 's health , by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good .

Anne Elliot	agent	included	She had never received from her more than outward attention , nothing beyond the observances of complaisance ; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry , against previous inclination . She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : Elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility . 
Anne Elliot	agent	spoke--	"I venture to hint , that Sir Walter Elliot can not be half so jealous for his own , as John Shepherd will be for him .

Anne Elliot	agent	observed	First , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man 's youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man . I have observed it all my life . 
Anne Elliot	agent	talking	A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line . One day last spring , in town , I was in company with two men , striking instances of what I am talking of ; Lord St Ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; I was to give place to Lord St Ives , and a certain Admiral Baldwin , the most deplorable - looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top . ` In the name of heaven , who is that old fellow ? ' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( Sir Basil Morley ) . ` Old fellow ! ' cried Sir Basil , ` it is Admiral Baldwin . What do you take his age to be ? '

Anne Elliot	agent	had	Half the sum of attraction , on either side , might have been enough , for he had nothing to do , and she had hardly anybody to love ; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail .

Anne Elliot	agent	acted	She was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing : indiscreet , improper , hardly capable of success , and not deserving it . But it was not a merely selfish caution , under which she acted , in putting an end to it .

This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory , and decided the whole business at once .

Anne Elliot	agent	walking	"Again , it was Mary 's complaint , that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the Great House with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place . And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves , one of them after talking of rank , people of rank , and jealousy of rank , said , "" I have no scruple of observing to you , how nonsensical some persons are about their place , because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it ; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious , especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma . Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma , but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it . "

In all other respects , her visit began and proceeded very well . 
Anne Elliot	agent	believed	Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject , by being removed three miles from Kellynch ; Mary 's ailments lessened by having a constant companion , and their daily intercourse with the other family , since there was neither superior affection , confidence , nor employment in the cottage , to be interrupted by it , was rather an advantage . It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible , for they met every morning , and hardly ever spent an evening asunder ; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's respectable forms in the usual places , or without the talking , laughing , and singing of their daughters . 
Anne Elliot	agent	played	She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves , but having no voice , no knowledge of the harp , and no fond parents , to sit by and fancy themselves delighted , her performance was little thought of , only out of civility , or to refresh the others , as she was well aware . She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself ; but this was no new sensation .

Mrs Croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person . She had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather - beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight - and - thirty . Her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour .

If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ?

Anne Elliot	agent	had	"Mr and Mrs Musgrove , either from seeing little , or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters , and of all the young men who came near them , seemed to leave everything to take its chance . There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion - house ; but it was different at the Cottage : the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder ; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves ' company , and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared , when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister , as to which was the one liked best .

Anne Elliot	agent	deemed	As to Captain Wentworth 's views , she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister , or impeaching his own honour , than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa , or Louisa to Henrietta .

She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause .

Anne Elliot	agent	witness	As to the wretched party left behind , it could scarcely be said which of the three , who were completely rational , was suffering most : Captain Wentworth , Anne , or Charles , who , really a very affectionate brother , hung over Louisa with sobs of grief , and could only turn his eyes from one sister , to see the other in a state as insensible , or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife , calling on him

Anne Elliot	agent	lost	She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath . 
Anne Elliot	agent	thinking	Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father 's house in Camden Place , or her own sister 's intimacy with Mrs Clay . She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her .

Anne Elliot	agent	found	The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ) , had brought Anne the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more . He had enquired after her , she found , particularly ; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot 's not being the worse for her exertions , and had spoken of those exertions as great . This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done . As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove 's recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter !

Anne Elliot	agent	enquired	Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme . She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight .

Anne Elliot	agent	made	She made no reply . 
Anne Elliot	agent	left	She left it to himself to recollect , that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty , with little to live on , and no surname of dignity . 
Anne Elliot	agent	kept	Anne kept her appointment ; the others kept theirs , and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening . 
Anne Elliot	agent	heard	Anne kept her appointment ; the others kept theirs , and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening . 
Anne Elliot	agent	had	She had been the only one of the set absent , for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship 's service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot ; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early , and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her . Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell . 
Anne Elliot	agent	heard	"Anne heard her , and made no violent exclamations ; she only smiled , blushed , and gently shook her head . "" I am no match - maker , as you well know , "" said Lady Russell , "" being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations . "

Anne Elliot	agent	occupying	"Lady Russell let this pass , and only said in rejoinder , "" I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother 's place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me . You are your mother 's self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued ! My dearest Anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! "" "
Anne Elliot	agent	resist	"The idea of becoming what her mother had been ; of having the precious name of "" Lady Elliot "" first revived in herself ; of being restored to Kellynch , calling it her home again , her home for ever , was a charm which she could not immediately resist . Lady Russell said not another word , willing to leave the matter to its own operation ; and believing that , could Mr Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed , in short , what Anne did not believe .

Anne Elliot	agent	saw	She saw that there had been bad habits ; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing ; that there had been a period of his life ( and probably not a short one ) when he had been , at least , careless in all serious matters ; and , though he might now think very differently , who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever , cautious man , grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ? How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ? Mr Elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open . There was never any burst of feeling , any warmth of indignation or delight , at the evil or good of others . This , to Anne , was a decided imperfection .

Anne Elliot	agent	wanted	She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated . 
Anne Elliot	agent	heard	It was three weeks since she had heard at all . She only knew that Henrietta was at home again ; and that Louisa , though considered to be recovering fast , was still in Lyme ; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening , when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to her ; and , to quicken the pleasure and surprise , with Admiral and Mrs Croft 's compliments .

Anne Elliot	agent	visit	"Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond . "" How is Mary ? "" said Elizabeth ; and without waiting for an answer , "
Anne Elliot	agent	tried	This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth 's share of interest in the letter ; when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove , and her fine little boys , Anne was at liberty . In her own room , she tried to comprehend it . 
Anne Elliot	agent	thought	The conclusion of the whole was , that if the woman who had been sensible of Captain Wentworth 's merits could be allowed to prefer another man , there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder ; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it , certainly nothing to be regretted . No , it was not regret which made Anne 's heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free . 
Anne Elliot	agent	had	She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate . 
Anne Elliot	agent	longed	She longed to see the Crofts ; but when the meeting took place , it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them .

Anne Elliot	agent	engaged	Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the Admiral 's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her . Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft 's arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend 's carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral .

Anne Elliot	agent	found	She had never found it so difficult to listen to him , though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care , and though his subjects were principally such as were wo nt to be always interesting : praise , warm , just , and discriminating , of Lady Russell , and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay .

Anne Elliot	agent	distinguished	The following morning Anne was out with her friend , and for the first hour , in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain ; but at last , in returning down Pulteney Street , she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street .

Very , very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in . Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret , and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her , had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach ; and Anne -- but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne 's felicity , to draw any comparison between it and her sister 's ; the origin of one all selfish vanity , of the other all generous attachment .

Yes , some share of the tenderness of the past . She could not contemplate the change as implying less .

Anne Elliot	agent	said	""" This , "" said she , "" is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an Italian love - song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give ; for I do not pretend to understand the language . "

Anne Elliot	agent	think	Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford , Captain Wentworth 's brother .

Anne Elliot	agent	caught	He could not have come nearer to her if he would ; she was so surrounded and shut in : but she would rather have caught his eye .

Anne Elliot	agent	hoped	Now she hoped for some beneficial change ; and , after a period of nothing - saying amongst the party , some of them did decide on going in quest of tea . Anne was one of the few who did not choose to move . 
Anne Elliot	agent	remained	She remained in her seat , and so did Lady Russell ; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot ; and she did not mean , whatever she might feel on Lady Russell 's account , to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth , if he gave her the opportunity .

Anne Elliot	agent	quit	She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more , without the interchange of one friendly look . 
Anne Elliot	agent	do	She could not do so , without comparing herself with Miss Larolles , the inimitable Miss Larolles ; but still she did it , and not with much happier effect ; though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours , she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed .

Anne Elliot	agent	felt	He saw her too ; yet he looked grave , and seemed irresolute , and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her . She felt that something must be the matter . The change was indubitable . The difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room was strikingly great . 
Anne Elliot	agent	thought	She thought of her father , of Lady Russell . Could there have been any unpleasant glances ?

Anne Elliot	agent	believed	Could she have believed it a week ago ; three hours ago ! 
Anne Elliot	agent	recollected	Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith , meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call ; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object . 
Anne Elliot	agent	felt	She felt a great deal of good - will towards him . In spite of the mischief of his attentions , she owed him gratitude and regard , perhaps compassion . She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance , of the right which he seemed to have to interest her , by everything in situation , by his own sentiments , by his early prepossession .

Anne Elliot	agent	felt	How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case , was not worth enquiry ; for there was a Captain Wentworth ; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad , her affection would be his for ever . 
Anne Elliot	agent	believed	Their union , she believed , could not divide her more from other men , than their final separation . Prettier musings of high - wrought love and eternal constancy , could never have passed along the streets of Bath , than Anne was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings . It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way . 
Anne Elliot	agent	rejoice	An account of the concert was immediately claimed ; and Anne 's recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it .

Anne Elliot	agent	hoped	To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances , that a little trouble in the right place might do it , and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims , was hard to bear . It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne 's good offices with Mr Elliot . 
Anne Elliot	agent	preparing	She had previously , in the anticipation of their marriage , been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it ; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature , since he did not even know her to be in Bath , it immediately occurred , that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved , and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne 's feelings , as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot 's character would allow , when Anne 's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything ; and while it took from her the new - formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety , left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way . After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot , Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith 's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation .

Anne Elliot	agent	compounded	It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her ; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party , seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort . It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and Elizabeth ; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them !

Anne Elliot	agent	draw	They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove , and were at the White Hart . So much was pretty soon understood ; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing - room , and regaling themselves with her admiration , Anne could not draw upon Charles 's brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary , as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of . 
Anne Elliot	agent	found	She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove , Henrietta , and Captain Harville , beside their two selves .

Captain Harville , who had in truth been hearing none of it , now left his seat , and moved to a window , and Anne seeming to watch him , though it was from thorough absence of mind , became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood .

Anne Elliot	agent	felt	There she felt her own inferiority very keenly . 
Anne Elliot	agent	had	She had but two friends in the world to add to his list , Lady Russell and Mrs Smith . 
Anne Elliot	agent	had	Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for Mrs Smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently .

Anne Elliot	patient	attended	All Anne 's wishes had been for the latter . A small house in their own neighbourhood , where they might still have Lady Russell 's society , still be near Mary , and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch , was the object of her ambition . But the usual fate of Anne attended her , in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on . She disliked Bath , and did not think it agreed with her ; and Bath was to be her home .

Anne Elliot	patient	throw	He thought it a very degrading alliance ; and Lady Russell , though with more tempered and pardonable pride , received it as a most unfortunate one . Anne Elliot , with all her claims of birth , beauty , and mind , to throw herself away at nineteen ; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man , who had nothing but himself to recommend him , and no hopes of attaining affluence , but in the chances of a most uncertain profession , and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession , would be , indeed , a throwing away , which she grieved to think of !

Anne Elliot	patient	known	Anne Elliot , so young ; known to so few , to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune ; or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing , anxious , youth - killing dependence ! 
Anne Elliot	patient	advising	Such opposition , as these feelings produced , was more than Anne could combat . Young and gentle as she was , it might yet have been possible to withstand her father 's ill - will , though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister ; but Lady Russell , whom she had always loved and relied on , could not , with such steadiness of opinion , and such tenderness of manner , be continually advising her in vain . 
Anne Elliot	patient	persuaded	She was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing : indiscreet , improper , hardly capable of success , and not deserving it . But it was not a merely selfish caution , under which she acted , in putting an end to it . 
Anne Elliot	patient	solicited	No second attachment , the only thoroughly natural , happy , and sufficient cure , at her time of life , had been possible to the nice tone of her mind , the fastidiousness of her taste , in the small limits of the society around them . She had been solicited , when about two - and - twenty , to change her name , by the young man , who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister ; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal ; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man , whose landed property and general importance were second in that country , only to Sir Walter 's , and of good character and appearance ; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more , while Anne was nineteen , she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty - two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father 's house , and settled so permanently near herself . 
Anne Elliot	patient	tempted	But in this case , Anne had left nothing for advice to do ; and though Lady Russell , as satisfied as ever with her own discretion , never wished the past undone , she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne 's being tempted , by some man of talents and independence , to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits . They knew not each other 's opinion , either its constancy or its change , on the one leading point of Anne 's conduct , for the subject was never alluded to ; but Anne , at seven - and - twenty , thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen . She did not blame Lady Russell , she did not blame herself for having been guided by her ; but she felt that were any young person , in similar circumstances , to apply to her for counsel , they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness , such uncertain future good .

Anne Elliot	patient	persuaded	She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home , and every anxiety attending his profession , all their probable fears , delays , and disappointments , she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement , than she had been in the sacrifice of it ; and this , she fully believed , had the usual share , had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs , without reference to the actual results of their case , which , as it happened , would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on . 
Anne Elliot	patient	told	He had , very soon after their engagement ceased , got employ : and all that he had told her would follow , had taken place . 
Anne Elliot	patient	forced	how eloquent , at least , were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment , and a cheerful confidence in futurity , against that over - anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence ! She had been forced into prudence in her youth , she learned romance as she grew older : the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning . 
Anne Elliot	patient	told	She often told herself it was folly , before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no evil . She was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness , among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past , which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it .

Anne Elliot	patient	want	""" I can not possibly do without Anne , "" was Mary 's reasoning ; and Elizabeth 's reply was , "" Then I am sure Anne had better stay , for nobody will want her in Bath . "
Anne Elliot	patient	took	This invitation of Mary 's removed all Lady Russell 's difficulties , and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her , and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge . 
Anne Elliot	patient	become	Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts ; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell . 
Anne Elliot	patient	excuse	Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger , that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister . 
Anne Elliot	patient	draw	The last office of the four carriage - horses was to draw Sir Walter , Miss Elliot , and Mrs Clay to Bath . 
Anne Elliot	patient	give	It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds , and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into ; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village , and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived , she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne . 
Anne Elliot	patient	set	Accordingly their removal was made together , and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage , in the first stage of Lady Russell 's journey . Uppercross was a moderate - sized village , which a few years back had been completely in the old English style , containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers ; the mansion of the squire , with its high walls , great gates , and old trees , substantial and unmodernized , and the compact , tight parsonage , enclosed in its own neat garden , with a vine and a pear - tree trained round its casements ; but upon the marriage of the young ' squire , it had received the improvement of a farm - house elevated into a cottage , for his residence , and Uppercross Cottage , with its veranda , French windows , and other prettiness , was quite as likely to catch the traveller 's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House , about a quarter of a mile farther on . 
Anne Elliot	patient	sunk	While well , and happy , and properly attended to , she had great good humour and excellent spirits ; but any indisposition sunk her completely . 
Anne Elliot	patient	greeted	"She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing - room , the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby , under the influence of four summers and two children ; and , on Anne 's appearing , greeted her with-- "" So , you are come at last ! "

Anne Elliot	patient	assure	"It is early . "" "" I never want them , I assure you . "
Anne Elliot	patient	sent	"It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday . "" "" My dear Mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself ! "
Anne Elliot	patient	assure	"what can you possibly have to do ? "" "" A great many things , I assure you . "
Anne Elliot	patient	told	I have had all my own little concerns to arrange , books and music to divide , and all my trunks to repack , from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons : and one thing I have had to do , Mary , of a more trying nature : going to almost every house in the parish , as a sort of take - leave . I was told that they wished it . But all these things took up a great deal of time . 
Anne Elliot	patient	obliged	I have made no enquiries , because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party . 
Anne Elliot	patient	took	""" Nothing remarkable . One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one 's own . Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me , and we were so crowded ! They are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward . "
Anne Elliot	patient	see	""" I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you ? "
Anne Elliot	patient	gone	"She had never been staying there before , without being struck by it , or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown , or unconsidered there , were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest ; yet , with all this experience , she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson , in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle , was become necessary for her ; for certainly , coming as she did , with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks , she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove : "" So , Miss Anne , Sir Walter and your sister are gone ; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in ? "" and this , without much waiting for an answer ; or in the young ladies ' addition of , "" I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter ; but remember , papa , if we do go , we must be in a good situation : none of your Queen Squares for us ! "" or in the anxious supplement from Mary , of-- "" Upon my word , I shall be pretty well off , when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath ! "
Anne Elliot	patient	treated	One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties , and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house . 
Anne Elliot	patient	requested	"Known to have some influence with her sister , she was continually requested , or at least receiving hints to exert it , beyond what was practicable . "" I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill , "" was Charles 's language ; and , in an unhappy mood , thus spoke Mary : "" I do believe if Charles were to see me dying , he would not think there was anything the matter with me . "
Anne Elliot	patient	assure	I assure you , Miss Anne , it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should . 
Anne Elliot	patient	used	In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world ; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's fond partiality for their own daughters ' performance , and total indifference to any other person 's , gave her much more pleasure for their sakes , than mortification for her own . 
Anne Elliot	patient	driving	"She should put it off as long as she could ; "" but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on an early day , and was in a very animated , comfortable state of imaginary agitation , when she came back . "
Anne Elliot	patient	pleased	"Anne gave her credit , indeed , for feelings of great consideration towards herself , in all that related to Kellynch , and it pleased her : especially , as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute , in the instant even of introduction , that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft 's side , to give a bias of any sort . She was quite easy on that head , and consequently full of strength and courage , till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft 's suddenly saying,-- "" It was you , and not your sister , I find , that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with , when he was in this country .

They were gone , she hoped , to be happy , however oddly constructed such happiness might seem ; as for herself , she was left with as many sensations of comfort , as were , perhaps , ever likely to be hers .

Anne Elliot	patient	seeing	He wished to avoid seeing her . 
Anne Elliot	patient	known	""" So altered that he should not have known her again ! "" "
Anne Elliot	patient	forgiven	Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them . They were of sobering tendency ; they allayed agitation ; they composed , and consequently must make her happier . Frederick Wentworth had used such words , or something like them , but without an idea that they would be carried round to her . He had thought her wretchedly altered , and in the first moment of appeal , had spoken as he felt . He had not forgiven Anne Elliot . She had used him ill , deserted and disappointed him ; and worse , she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so , which his own decided , confident temper could not endure . 
Anne Elliot	patient	meeting	He had been most warmly attached to her , and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal ; but , except from some natural sensation of curiosity , he had no desire of meeting her again . Her power with him was gone for ever . It was now his object to marry . 
Anne Elliot	patient	reminded	"There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party ; and he was very much questioned , and especially by the two Miss Musgroves , who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him , as to the manner of living on board , daily regulations , food , hours , & c. , and their surprise at his accounts , at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable , drew from him some pleasant ridicule , which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant , and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat , or any cook to dress it if there were , or any servant to wait , or any knife and fork to use . From thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Musgrove 's who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying-- "" Ah ! "

Anne Elliot	patient	convinced	"I assure you , Captain Wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you . "" There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth 's face at this speech , a certain glance of his bright eye , and curl of his handsome mouth , which convinced Anne , that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove 's kind wishes , as to her son , he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him ; but it was too transient an indulgence of self - amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself ; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious , and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa , on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting , took a place by the latter , and entered into conversation with her , in a low voice , about her son , doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace , as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent 's feelings . They were actually on the same sofa , for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him ; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove . "
Anne Elliot	patient	occupied	The Miss Hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for Henrietta and Louisa , they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good - will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals . If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ? These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne , while her fingers were mechanically at work , proceeding for half an hour together , equally without error , and without consciousness . Once she felt that he was looking at herself , observing her altered features , perhaps , trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him ; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her ; she was hardly aware of it , till she heard the answer ; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced ? 
Anne Elliot	patient	saw	"Unintentionally she returned to that part of the room ; he saw her , and , instantly rising , said , with studied politeness-- "" I beg your pardon , madam , this is your seat ; "" and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative , he was not to be induced to sit down again . Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches . "
Anne Elliot	patient	left	He had been absent only two Sundays , and when they parted , had left her interested , even to the height of his wishes , in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy , and obtaining that of Uppercross instead . It had then seemed the object nearest her heart , that Dr Shirley , the rector , who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office , but was now growing too infirm for many of them , should be quite fixed on engaging a curate ; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford , and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it . The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross , instead of going six miles another way ; of his having , in every respect , a better curacy ; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley , and of dear , good Dr Shirley 's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue , had been a great deal , even to Louisa , but had been almost everything to Henrietta . When he came back , alas ! 
Anne Elliot	patient	called	"The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot , deprived his manners of their usual composure : he started , and could only say , "" I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here : Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here , "" before he walked to the window to recollect himself , and feel how he ought to behave . "" They are up stairs with my sister : they will be down in a few moments , I dare say , "" had been Anne 's reply , in all the confusion that was natural ; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him , she would have been out of the room the next moment , and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself .

Anne Elliot	patient	obliged	She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa , and remain there to satisfy her patient ; and thus they continued a few minutes , when , to her very great satisfaction , she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule . 
Anne Elliot	patient	join	"It was a very fine November day , and the Miss Musgroves came through the little grounds , and stopped for no other purpose than to say , that they were going to take a long walk , and therefore concluded Mary could not like to go with them ; and when Mary immediately replied , with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker , "" Oh , yes , I should like to join you very much , I am very fond of a long walk ; "" Anne felt persuaded , by the looks of the two girls , that it was precisely what they did not wish , and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce , of everything being to be communicated , and everything being to be done together , however undesired and inconvenient . "
Anne Elliot	patient	struck	This distinction appeared to increase , and there was one speech of Louisa 's which struck her . 
Anne Elliot	patient	honour	"You make the most of it , I know , "" cried Louisa , "" but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place . If I loved a man , as she loves the Admiral , I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else . "" It was spoken with enthusiasm . "" Had you ? "" cried he , catching the same tone ; "" I honour you ! "" "
Anne Elliot	patient	roused	"The sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by , unless some tender sonnet , fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year , with declining happiness , and the images of youth and hope , and spring , all gone together , blessed her memory . She roused herself to say , as they struck by order into another path , "" Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop ? "
Anne Elliot	patient	answered	But nobody heard , or , at least , nobody answered her . 
Anne Elliot	patient	surprised	""" He had done , and was unanswered . It would have surprised Anne if Louisa could have readily answered such a speech : words of such interest , spoken with such serious warmth ! "
Anne Elliot	patient	married	We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead . 
Anne Elliot	patient	marry	I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne ? 
Anne Elliot	patient	liked	I wish she had accepted him . We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell 's doing , that she did not . 
Anne Elliot	patient	persuaded	"They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell , and that therefore , she persuaded Anne to refuse him . "" The sounds were retreating , and Anne distinguished no more . "
Anne Elliot	patient	kept	Her own emotions still kept her fixed . 
Anne Elliot	patient	incommoded	Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him , and was now to reap the consequence , which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch ; and when Mary began to complain of it , and lament her being ill - used , according to custom , in being on the hedge side , while Anne was never incommoded on the other , he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of , and they could hardly get him along at all . 
Anne Elliot	patient	taking	""" Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home . "
Anne Elliot	patient	assure	Here is excellent room for three , I assure you . 
Anne Elliot	patient	allowed	"You must , indeed , you must . "" Anne was still in the lane ; and though instinctively beginning to decline , she was not allowed to proceed . "
Anne Elliot	patient	persuaded	""" "" We had better not talk about it , my dear , "" replied Mrs Croft , pleasantly ; "" for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding , she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together . "
Anne Elliot	patient	resettled	: the day was even fixed ; and Anne , being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled , was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch , and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it . 
Anne Elliot	patient	place	It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth , within half a mile of him ; they would have to frequent the same church , and there must be intercourse between the two families . 
Anne Elliot	patient	considered	This was against her ; but on the other hand , he spent so much of his time at Uppercross , that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind , than as going towards him ; and , upon the whole , she believed she must , on this interesting question , be the gainer , almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society , in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell 
Anne Elliot	patient	stationed	They did not like each other , and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good ; and were Lady Russell to see them together , she might think that he had too much self - possession , and she too little . These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross , where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough . 
Anne Elliot	patient	convinced	"when they quitted the house ; and Louisa , by whom she found herself walking , burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy ; their friendliness , their brotherliness , their openness , their uprightness ; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England ; that they only knew how to live , and they only deserved to be respected and loved . They went back to dress and dine ; and so well had the scheme answered already , that nothing was found amiss ; though its being "" so entirely out of season , "" and the "" no thoroughfare of Lyme , "" and the "" no expectation of company , "" had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn . "
Anne Elliot	patient	obliged	While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to Anne 's lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him . 
Anne Elliot	patient	repaid	He was shy , and disposed to abstraction ; but the engaging mildness of her countenance , and gentleness of her manners , soon had their effect ; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion . He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading , though principally in poetry ; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening 's indulgence in the discussion of subjects , which his usual companions had probably no concern in , she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction , which had naturally grown out of their conversation . For , though shy , he did not seem reserved ; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints ; and having talked of poetry , the richness of the present age , and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first - rate poets , trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred , and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos ; and moreover , how the Giaour was to be pronounced , he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet , and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other ; he repeated , with such tremulous feeling , the various lines which imaged a broken heart , or a mind destroyed by wretchedness , and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood , that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry , and to say , that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely ; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly . His looks shewing him not pained , but pleased with this allusion to his situation , she was emboldened to go on ; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind , she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study ; and on being requested to particularize , mentioned such works of our best moralists , such collections of the finest letters , such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering , as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts , and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances . Captain Benwick listened attentively , and seemed grateful for the interest implied ; and though with a shake of the head , and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his , noted down the names of those she recommended , and promised to procure and read them

Anne Elliot	patient	amused	When the evening was over , Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination . 
Anne Elliot	patient	told	"I am afraid of her , as I have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but I respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross . "" "
Anne Elliot	patient	amused	Anne was amused by Henrietta 's manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta 's views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them . 
Anne Elliot	patient	admired	She was looking remarkably well ; her very regular , very pretty features , having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion , and by the animation of eye which it had also produced . It was evident that the gentleman , ( completely a gentleman in manner ) admired her exceedingly . 
Anne Elliot	patient	introduced	""" Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together , "" said Captain Wentworth , "" we must consider it to be the arrangement of Providence , that you should not be introduced to your cousin . "" "
Anne Elliot	patient	seek	Their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again ; and they walked together some time , talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron , and still as unable as before , and as unable as any other two readers , to think exactly alike of the merits of either , till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party , and instead of Captain Benwick , she had Captain Harville by her side .

Anne Elliot	patient	Leave	Leave me , and go to him . 
Anne Elliot	patient	nurse	""" You will stay , I am sure ; you will stay and nurse her ; "" cried he , turning to her and speaking with a glow , and yet a gentleness , which seemed almost restoring the past . "
Anne Elliot	patient	expressed	She expressed herself most willing , ready , happy to remain . 
Anne Elliot	patient	astonished	Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon . 
Anne Elliot	patient	spend	They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that Anne was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence . She was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character . A few days had made a change indeed ! If Louisa recovered , it would all be well again .

Anne Elliot	patient	meeting	There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell 's joy in meeting her . 
Anne Elliot	patient	improved	She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross . But happily , either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks , or Lady Russell fancied her so ; and Anne , in receiving her compliments on the occasion , had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin , and of hoping that she was to be blessed with

Anne Elliot	patient	forced	Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father 's house in Camden Place , or her own sister 's intimacy with Mrs Clay . She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her .

Anne Elliot	patient	telling	She could not speak the name , and look straight forward to Lady Russell 's eye , till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa . 
Anne Elliot	patient	distressed	When this was told , his name distressed her no longer .

Anne Elliot	patient	suits	""" "" Well , whenever it suits you . You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time ; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door . "

Anne Elliot	patient	told	We told you about the laundry - door , at Uppercross . 
Anne Elliot	patient	grant	The breakfast - room chimney smokes a little , I grant you , but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard , which may not happen three times a winter . 
Anne Elliot	patient	acknowledged	"and he had not courage to come . That is the fact , upon my honour , Mary knows it is . "" But Mary did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot , or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed . Anne 's good - will , however , was not to be lessened by what she heard . She boldly acknowledged herself flattered , and continued her enquiries . "" Oh ! "
Anne Elliot	patient	mention	""" I declare , Charles , I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there . "
Anne Elliot	patient	spoken	I can not pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine -- I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it ; and then ` Miss Elliot ' was spoken of in the highest terms ! 
Anne Elliot	patient	got	But Mrs Musgrove , who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially , again and again , for all her attentions to them , concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing , with a happy glance round the room , that after all she had gone through , nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home .

Anne Elliot	patient	see	Anne did not share these feelings . She persisted in a very determined , though very silent disinclination for Bath ; caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings , smoking in rain , without any wish of seeing them better ; felt their progress through the streets to be , however disagreeable , yet too rapid ; for who would be glad to see her when she arrived ? 
Anne Elliot	patient	animated	If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch , he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree . Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance , but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not , which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath . 
Anne Elliot	patient	see	Her father and sister were glad to see her , for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture , and met her with kindness .

Anne Elliot	patient	assuring	They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered their expectations in every respect . 
Anne Elliot	patient	engaged	His enquiries , however , produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there , soon after his leaving the place . 
Anne Elliot	patient	come	"She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said , that "" now Miss Anne was come , she could not suppose herself at all wanted ; "" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper , "" That must not be any reason , indeed . "
Anne Elliot	patient	assure	I assure you I feel it none . 
Anne Elliot	patient	told	"As Mr Elliot became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others . His manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told Anne , almost ready to exclaim , "" Can this be Mr Elliot ? "" and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man . "
Anne Elliot	patient	surprise	It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently ; and it did not surprise her , therefore , that Lady Russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent , nothing to require more motives than appeared , in Mr Elliot 's great desire of a reconciliation . In Lady Russell 's view , it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot , at a mature time of life , should feel it a most desirable object , and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people , to be on good terms with the head of his family ; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear , and only erring in the heyday of youth . 
Anne Elliot	patient	gave	He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness . She knew it well ; and she remembered another person 's look also . 
Anne Elliot	patient	known	You may depend upon it , that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter , and as rank is rank , your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family ( our family let me say ) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for . 
Anne Elliot	patient	recollecting	"then recollecting herself , and not wishing to be answered , she added , "" I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance . I suppose "" ( smiling ) "" I have more pride than any of you ; but I confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them .

Anne Elliot	patient	defeating	""" He looked , as he spoke , to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately occupying : a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant ; and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride , she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay ; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father 's getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her . "
Anne Elliot	patient	changed	Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming , silent , unformed girl of fifteen , to the elegant little woman of seven - and - twenty , with every beauty except bloom , and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle ; and twelve years had transformed the fine - looking , well - grown Miss Hamilton , in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority , into a poor , infirm , helpless widow , receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour ; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away , and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times . 
Anne Elliot	patient	connect	She had no child to connect her with life and happiness again , no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs , no health to make all the rest supportable . 
Anne Elliot	patient	carried	She watched , observed , reflected , and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only . A submissive spirit might be patient , a strong understanding would supply resolution , but here was something more ; here was that elasticity of mind , that disposition to be comforted , that power of turning readily from evil to good , and of finding employment which carried her out of herself , which was from nature alone . 
Anne Elliot	patient	told	There had been a time , Mrs Smith told her , when her spirits had nearly failed . She could not call herself an invalid now , compared with her state on first reaching Bath .

Mrs Smith ! "
Anne Elliot	patient	prevented	Mrs Clay , who had been present while all this passed , now thought it advisable to leave the room , and Anne could have said much , and did long to say a little in defence of her friend 's not very dissimilar claims to theirs , but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her . 
Anne Elliot	patient	given	Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot . He thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence . He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits ; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend , could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man , without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create . Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot .

Anne Elliot	patient	brought	The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself brought Anne to composure again . 
Anne Elliot	patient	captivate	Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still . 
Anne Elliot	patient	hold	He had spoken to her with some degree of openness of Mrs Clay ; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was about , and to hold her in contempt ; and yet Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body . Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend , for she saw nothing to excite distrust . She could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot ; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church , in the course of the following autumn . Chapter 18 It was the beginning of February ; and Anne , having been a month in Bath , was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme .

Anne Elliot	patient	took	Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the Admiral 's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her . Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft 's arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend 's carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral .

Anne Elliot	patient	interrupted	"She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other , not at all to represent Captain Benwick 's manners as the very best that could possibly be ; and , after a little hesitation , she was beginning to say , "" I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends , "" but the Admiral interrupted her with-- "" And the thing is certainly true . It is not a mere bit of gossip . "
Anne Elliot	patient	satisfied	She therefore satisfied herself with common - place remarks or quiet attention , and the Admiral had it all his own way . 
Anne Elliot	patient	lost	For a few minutes she saw nothing before her ; it was all confusion . She was lost , and when she had scolded back her senses , she found the others still waiting for the carriage , and Mr Elliot ( always obliging ) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs Clay 's . She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door ; she wanted to see if it rained . 
Anne Elliot	patient	suspect	Why was she to suspect herself of another motive ? 
Anne Elliot	patient	sent	She was sent back , however , in a moment by the entrance of Captain Wentworth himself , among a party of gentlemen and ladies , evidently his acquaintance , and whom he must have joined a little below Milsom Street . 
Anne Elliot	patient	grieved	He looked very well , not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits , and he talked of Uppercross , of the Musgroves , nay , even of Louisa , and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her ; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable , not easy , not able to feign that he was . It did not surprise , but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him . 
Anne Elliot	patient	convinced	She saw that he saw Elizabeth , that Elizabeth saw him , that there was complete internal recognition on each side ; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance , expecting it , and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness . 
Anne Elliot	patient	admiring	"There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme , admiring Anne as she passed , except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend . He came in with eagerness , appeared to see and think only of her , apologised for his stay , was grieved to have kept her waiting , and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased ; and in another moment they walked off together , her arm under his , a gentle and embarrassed glance , and a "" Good morning to you ! "" being all that she had time for , as she passed away . "

Anne Elliot	patient	obliged	""" Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin , if he would have walked by her side all the way to Camden Place , without saying a word . "
Anne Elliot	patient	obliged	How would it all be ? She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick . 
Anne Elliot	patient	telling	""" You will wonder , "" said she , "" what has been fixing my eye so long ; but I was looking after some window - curtains , which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night . "
Anne Elliot	patient	provoked	Anne sighed and blushed and smiled , in pity and disdain , either at her friend or herself . The part which provoked her most , was that in all this waste of foresight and caution , she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them . 
Anne Elliot	patient	excused	She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her ; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off , with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow . 
Anne Elliot	patient	leave	"After talking , however , of the weather , and Bath , and the concert , their conversation began to flag , and so little was said at last , that she was expecting him to go every moment , but he did not ; he seemed in no hurry to leave her ; and presently with renewed spirit , with a little smile , a little glow , he said-- "" I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme . "

The others joined them , and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included . She was divided from Captain Wentworth . "

Anne Elliot	patient	gave	Their interesting , almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time , but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on ! She had learnt , in the last ten minutes , more of his feelings towards Louisa , more of all his feelings than she dared to think of ; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party , to the needful civilities of the moment , with exquisite , though agitated sensations . 
Anne Elliot	patient	disposed	She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all , and to pity every one , as being less happy than herself . 
Anne Elliot	patient	find	He would look for her , he would find her out before the evening were over , and at present , perhaps , it was as well to be asunder . 
Anne Elliot	patient	love	He must love her . 
Anne Elliot	patient	flurried	These were thoughts , with their attendant visions , which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation ; and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him , without even trying to discern him . 
Anne Elliot	patient	regard	""" I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long , "" replied he , "" without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot ; and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments , and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman . "
Anne Elliot	patient	assure	He would mention no names now ; but such , he could assure her , had been the fact . 
Anne Elliot	patient	know	He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her . 
Anne Elliot	patient	forced	It seemed as if she had been one moment too late ; and as long as she dared observe , he did not look again : but the performance was recommencing , and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward . 
Anne Elliot	patient	distressed	Mr Elliot 's speech , too , distressed her . 
Anne Elliot	patient	persuaded	She was persuaded by Lady Russell 's countenance that she had seen him . He did not come however . 
Anne Elliot	patient	enabled	Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again , and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret , in a manner not to be refused , to sit between them ; and by some other removals , and a little scheming of her own , Anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before , much more within reach of a passer - by .

Anne Elliot	patient	comparing	She could not do so , without comparing herself with Miss Larolles , the inimitable Miss Larolles ; but still she did it , and not with much happier effect ; though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours , she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed . Such was her situation , with a vacant space at hand , when Captain Wentworth was again in sight . She saw him not far off .

Such was her situation , with a vacant space at hand , when Captain Wentworth was again in sight . She saw him not far off . 
Anne Elliot	patient	saw	He saw her too ; yet he looked grave , and seemed irresolute , and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her . She felt that something must be the matter . The change was indubitable . The difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room was strikingly great . 
Anne Elliot	patient	obliged	They talked for a few minutes more ; the improvement held ; he even looked down towards the bench , as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying ; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round . 
Anne Elliot	patient	applied	He begged her pardon , but she must be applied to , to explain Italian again . 
Anne Elliot	patient	engage	Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith , meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call ; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object . 
Anne Elliot	patient	interest	She felt a great deal of good - will towards him . In spite of the mischief of his attentions , she owed him gratitude and regard , perhaps compassion . She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance , of the right which he seemed to have to interest her , by everything in situation , by his own sentiments , by his early prepossession . 
Anne Elliot	patient	divide	Their union , she believed , could not divide her more from other men , than their final separation . Prettier musings of high - wrought love and eternal constancy , could never have passed along the streets of Bath , than Anne was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings . It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way . 
Anne Elliot	patient	expected	She was sure of a pleasant reception ; and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming , seemed hardly to have expected her , though it had been an appointment . 
Anne Elliot	patient	employed	""" No , no ; you were better employed . You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening . "
Anne Elliot	patient	tell	""" No , no ; you were better employed . You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening . "
Anne Elliot	patient	interests	Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world , the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together . 
Anne Elliot	patient	reached	"She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend 's penetration , unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her . After another short silence-- "" Pray , "" said Mrs Smith , "" is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ? Does he know that I am in Bath ? "
Anne Elliot	patient	considering	""" I should be extremely happy ; I hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you , "" replied Anne ; "" but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case . "
Anne Elliot	patient	consider	You must consider me only as Mr Elliot 's relation . 
Anne Elliot	patient	employ	"If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me . "" Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance , and then , smiling , said-- "" I have been a little premature , I perceive ; I beg your pardon . "
Anne Elliot	patient	assure	I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week . 
Anne Elliot	patient	understood	"I should like to know why you imagine I am ? "" Mrs Smith looked at her again , looked earnestly , smiled , shook her head , and exclaimed-- "" Now , how I do wish I understood you ! "
Anne Elliot	patient	married	Do not forget me when you are married , that 's all . 
Anne Elliot	patient	tell	Then do tell me what he was at that time of life . 
Anne Elliot	patient	command	But I will try to command myself . I will not abuse him . 
Anne Elliot	patient	described	It was curious , that having just left you behind me in Bath , my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin ; and that , through him , I should be continually hearing of your father and sister . He described one Miss Elliot , and I thought very affectionately of the other . 
Anne Elliot	patient	checked	"I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot , and vouch for your being a very different creature from-- "" She checked herself just in time . "
Anne Elliot	patient	interrupted	But I beg your pardon ; I have interrupted you . 
Anne Elliot	patient	desired	Anne , seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it , did as she was desired . 
Anne Elliot	patient	putting	"and I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again , meaning , for the rest of my life , to be only yours truly,--Wm . Elliot . "" Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow ; and Mrs Smith , observing the high colour in her face , said-- "" The language , I know , is highly disrespectful . Though I have forgot the exact terms , I have a perfect impression of the general meaning . "
Anne Elliot	patient	obliged	"She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour , that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies , that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others , before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over , and say-- "" Thank you . "
Anne Elliot	patient	marry	He truly wants to marry you . 
Anne Elliot	patient	acquainted	"you are acquainted with him ? "" "" No . "
Anne Elliot	patient	let	On Monday evening , my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings . 
Anne Elliot	patient	seen	He had seen you indeed , before he came to Bath , and admired you , but without knowing it to be you . 
Anne Elliot	patient	admired	He had seen you indeed , before he came to Bath , and admired you , but without knowing it to be you . 
Anne Elliot	patient	see	"Did he see you last summer or autumn , ` somewhere down in the west , ' to use her own words , without knowing it to be you ? "" "" He certainly did . "
Anne Elliot	patient	saw	He saw you then at Lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place , as Miss Anne Elliot , and from that moment , I have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there . 
Anne Elliot	patient	liked	He saw you then at Lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place , as Miss Anne Elliot , and from that moment , I have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there . 
Anne Elliot	patient	surprises	The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting , but I have heard nothing which really surprises me . 
Anne Elliot	patient	shewn	Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion , answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith , which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble , and , under a cold civility , the same hard - hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her . 
Anne Elliot	patient	assist	She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel , and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law . 
Anne Elliot	patient	persuaded	""" Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed . It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell ! "
Anne Elliot	patient	tell	Mrs Smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done . 
Anne Elliot	patient	congratulated	She found , on reaching home , that she had , as she intended , escaped seeing Mr Elliot ; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit ; but hardly had she congratulated herself , and felt safe , when she heard that he was coming again in the evening . 
Anne Elliot	patient	used	She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere , but now she saw insincerity in everything . 
Anne Elliot	patient	see	Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning ; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary , to go and see her and Henrietta directly . Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present . 
Anne Elliot	patient	convinced	They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes ; but Anne convinced herself that a day 's delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence , and hastened forward to the White Hart , to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn , with an eagerness of good - will which many associations contributed to form . 
Anne Elliot	patient	entreated	It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on Charles 's leaving them together , was listening to Mrs Musgrove 's history of Louisa , and to Henrietta 's of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which Mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill - used by anybody ; which Mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining . 
Anne Elliot	patient	embarrassed	"He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to - morrow . "" As she spoke , she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her , the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her , and made her regret that she had said so much , simple as it was . Mary , resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin , began talking very warmly about the family features , and protesting still more positively that it was Mr Elliot , calling again upon Anne to come and look for herself , but Anne did not mean to stir , and tried to be cool and unconcerned . "
Anne Elliot	patient	concerning	Her distress returned , however , on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors , as if they believed themselves quite in the secret . It was evident that the report concerning her had spread , and a short pause succeeded , which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther . 
Anne Elliot	patient	acquitted	"She was just in time to ascertain that it really was Mr Elliot , which she had never believed , before he disappeared on one side , as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other ; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest , she calmly said , "" Yes , it is Mr Elliot , certainly . He has changed his hour of going , I suppose , that is all , or I may be mistaken , I might not attend ; "" and walked back to her chair , recomposed , and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well . "
Anne Elliot	patient	losing	"It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father 's ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us . "" "
Anne Elliot	patient	gave	"Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness ; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying-- "" If it depended only on my inclination , ma'am , the party at home ( excepting on Mary 's account ) would not be the smallest impediment . "
Anne Elliot	patient	changed	""" I am not yet so much changed , "" cried Anne , and stopped , fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction . "
Anne Elliot	patient	startled	Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne 's imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour ; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered , she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta , eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out , and calling on her companions to lose no time , lest somebody else should come in . 
Anne Elliot	patient	pity	Anne talked of being perfectly ready , and tried to look it ; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair , in preparing to quit the room , she would have found , in all her own sensations for her cousin , in the very security of his affection , wherewith to pity her . Their preparations , however , were stopped short . 
Anne Elliot	patient	vex	Anne caught his eye , saw his cheeks glow , and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt , and turned away , that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her . 
Anne Elliot	patient	begged	She was earnestly begged to return and dine , and give them all the rest of the day , but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more , and fit only for home , where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose . 
Anne Elliot	patient	harassing	Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning , therefore , she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place , there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow 's party , the frequent enumeration of the persons invited , and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath , while harassing herself with the never - ending question , of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not ? 
Anne Elliot	patient	roused	She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation , to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath , for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself , she determined to mention it , and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs Clay 's face as she listened .

Anne Elliot	patient	keep	The party before her were , Mrs Musgrove , talking to Mrs Croft , and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth ; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta , too impatient to wait , had gone out the moment it had cleared , but would be back again soon , and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned . She had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed . There was no delay , no waste of time . 
Anne Elliot	patient	inviting	She felt its application to herself , felt it in a nervous thrill all over her ; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table , Captain Wentworth 's pen ceased to move , his head was raised , pausing , listening , and he turned round the next instant to give a look , one quick , conscious look at her . The two ladies continued to talk , to re - urge the same admitted truths , and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation , but Anne heard nothing distinctly ; it was only a buzz of words in her ear , her mind was in confusion . Captain Harville , who had in truth been hearing none of it , now left his seat , and moved to a window , and Anne seeming to watch him , though it was from thorough absence of mind , became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood . 
Anne Elliot	patient	roused	She roused herself and went to him . 
Anne Elliot	patient	authorise	"I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental ; and that as our bodies are the strongest , so are our feelings ; capable of bearing most rough usage , and riding out the heaviest weather . "" "" Your feelings may be the strongest , "" replied Anne , "" but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender . "
Anne Elliot	patient	resemble	""" Oh ! "" cried Anne eagerly , "" I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you . "
Anne Elliot	patient	allowed	No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as -- if I may be allowed the expression -- so long as you have an object . 
Anne Elliot	patient	convinced	"The chair was earnestly protested against , and Mrs Musgrove , who thought only of one sort of illness , having assured herself with some anxiety , that there had been no fall in the case ; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down , and got a blow on her head ; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall ; could part with her cheerfully , and depend on finding her better at night . Anxious to omit no possible precaution , Anne struggled , and said-- "" I am afraid , ma'am , that it is not perfectly understood . Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening . "

Anne Elliot	patient	promise	"Do promise me . "" "" To be sure I will , if you wish it . "
Anne Elliot	patient	command	Anne could command herself enough to receive that look , and not repulsively . 
Anne Elliot	patient	altered	"He enquired after you very particularly ; asked even if you were personally altered , little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter . "" "
Anne Elliot	patient	suspected	""" You should not have suspected me now ; the case is so different , and my age is so different . "
Anne Elliot	patient	mistake	Do not mistake me , however . 
Anne Elliot	patient	reproach	"But I mean , that I was right in submitting to her , and that if I had done otherwise , I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up , because I should have suffered in my conscience . I have now , as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature , nothing to reproach myself with ; and if I mistake not , a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman 's portion . "" He looked at her , looked at Lady Russell , and looking again at her , replied , as if in cool deliberation-- "" Not yet . But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time . "
Anne Elliot	patient	loved	But she was a very good woman , and if her second object was to be sensible and well - judging , her first was to see Anne happy . She loved Anne better than she loved her own abilities ; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over , found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child . 
Anne Elliot	patient	keeping	It was creditable to have a sister married , and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion , by keeping Anne with her in the autumn ; and as her own sister must be better than her husband 's sisters , it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter . 
Anne Elliot	patient	met	The disproportion in their fortune was nothing ; it did not give her a moment 's regret ; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly , nothing of respectability , of harmony , of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters , was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity . 
Anne Elliot	patient	recommend	Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for Mrs Smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently . 
Anne Elliot	patient	depriving	Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves , and their marriage , instead of depriving her of one friend , secured her two . 
Anne Elliot	patient	putting	She was their earliest visitor in their settled life ; and Captain Wentworth , by putting her in the way of recovering her husband 's property in the West Indies , by writing for her , acting for her , and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend , fully requited the services which she had rendered , or ever meant to render , to his wife .

He was , at that time , a remarkably fine young man , with a great deal of intelligence , spirit , and brilliancy ; and Anne an extremely pretty girl , with gentleness , modesty , taste , and feeling .

Captain Wentworth	agent	knew	He had always been lucky ; he knew he should be so still . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	left	was required , for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions , on his side , totally unconvinced and unbending , and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment . He had left the country in consequence . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	stood	No one had ever come within the Kellynch circle , who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth , as he stood in her memory . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	shewn	"Since he actually was expected in the country , she must teach herself to be insensible on such points . And not only did it appear that he was expected , and speedily , but the Musgroves , in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick , and very high respect for his character , stamped as it was by poor Dick 's having been six months under his care , and mentioning him in strong , though not perfectly well - spelt praise , as "" a fine dashing felow , only two perticular about the schoolmaster , "" were bent on introducing themselves , and seeking his acquaintance , as soon as they could hear of his arrival . The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening . "
Captain Wentworth	agent	felt	She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	wished	Had he wished ever to see her again , he need not have waited till this time ; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago , when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting .

Captain Wentworth	agent	done	Had he wished ever to see her again , he need not have waited till this time ; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago , when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	coming	There had been music , singing , talking , laughing , all that was most agreeable ; charming manners in Captain Wentworth , no shyness or reserve ; they seemed all to know each other perfectly , and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with Charles . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	seemed	He was to come to breakfast , but not at the Cottage , though that had been proposed at first ; but then he had been pressed to come to the Great House instead , and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs Charles Musgrove 's way , on account of the child , and therefore , somehow , they hardly knew how , it ended in Charles 's being to meet him to breakfast at his father 's . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	wished	He wished to avoid seeing her . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	inquired	He had inquired after her , she found , slightly , as might suit a former slight acquaintance , seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged , actuated , perhaps , by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	running	The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child 's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice . Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	talked	Her eye half met Captain Wentworth 's , a bow , a curtsey passed ; she heard his voice ; he talked to Mary , said all that was right , said something to the Miss Musgroves , enough to mark an easy footing ; the room seemed full , full of persons and voices , but a few minutes ended it . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	thought	Henrietta asked him what he thought of you , when they went away , and he said , ` You were so altered he should not have known you again . ' 
Captain Wentworth	agent	said	Henrietta asked him what he thought of you , when they went away , and he said , ` You were so altered he should not have known you again . ' 
Captain Wentworth	agent	used	Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them . They were of sobering tendency ; they allayed agitation ; they composed , and consequently must make her happier . Frederick Wentworth had used such words , or something like them , but without an idea that they would be carried round to her . He had thought her wretchedly altered , and in the first moment of appeal , had spoken as he felt . He had not forgiven Anne Elliot . She had used him ill , deserted and disappointed him ; and worse , she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so , which his own decided , confident temper could not endure . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	commanded	When she could let her attention take its natural course again , she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List ( their own navy list , the first that had ever been at Uppercross ) , and sitting down together to pore over it , with the professed view of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded .

Captain Wentworth	agent	left	it would have been a happy thing , if he had never left you . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	left	"I assure you , Captain Wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you . "" There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth 's face at this speech , a certain glance of his bright eye , and curl of his handsome mouth , which convinced Anne , that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove 's kind wishes , as to her son , he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him ; but it was too transient an indulgence of self - amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself ; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious , and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa , on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting , took a place by the latter , and entered into conversation with her , in a low voice , about her son , doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace , as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent 's feelings . They were actually on the same sofa , for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him ; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove . "
Captain Wentworth	agent	attended	Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable , substantial size , infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour , than tenderness and sentiment ; and while the agitations of Anne 's slender form , and pensive face , may be considered as very completely screened , Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self - command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son , whom alive nobody had cared for . Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions .

Captain Wentworth	agent	had	The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come , particularly in the morning , when he had no companion at home , for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together , interesting themselves in their new possessions , their grass , and their sheep , and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person , or driving out in a gig , lately added to their establishment .

Captain Wentworth	agent	considered	She saw how her own character was considered by Captain Wentworth , and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	seem	The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand ; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman 's side , and a relenting on the lady 's , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt . Henrietta looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased;-- Charles Hayter exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross . Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	cleared	The walking party had crossed the lane , and were surmounting an opposite stile , and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again , when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister . The something might be guessed by its effects .

Captain Wentworth	agent	spent	This was against her ; but on the other hand , he spent so much of his time at Uppercross , that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind , than as going towards him ; and , upon the whole , she believed she must , on this interesting question , be the gainer , almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society , in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell 
Captain Wentworth	agent	had	They did not like each other , and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good ; and were Lady Russell to see them together , she might think that he had too much self - possession , and she too little . These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross , where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough .

Captain Wentworth	agent	had	but he was gaining strength apace , and she had nothing else to stay for . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	appeared	Captain Wentworth , after being unseen and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days , appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	go	Captain Harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before , and Captain Wentworth 's anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	talked	Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself , it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross ; though November , the weather was by no means bad ; and , in short , Louisa , who was the most eager of the eager , having formed the resolution to go , and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked , being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way , bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer ; and to Lyme they were to go -- Charles , Mary , Anne , Henrietta , Louisa , and Captain Wentworth . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	turned	The rooms were shut up , the lodgers almost all gone , scarcely any family but of the residents left ; and , as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves , the remarkable situation of the town , the principal street almost hurrying into the water , the walk to the Cobb , skirting round the pleasant little bay , which , in the season , is animated with bathing machines and company ; the Cobb itself , its old wonders and new improvements , with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town , are what the stranger 's eye will seek ; and a very strange stranger it must be , who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme , to make him wish to know it better . The scenes in its neighbourhood , Charmouth , with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country , and still more , its sweet , retired bay , backed by dark cliffs , where fragments of low rock among the sands , make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide , for sitting in unwearied contemplation ; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme ; and , above all , Pinny , with its green chasms between romantic rocks , where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth , declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state , where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited , as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far - famed Isle of Wight : these places must be visited , and visited again , to make the worth of Lyme understood . The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms , and still descending , soon found themselves on the sea - shore ; and lingering only , as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea , who ever deserved to look on it at all , proceeded towards the Cobb , equally their object in itself and on Captain Wentworth 's account : for in a small house , near the foot of an old pier of unknown date , were the Harvilles settled . Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend ; the others walked on , and he was to join them on the Cobb . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	coming	They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring ; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long , when they saw him coming after them , with three companions , all well known already , by description , to be Captain and Mrs Harville , and a Captain Benwick , who was staying with them . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	given	Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia ; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him , on his return from Lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	considered	Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville , or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change . He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily , uniting very strong feelings with quiet , serious , and retiring manners , and a decided taste for reading , and sedentary pursuits . To finish the interest of the story , the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed , if possible , augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance , and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	coming	Anne was amused by Henrietta 's manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta 's views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them .

There was no wound , no blood , no visible bruise ; but her eyes were closed , she breathed not , her face was like death . The horror of the moment to all who stood around ! 
Captain Wentworth	agent	knelt	Captain Wentworth , who had caught her up , knelt with her in his arms , looking on her with a face as pallid as her own , in an agony of silence . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	caught	"He caught the word ; it seemed to rouse him at once , and saying only-- "" True , true , a surgeon this instant , "" was darting away , when Anne eagerly suggested-- "" Captain Benwick , would not it be better for Captain Benwick ?

Captain Wentworth	agent	appearing	The intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger . Every report agreed in Captain Wentworth 's appearing fixed in Lyme . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	enquired	The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ) , had brought Anne the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more . He had enquired after her , she found , particularly ; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot 's not being the worse for her exertions , and had spoken of those exertions as great . This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done . As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove 's recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter !

Captain Wentworth	agent	looked	He looked very well , not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits , and he talked of Uppercross , of the Musgroves , nay , even of Louisa , and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her ; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable , not easy , not able to feign that he was .

Captain Wentworth	agent	saw	She saw that he saw Elizabeth , that Elizabeth saw him , that there was complete internal recognition on each side ; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance , expecting it , and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	turned	At last Miss Elliot and her friend , unattended but by the servant , ( for there was no cousin returned ) , were walking off ; and Captain Wentworth , watching them , turned again to Anne , and by manner , rather than words , was offering his services to her .

Captain Wentworth	agent	recollected	Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	came	"There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme , admiring Anne as she passed , except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend . He came in with eagerness , appeared to see and think only of her , apologised for his stay , was grieved to have kept her waiting , and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased ; and in another moment they walked off together , her arm under his , a gentle and embarrassed glance , and a "" Good morning to you ! "" being all that she had time for , as she passed away . "
Captain Wentworth	agent	walked	But hardly were they so settled , when the door opened again , and Captain Wentworth walked in alone . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	preparing	"He was preparing only to bow and pass on , but her gentle "" How do you do ? "" brought him out of the straight line to stand near her , and make enquiries in return , in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground . "

Captain Wentworth	agent	making	Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne ; she knew nothing of their looks , and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done . While they were speaking , a whispering between her father and Elizabeth caught her ear . She could not distinguish , but she must guess the subject ; and on Captain Wentworth 's making a distant bow , she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance , and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	joined	The delightful emotions were a little subdued , when on stepping back from the group , to be joined again by Captain Wentworth , she saw that he was gone . She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room .

Captain Wentworth	agent	look	It seemed as if she had been one moment too late ; and as long as she dared observe , he did not look again : but the performance was recommencing , and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	moved	When she could give another glance , he had moved away . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	come	She was persuaded by Lady Russell 's countenance that she had seen him . He did not come however . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	came	Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance , but he never came . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	saw	He saw her too ; yet he looked grave , and seemed irresolute , and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her .

Captain Wentworth	agent	replied	Anne replied , and spoke in defence of the performance so well , and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly , that his countenance improved , and he replied again with almost a smile . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	looked	They talked for a few minutes more ; the improvement held ; he even looked down towards the bench , as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying ; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round .

Captain Wentworth	agent	looking	"He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to - morrow . "" As she spoke , she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her , the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her , and made her regret that she had said so much , simple as it was . Mary , resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin , began talking very warmly about the family features , and protesting still more positively that it was Mr Elliot , calling again upon Anne to come and look for herself , but Anne did not mean to stir , and tried to be cool and unconcerned .

Captain Wentworth	agent	proceeded	Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne 's imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour ; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered , she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta , eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out , and calling on her companions to lose no time , lest somebody else should come in .

Captain Wentworth	agent	determined	The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about well in her drawing - room . The card was pointedly given , and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared . The interruption had been short , though severe , and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out , but not to Anne . She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed , and of the manner in which it had been received ; a manner of doubtful meaning , of surprise rather than gratification , of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance . She knew him ; she saw disdain in his eye , and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering , as an atonement for all the insolence of the past . Her spirits sank . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	held	He held the card in his hand after they were gone , as if deeply considering it . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	put	"You see he can not put the card out of his hand . "" "
Captain Wentworth	agent	come	Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning , therefore , she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place , there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow 's party , the frequent enumeration of the persons invited , and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath , while harassing herself with the never - ending question , of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not ? 
Captain Wentworth	agent	come	She generally thought he would come , because she generally thought he ought ; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion , as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings . 
Captain Wentworth	agent	said--	"She was deep in the happiness of such misery , or the misery of such happiness , instantly . Two minutes after her entering the room , Captain Wentworth said-- "" We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials .

Captain Wentworth	agent	turned	She felt its application to herself , felt it in a nervous thrill all over her ; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table , Captain Wentworth 's pen ceased to move , his head was raised , pausing , listening , and he turned round the next instant to give a look , one quick , conscious look at her . The two ladies continued to talk , to re - urge the same admitted truths , and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation , but Anne heard nothing distinctly ; it was only a buzz of words in her ear , her mind was in confusion . Captain Harville , who had in truth been hearing none of it , now left his seat , and moved to a window , and Anne seeming to watch him , though it was from thorough absence of mind , became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood .

Captain Wentworth	agent	caught	It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down ; but Anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed , and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them , striving to catch sounds , which yet she did not think he could have caught .

Captain Wentworth	patient	receive	The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child 's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice . Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over .

Captain Wentworth	patient	charmed	The Miss Hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for Henrietta and Louisa , they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good - will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals . If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ? These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne , while her fingers were mechanically at work , proceeding for half an hour together , equally without error , and without consciousness . Once she felt that he was looking at herself , observing her altered features , perhaps , trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him ; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her ; she was hardly aware of it , till she heard the answer ; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced ?

Captain Wentworth	patient	induced	He had intended , on first arriving , to proceed very soon into Shropshire , and visit the brother settled in that country , but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	think	Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies . It was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way . Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins , and a very amiable , pleasing young man , between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth 's introduction . He was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father 's house , only two miles from Uppercross . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	seeing	A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period , and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners , and of seeing Captain Wentworth .

Captain Wentworth	patient	studying	Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross ; a most decided change . He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner ; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books before him , Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right , and talked , with grave faces , of his studying himself to death . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	seeing	It was Mary 's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from Henrietta , and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to - morrow . Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was wise . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	visited	One morning , about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth being gone a - shooting together , as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion - house . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	drew	The brow of the hill , where they remained , was a cheerful spot : Louisa returned ; and Mary , finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile , was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her ; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away , to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge - row , and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound , Mary was happy no longer 
Captain Wentworth	patient	heard	Anne , really tired herself , was glad to sit down ; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge - row , behind her , as if making their way back along the rough , wild sort of channel , down the centre . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	leaving	This was against her ; but on the other hand , he spent so much of his time at Uppercross , that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind , than as going towards him ; and , upon the whole , she believed she must , on this interesting question , be the gainer , almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society , in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell 
Captain Wentworth	patient	seeing	She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall : those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her ; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere .

Captain Wentworth	patient	found	A letter from his friend , Captain Harville , having found him out at last , had brought intelligence of Captain Harville 's being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter ; of their being therefore , quite unknowingly , within twenty miles of each other . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	drove	The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this Mr Musgrove , for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning . They were , consequently , to stay the night there , and not to be expected back till the next day 's dinner . This was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages , Mr Musgrove 's coach containing the four ladies , and Charles 's curricle , in which he drove Captain Wentworth , were descending the long hill into Lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone . After securing accommodations , and ordering a dinner at one of the inns , the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea .

Captain Wentworth	patient	see	He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week , and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him ; but , as Charles maintained to the last , Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch . There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick , from this time . Lady Russell could not hear the door - bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father 's grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him .

It did not surprise , but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	saw	She saw that he saw Elizabeth , that Elizabeth saw him , that there was complete internal recognition on each side ; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance , expecting it , and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness .

The interruption had been short , though severe , and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out , but not to Anne . She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed , and of the manner in which it had been received ; a manner of doubtful meaning , of surprise rather than gratification , of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance . She knew him ; she saw disdain in his eye , and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering , as an atonement for all the insolence of the past . Her spirits sank . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	reckoning	They were reckoning him as certain , but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	supposed	She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation , to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath , for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself , she determined to mention it , and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs Clay 's face as she listened . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	forgotten	she would not have forgotten him so soon ! 
Captain Wentworth	patient	forget	We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	forced	You are forced on exertion . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	take	You have always a profession , pursuits , business of some sort or other , to take you back into the world immediately , and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	bless	"She had the kindest "" Good morning , God bless you ! "" from Captain Harville , but from him not a word , nor a look ! "
Captain Wentworth	patient	meeting	To lose the possibility of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet , solitary progress up the town ( and she felt almost certain of meeting him ) could not be borne . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	assure	I am afraid there had been some mistake ; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth , that we hope to see them both . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	asking	Because , if you are , I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place , and give Anne your arm to her father 's door . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	place	Captain Wentworth , with five - and - twenty thousand pounds , and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him , was no longer nobody . He was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish , spendthrift baronet , who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which Providence had placed him , and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter .

Captain Wentworth	patient	saw	Sir Walter , indeed , though he had no affection for Anne , and no vanity flattered , to make him really happy on the occasion , was very far from thinking it a bad match for her . On the contrary , when he saw more of Captain Wentworth , saw him repeatedly by daylight , and eyed him well , he was very much struck by his personal claims , and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank ; and all this , assisted by his well - sounding name , enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen , with a very good grace , for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour .

Captain Wentworth	patient	keep	Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her , no landed estate , no headship of a family ; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet , she would not change situations with Anne . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	love	Anne , satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell 's meaning to love Captain Wentworth as she ought , had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	estimate	The disproportion in their fortune was nothing ; it did not give her a moment 's regret ; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly , nothing of respectability , of harmony , of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters , was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	attach	To those , however , he was very well disposed to attach himself . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	obliged	Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for Mrs Smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	known	A very few days more , and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch , and Mr Musgrove had called on him , and come back warm in his praise , and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross , by the end of another week . It had been a great disappointment to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed , so impatient was he to shew his gratitude , by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own roof , and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars . But a week must pass ; only a week , in Anne 's reckoning , and then , she supposed , they must meet ; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week .

Captain Wentworth	patient	found	She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House , where , as she afterwards learnt , they must inevitably have found him , when they were stopped by the eldest boy 's being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall . The child 's situation put the visit entirely aside ; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference , even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	thought	Till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar - bone was soon replaced , and though Mr Robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew 's state , as to give the information of Captain Wentworth 's visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	invite	How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner , how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power , and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma 's farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow -- actually on the morrow ; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner , as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought . And in short , he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace , that they could assure them all , their heads were both turned by him ; and off they ran , quite as full of glee as of love , and apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles . 
Captain Wentworth	patient	putting	The same story and the same raptures were repeated , when the two girls came with their father , through the gloom of the evening , to make enquiries ; and Mr Musgrove , no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir , could add his confirmation and praise , and hope there would be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off , and only be sorry to think 
Captain Wentworth	patient	meet	His father very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth , and there being no sufficient reason against it , he ought to go ; and it ended in his making a bold , public declaration , when he came in from shooting , of his meaning to dress directly , and dine at the other house . 
William Elliot	agent	came	He was invited to Kellynch Hall ; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year ; but he never came . 
William Elliot	agent	come	The following spring he was seen again in town , found equally agreeable , again encouraged , invited , and expected , and again he did not come ; and the next tidings were that he was married . Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot , he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth .

William Elliot	agent	attempted	Mr Elliot had attempted no apology , and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family , as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it : all acquaintance between them had ceased .

William Elliot	agent	conducted	Yet so miserably had he conducted himself , that though she was at this present time ( the summer of 1814 ) wearing black ribbons for his wife , she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again . 
William Elliot	agent	done	The disgrace of his first marriage might , perhaps , as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring , have been got over , had he not done worse ; but he had , as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends , they had been informed , spoken most disrespectfully of them all , most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to , and the honours which were hereafter to be his own . This could not be pardoned .

William Elliot	agent	goes	Depend upon it , that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish , wherever he goes . 
William Elliot	agent	had	Do you think he had the Elliot countenance ? 
William Elliot	agent	had	I hardly looked at him , I was looking at the horses ; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance , I wonder the arms did not strike me ! 
William Elliot	agent	called	He had called in Camden Place ; had called a second time , a third ; had been pointedly attentive . 
William Elliot	agent	taken	If Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves , had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance , and proclaim the value of the connection , as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect . 
William Elliot	agent	sought	If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch , he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree . Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance , but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not , which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath . 
William Elliot	agent	passed	He had been in Bath about a fortnight ; ( he had passed through Bath in November , in his way to London , when the intelligence of Sir Walter 's being settled there had of course reached him , though only twenty - four hours in the place , but he had not been able to avail himself of it ;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath , and his first object on arriving , had been to leave his card in Camden Place , following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet , and when they did meet , by such great openness of conduct , such readiness to apologize for the past , such solicitude to be received as a relation again , that their former good understanding was completely re - established . 
William Elliot	agent	explained	He had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side . 
William Elliot	agent	had	He had never had an idea of throwing himself off ; he had feared that he was thrown off , but knew not why , and delicacy had kept him silent .

William Elliot	agent	taking	He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him ; and certainly , the pains he had been taking on this , the first opportunity of reconciliation , to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir - presumptive , was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject . 
William Elliot	agent	entered	The circumstances of his marriage , too , were found to admit of much extenuation . This was an article not to be entered on by himself ; but a very intimate friend of his , a Colonel Wallis , a highly respectable man , perfectly the gentleman , ( and not an ill - looking man , Sir Walter added ) , who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings , and had , at his own particular request , been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot , had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage , which made a material difference in the discredit of it . Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long , had been well acquainted also with his wife , had perfectly understood the whole story . 
William Elliot	agent	called	Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology ; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light , she allowed it be a great extenuation . Mr Elliot had called repeatedly , had dined with them once , evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked , for they gave no dinners in general ; delighted , in short , by every proof of cousinly notice , and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place . 
William Elliot	agent	wishing	All that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators . Still , however , she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared , in Mr Elliot 's wishing , after an interval of so many years , to be well received by them . 
William Elliot	agent	had	In a worldly view , he had nothing to gain by being on terms with Sir Walter ; nothing to risk by a state of variance . 
William Elliot	agent	looked	A sensible man , and he had looked like a very sensible man , why should it be an object to him ? She could only offer one solution ; it was , perhaps , for Elizabeth 's sake . 
William Elliot	agent	afford	There might really have been a liking formerly , though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way ; and now that he could afford to please himself , he might mean to pay his addresses to her . Elizabeth was certainly very handsome , with well - bred , elegant manners , and her character might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot , knowing her but in public , and when very young himself .

William Elliot	agent	seemed	However it might end , he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in Bath : she saw nobody equal to him ; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme , which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again , and to see more of , as herself . 
William Elliot	agent	gave	He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness . She knew it well ; and she remembered another person 's look also .

William Elliot	agent	enter	It was not merely complaisance , it must be a liking to the cause , which made him enter warmly into her father and sister 's solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them . 
William Elliot	agent	agreed	"when Anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to Mr Elliot , he agreed to their being nothing in themselves , but still maintained that , as a family connexion , as good company , as those who would collect good company around them , they had their value . Anne smiled and said , "" My idea of good company , Mr Elliot , is the company of clever , well - informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what I call good company . "" "" You are mistaken , "" said he gently , "" that is not good company ; that is the best . Good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice . Birth and good manners are essential ; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company ; on the contrary , it will do very well . My cousin Anne shakes her head . She is not satisfied . "

William Elliot	agent	say	You may depend upon it , that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter , and as rank is rank , your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family ( our family let me say ) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for . 
William Elliot	agent	made	She had been the only one of the set absent , for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship 's service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot ; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early , and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her . Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell .

Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell . 
William Elliot	agent	thought	Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot . He thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence . He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits ; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend , could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man , without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create . Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot .

William Elliot	agent	speaking	The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself brought Anne to composure again . 
William Elliot	agent	talked	That he was a sensible man , an agreeable man , that he talked well , professed good opinions , seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle , this was all clear enough .

William Elliot	agent	think	She saw that there had been bad habits ; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing ; that there had been a period of his life ( and probably not a short one ) when he had been , at least , careless in all serious matters ; and , though he might now think very differently , who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever , cautious man , grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ? How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ? Mr Elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open . There was never any burst of feeling , any warmth of indignation or delight , at the evil or good of others . This , to Anne , was a decided imperfection . 
William Elliot	agent	pleased	Various as were the tempers in her father 's house , he pleased them all . 
William Elliot	agent	endured	He endured too well , stood too well with every body . 
William Elliot	agent	spoken	He had spoken to her with some degree of openness of Mrs Clay ; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was about , and to hold her in contempt ; and yet Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body . Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend , for she saw nothing to excite distrust . She could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot ; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church , in the course of the following autumn .

William Elliot	agent	attending	Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay . 
William Elliot	agent	stepped	It began to rain , not much , but enough to make shelter desirable for women , and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple 's carriage , which was seen waiting at a little distance ; she , Anne , and Mrs Clay , therefore , turned into Molland 's , while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple , to request her assistance . 
William Elliot	agent	joined	He soon joined them again , successful , of course ; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home , and would call for them in a few minutes . Her ladyship 's carriage was a barouche , and did not hold more than four with any comfort . Miss Carteret was with her mother ; consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden Place ladies . There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot . Whoever suffered inconvenience , she must suffer none , but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two . 
William Elliot	agent	deciding	much thicker than Miss Anne 's ; and , in short , her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be , and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined , that the others were obliged to settle it for them ; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already , and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal , 
William Elliot	agent	setting	For a few minutes she saw nothing before her ; it was all confusion . She was lost , and when she had scolded back her senses , she found the others still waiting for the carriage , and Mr Elliot ( always obliging ) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs Clay 's . She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door ; she wanted to see if it rained . 
William Elliot	agent	walked	She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in . 
William Elliot	agent	dislike	""" Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin , I fancy ? "
William Elliot	agent	escorted	""" Lady Dalrymple , Lady Dalrymple , "" was the rejoicing sound ; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance , Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her . Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , escorted by Mr Elliot and Colonel Wallis , who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant , advanced into the room . The others joined them , and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included . She was divided from Captain Wentworth . "
William Elliot	agent	manoeuvred	The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches : Anne was among those on the foremost , and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well , with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis , as to have a seat by her . Miss Elliot , surrounded by her cousins , and the principal object of Colonel Wallis 's gallantry , was quite contented .

William Elliot	agent	marrying	` Why , to be sure , ma'am , ' said she , ` it would not prevent his marrying anybody else . 
William Elliot	agent	led	Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion . She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot 's marriage ) they had been as before always together , and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune . 
William Elliot	agent	led	Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself , and was most tender of throwing any on her husband ; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living , and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance . From his wife 's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings , easy temper , careless habits , and not strong understanding , much more amiable than his friend , and very unlike him , led by him , and probably despised by him .

He had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after Lady Elliot 's death , Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing - back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to London , when Elizabeth was in her first bloom , Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction .

William Elliot	patient	seen	Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of Mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , Charles taking care of his sister , and Captain Benwick attending to her . She gave a moment 's recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . There she had listened to Henrietta 's schemes for Dr Shirley 's leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen Mr Elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa , or those who were wrapt up in her welfare . Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance .

William Elliot	patient	knew	He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him ; and certainly , the pains he had been taking on this , the first opportunity of reconciliation , to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir - presumptive , was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject . 
William Elliot	patient	known	The circumstances of his marriage , too , were found to admit of much extenuation . This was an article not to be entered on by himself ; but a very intimate friend of his , a Colonel Wallis , a highly respectable man , perfectly the gentleman , ( and not an ill - looking man , Sir Walter added ) , who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings , and had , at his own particular request , been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot , had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage , which made a material difference in the discredit of it . Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long , had been well acquainted also with his wife , had perfectly understood the whole story . 
William Elliot	patient	sought	There had been the charm . She had sought him . 
William Elliot	patient	tempted	Without that attraction , not all her money would have tempted Elliot , and Sir Walter was , moreover , assured of her having been a very fine woman . Here was a great deal to soften the business . 
William Elliot	patient	drawn	There might really have been a liking formerly , though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way ; and now that he could afford to please himself , he might mean to pay his addresses to her . Elizabeth was certainly very handsome , with well - bred , elegant manners , and her character might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot , knowing her but in public , and when very young himself .

Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter ; "" Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter "" ( there was no occasion for remembering Mary ) ; and Anne , smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was . "
William Elliot	patient	introduce	He had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs ; had heard voices , mirth continually ; thought they must be a most delightful set of people , longed to be with them , but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself . 
William Elliot	patient	cure	""" Well , it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn , which he had adopted , when quite a young man , on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious . "
William Elliot	patient	diffused	"The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view . "" But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone : he knew it ; he was soon diffused again among the others , and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme . "
William Elliot	patient	compare	She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell , in the wish of really comprehending what had passed , and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it . 
William Elliot	patient	known	"As Mr Elliot became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others . His manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told Anne , almost ready to exclaim , "" Can this be Mr Elliot ? "" and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man . "
William Elliot	patient	recommend	It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently ; and it did not surprise her , therefore , that Lady Russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent , nothing to require more motives than appeared , in Mr Elliot 's great desire of a reconciliation . In Lady Russell 's view , it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot , at a mature time of life , should feel it a most desirable object , and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people , to be on good terms with the head of his family ; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear , and only erring in the heyday of youth . 
William Elliot	patient	inviting	She had been the only one of the set absent , for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship 's service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot ; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early , and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her . Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell . 
William Elliot	patient	delighted	Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot . He thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence . He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits ; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend , could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man , without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create . Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot . 
William Elliot	patient	free	She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her , and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood , and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing . 
William Elliot	patient	leave	She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her , and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood , and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing . 
William Elliot	patient	accept	I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together . 
William Elliot	patient	accept	She never could accept him .

William Elliot	patient	questioned	She wondered , and questioned him eagerly ; but in vain . 
William Elliot	patient	inspired	He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her . 
William Elliot	patient	invited	Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again , and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret , in a manner not to be refused , to sit between them ; and by some other removals , and a little scheming of her own , Anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before , much more within reach of a passer - by . 
William Elliot	patient	avoid	Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith , meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call ; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object . 
William Elliot	patient	acquainted	"She caught it instantaneously ; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety , soon added , more composedly , "" Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot ? "" "
William Elliot	patient	influence	""" I should be extremely happy ; I hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you , "" replied Anne ; "" but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case .

William Elliot	patient	led	He will not be led astray ; he will not be misled by others to his ruin . 
William Elliot	patient	consider	I consider him with great respect . 
William Elliot	patient	known	But I have not known him long ; and he is not a man , I think , to be known intimately soon . 
William Elliot	patient	accept	Should he ever propose to me ( which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing ) , I shall not accept him . 
William Elliot	patient	marry	Mrs Smith would hardly have believed so soon in Mr Elliot 's failure , but from the perception of there being a somebody else . As it was , she instantly submitted , and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond ; and Anne , eager to escape farther notice , was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot ; where she could have received the idea , or from whom she could have heard it . 
William Elliot	patient	marry	"I observed no one in particular . "" "" It was my friend Mrs Rooke ; Nurse Rooke ; who , by - the - bye , had a great curiosity to see you , and was delighted to be in the way to let you in . She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday ; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot . She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself , which did not seem bad authority . "

William Elliot	patient	knew	""" Yes ; he was not married when I knew him first . "
William Elliot	patient	seen	""" "" I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years , "" was Mrs Smith 's answer , given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther ; and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity . "
William Elliot	patient	giving	"At last-- "" I beg your pardon , my dear Miss Elliot , "" she cried , in her natural tone of cordiality , "" I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you , but I have been uncertain what I ought to do . "
William Elliot	patient	tell	I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you . 
William Elliot	patient	accepting	Though I fully believe that , at present , you have not the smallest intention of accepting him , there is no saying what may happen . 
William Elliot	patient	startle	"Anne 's astonished air , and exclamation of wonder , made her pause , and in a calmer manner , she added , "" My expressions startle you . "

William Elliot	patient	tell	I will only tell you what I have found him . 
William Elliot	patient	found	I will only tell you what I have found him . 
William Elliot	patient	loved	He was the intimate friend of my dear husband , who trusted and loved him , and thought him as good as himself . 
William Elliot	patient	known	It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister . I never knew him myself ; I only heard of him ; but there was a something in his conduct then , with regard to my father and sister , and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage , which I never could quite reconcile with present times .

William Elliot	patient	invited	I know he was invited and encouraged , and I know he did not choose to go . 
William Elliot	patient	used	I found he had been used to hear of me . 
William Elliot	patient	committed	All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune , before he committed himself . 
William Elliot	patient	have	I have often heard him declare , that if baronetcies were saleable , anybody should have his for fifty pounds , arms and motto , name and livery included ; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject . 
William Elliot	patient	lost	"The box was brought and placed before her , and Mrs Smith , sighing over it as she unlocked it , said-- "" This is full of papers belonging to him , to my husband ; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him . "
William Elliot	patient	shew	I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago , and I will shew him as he is now . 
William Elliot	patient	threw	Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re - admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ) , to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject . 
William Elliot	patient	guide	Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous , artificial , worldly man , who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness . 
William Elliot	patient	done	But Mr Elliot was not done with . 
William Elliot	patient	involving	Mr Elliot , raised by his marriage to great affluence , and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself , ( for with all his self - indulgence he had become a prudent man ) , and beginning to be rich , just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor , seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend 's probable finances , but , on the contrary , had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin ; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined . 
William Elliot	patient	tried	They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends , and to prove that Mr Elliot 's had better not be tried ; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known . 
William Elliot	patient	appointed	With a confidence in Mr Elliot 's regard , more creditable to his feelings than his judgement , Mr Smith had appointed him the executor of his will ; but Mr Elliot would not act , and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her , in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation , had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit , or listened to without corresponding indignation . 
William Elliot	patient	praise	""" She had seemed to recommend and praise him ! "" "
William Elliot	patient	marrying	I considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and I could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband . 
William Elliot	patient	seeing	She found , on reaching home , that she had , as she intended , escaped seeing Mr Elliot ; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit ; but hardly had she congratulated herself , and felt safe , when she heard that he was coming again in the evening . 
William Elliot	patient	asking	""" I had not the smallest intention of asking him , "" said Elizabeth , with affected carelessness , "" but he gave so many hints ; so Mrs Clay says , at least . "" "" Indeed , I do say it . "
William Elliot	patient	bring	However , when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning , I gave way immediately , for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together . 
William Elliot	patient	invite	I did invite him , you know . 
William Elliot	patient	sent	I sent him away with smiles . 
William Elliot	patient	gone	She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath the next morning , going early , and that he would be gone the greater part of two days . 
William Elliot	patient	invited	He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of his return ; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain . 
William Elliot	patient	expected	Anne , remembering the preconcerted visits , at all hours , of Mr Elliot , would have expected him , but for his known engagement seven miles off . 
William Elliot	patient	meet	She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot , and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , who were fortunately already engaged to come ; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention . 
William Elliot	patient	know	Not know Mr Elliot , indeed ! 
William Elliot	patient	prevented	He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return . 
William Elliot	patient	admitted	He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to - morrow . 
William Elliot	patient	seeing	He was full of ` to - morrow , ' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have 
William Elliot	patient	pity	Mr Elliot was there ; she avoided , but she could pity him . 
William Elliot	patient	relinquishing	Anne knew that Lady Russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot , and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with , and do justice to Captain Wentworth . 
William Elliot	patient	presented	She had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw , and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him . 
William Elliot	patient	save	He soon quitted Bath ; and on Mrs Clay 's quitting it soon afterwards , and being next heard of as established under his protection in London , it was evident how double a game he had been playing , and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman , at least . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	go	He would go , though I told him how ill I was . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	said	He said he should not stay out long ; but he has never come back , and now it is almost one .

One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one 's own . Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me , and we were so crowded ! They are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward . "
Charles Musgrove	agent	did	Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth , nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort . She was always on friendly terms with her brother - in - law ; and in the children , who loved her nearly as well , and respected her a great deal more than their mother , she had an object of interest , amusement , and wholesome exertion . Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits . As it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else .

Charles Musgrove	agent	told	"Jemima is so careful ; and she could send us word every hour how he was . I really think Charles might as well have told his father we would all come . I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is . I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday , but the case is very different to - day . "" "" Well , if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself , suppose you were to go , as well as your husband . Leave little Charles to my care . "
Charles Musgrove	agent	think	"Mr and Mrs Musgrove can not think it wrong while I remain with him . "" "" Are you serious ? "" cried Mary , her eyes brightening . "
Charles Musgrove	agent	minds	You can make little Charles do anything ; he always minds you at a word . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	came	The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child 's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice . Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over .

Charles Musgrove	agent	shewed	"Charles shewed himself at the window , all was ready , their visitor had bowed and was gone , the Miss Musgroves were gone too , suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen : the room was cleared , and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could .

Charles Musgrove	agent	told	"The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot , deprived his manners of their usual composure : he started , and could only say , "" I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here : Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here , "" before he walked to the window to recollect himself , and feel how he ought to behave . "" They are up stairs with my sister : they will be down in a few moments , I dare say , "" had been Anne 's reply , in all the confusion that was natural ; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him , she would have been out of the room the next moment , and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself . "
Charles Musgrove	agent	found	Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross ; a most decided change . He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner ; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books before him , Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right , and talked , with grave faces , of his studying himself to death . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	said	"Well now , I think we had better turn back ; I am excessively tired . "" Henrietta , conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as Mary wished ; but "" No ! "" said Charles Musgrove , and "" No , no ! "" cried Louisa more eagerly , and taking her sister aside , seemed to be arguing the matter warmly . "
Charles Musgrove	agent	consent	The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this Mr Musgrove , for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning . They were , consequently , to stay the night there , and not to be expected back till the next day 's dinner . This was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages , Mr Musgrove 's coach containing the four ladies , and Charles 's curricle , in which he drove Captain Wentworth , were descending the long hill into Lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone . After securing accommodations , and ordering a dinner at one of the inns , the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea .

Charles Musgrove	agent	jump	The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own ; the servant in mourning roused Anne 's curiosity , and the whole six were collected to look , by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household , and taking his seat , to drive off . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	cried	""" Anne , Anne , "" cried Charles , "" What is to be done next ? "
Charles Musgrove	agent	attending	To some of the best - looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned , for , though partially revived , she was quite helpless ; and in this manner , Anne walking by her side , and Charles attending to his wife , they set forward , treading back with feelings unutterable , the ground , which so lately , so very lately , and so light of heart , they had passed along . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	go	"Musgrove , either you or I must go . "" "
Charles Musgrove	agent	agreed	Charles agreed , but declared his resolution of not going away . He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	declared	Charles agreed , but declared his resolution of not going away . He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	agreed	Though it was rather desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay ; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take them back , would be a dreadful extension of suspense ; and Captain Wentworth proposed , and Charles Musgrove agreed , that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn , and leave Mr Musgrove 's carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early , when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa 's night . Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part , and to be soon followed by the two ladies . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	taking	Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of Mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , Charles taking care of his sister , and Captain Benwick attending to her . She gave a moment 's recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . There she had listened to Henrietta 's schemes for Dr Shirley 's leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen Mr Elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa , or those who were wrapt up in her welfare . Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good - will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	came	Charles came a few hours afterwards , to bring a later and more particular account . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	seemed	"In speaking of the Harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of Mrs Harville 's exertions as a nurse . "" She really left nothing for Mary to do . "

Charles Musgrove	agent	hoped	When he came away , she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	wished	He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	conveyed	A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne , and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery - maid of the family , one who having brought up all the children , and seen the very last , the lingering and long - petted Master Harry , sent to school after his brothers , was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her , and who , consequently , was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa . Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither , had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta ; but without Anne , it would hardly have been resolved on , and found practicable so soon . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	made	Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them . On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others . Charles and Mary also came in , of course , during their visit , and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell , and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain .

Charles Musgrove	agent	leaving	It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on Charles 's leaving them together , was listening to Mrs Musgrove 's history of Louisa , and to Henrietta 's of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which Mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill - used by anybody ; which Mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	came	A large party in an hotel ensured a quick - changing , unsettled scene . One five minutes brought a note , the next a parcel ; and Anne had not been there half an hour , when their dining - room , spacious as it was , seemed more than half filled : a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove , and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth .

Charles Musgrove	agent	returned	Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies . It was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way . Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins , and a very amiable , pleasing young man , between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth 's introduction . He was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father 's house , only two miles from Uppercross .

Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin 's behaviour . She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause .

Charles Musgrove	agent	remained	Everything was safe enough , and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject . Chapter 14 Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge . They had left Louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them . They had been all in lodgings together . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	laughed	Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme . She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight . Anne enquired after Captain Benwick , Mary 's face was clouded directly . Charles laughed .

Charles Musgrove	agent	maintained	He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week , and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him ; but , as Charles maintained to the last , Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch . There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick , from this time . Lady Russell could not hear the door - bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father 's grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him . Captain Benwick came not , however . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	imagined	He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined , or he was too shy ; and after giving him a week 's indulgence , Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite . The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school , bringing with them Mrs Harville 's little children , to improve the noise of Uppercross , and lessen that of Lyme . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	came	Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them . On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others . Charles and Mary also came in , of course , during their visit , and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell , and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain . 
Charles Musgrove	agent	heard	Charles heard it quite by chance ; they have not had the civility to give me any notice , or of offering to take anything . I do not think they improve at all as neighbours . We see nothing of them , and this is really an instance of gross inattention .

Charles Musgrove	patient	improved	Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth , nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort . She was always on friendly terms with her brother - in - law ; and in the children , who loved her nearly as well , and respected her a great deal more than their mother , she had an object of interest , amusement , and wholesome exertion . Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits . As it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	persuade	I am sure , Anne , if you would , you might persuade him that I really am very ill -- a great deal worse than I ever own . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	Bless	Bless me ! 
Charles Musgrove	patient	talked	"She should put it off as long as she could ; "" but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on an early day , and was in a very animated , comfortable state of imaginary agitation , when she came back . "
Charles Musgrove	patient	affected	In each letter he had spoken well of his captain ; but yet , so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters , so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships , that it had made scarcely any impression at the time ; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck , this very day , with a recollection of the name of Wentworth , as connected with her son , seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur . She had gone to her letters , and found it all as she supposed ; and the re - perusal of these letters , after so long an interval , her poor son gone for ever , and all the strength of his faults forgotten , had affected her spirits exceedingly , and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death . Mr Musgrove was , in a lesser degree , affected likewise ; and when they reached the cottage , they were evidently in want , first , of being listened to anew on this subject , and afterwards , of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them . To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth , repeating his name so often , puzzling over past years , and at last ascertaining that it might , that it probably would , turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting , once or twice , after their coming back from Clifton -- a very fine young man -- but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago , was a new sort of trial to Anne 's nerves . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	opposed	"Charles Musgrove , indeed , afterwards , shewed more of inclination ; "" the child was going on so well , and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth , that , perhaps , he might join them in the evening ; he would not dine from home , but he might walk in for half an hour . "" But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife , with "" Oh ! "
Charles Musgrove	patient	shut	This was quite a female case , and it would be highly absurd in him , who could be of no use at home , to shut himself up . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	leave	You would not like to leave him yourself , but you see I can be of no use . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	teaze	"Anne will send for me if anything is the matter . "" Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain . Mary knew , from Charles 's manner of speaking , that he was quite determined on going , and that it would be of no use to teaze him . "
Charles Musgrove	patient	enjoy	So here he is to go away and enjoy himself , and because I am the poor mother , I am not to be allowed to stir ; and yet , I am sure , I am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	told	I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother , but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick - room than Charles , for I can not be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if I told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	Leave	"Jemima is so careful ; and she could send us word every hour how he was . I really think Charles might as well have told his father we would all come . I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is . I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday , but the case is very different to - day . "" "" Well , if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself , suppose you were to go , as well as your husband . Leave little Charles to my care . "
Charles Musgrove	patient	leaving	It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima . Oh ! 
Charles Musgrove	patient	tell	I will go and tell Charles , and get ready directly . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	shewed	"Charles shewed himself at the window , all was ready , their visitor had bowed and was gone , the Miss Musgroves were gone too , suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen : the room was cleared , and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could . "" It is over ! "

Charles Musgrove	patient	visited	One morning , about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth being gone a - shooting together , as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion - house . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	disengaging	""" Captain Benwick obeyed , and Charles at the same moment , disengaging himself from his wife , they were both with him ; and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them , and everything was done that Anne had prompted , but in vain ; "
Charles Musgrove	patient	animate	Anne , attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to Henrietta , still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet Mary , to animate Charles , to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	listened	Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them , and a chaise and four in waiting , stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street ; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other , the change in his countenance , the astonishment , the expressions begun and suppressed , with which Charles was listened to , made but a mortifying reception of Anne ; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	persuaded	He and Mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night . Mary had been hysterical again this morning . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	surrounding	Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them . On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others .

Charles Musgrove	patient	ushered	"After the usual period of suspense , the usual sounds of approach were heard , and "" Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove "" were ushered into the room . Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance ; but Anne was really glad to see them ; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome ; and as soon as it became clear that these , their nearest relations , were not arrived with an views of accommodation in that house , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality , and do the honours of it very well . "
Charles Musgrove	patient	found	They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within , and by themselves , and Anne had the kindest welcome from each . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	hastened	Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings ; she had derived from it a delightful conviction ; but she feared from his looks , that the same unfortunate persuasion , which had hastened him away from the Concert Room , still governed . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	assured	"The chair was earnestly protested against , and Mrs Musgrove , who thought only of one sort of illness , having assured herself with some anxiety , that there had been no fall in the case ; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down , and got a blow on her head ; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall ; could part with her cheerfully , and depend on finding her better at night . Anxious to omit no possible precaution , Anne struggled , and said-- "" I am afraid , ma'am , that it is not perfectly understood . Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening . "
Charles Musgrove	patient	preventing	Charles , in his real concern and good nature , would go home with her ; there was no preventing him . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	mistaken	She had not mistaken him . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	influenced	Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment . That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four - and - twenty hours . It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks , or words , or actions occasionally encouraged ; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville ; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper , and poured out his feelings .

Charles Musgrove	patient	roused	The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused him , and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville 's had fixed her superiority . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	attach	In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove ( the attempts of angry pride ) , he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible ; that he had not cared , could not care , for Louisa ; though till that day , till the leisure for reflection which followed it , he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa 's could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . There , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self - will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	kept	There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost ; and there begun to deplore the pride , the folly , the madness of resentment , which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way . 
Charles Musgrove	patient	feel	He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa 's accident , no sooner begun to feel himself alive again , than he had begun to feel himself , though alive , not at liberty .

Charles Musgrove	patient	mortify	With regard to Charles Hayter , she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well - meaning young woman , and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned ; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings , the alternation could not be understood too soon . Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin 's behaviour . She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause .

Chapter 14 Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge . They had left Louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them .

Mary Musgrove	agent	came	Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them . On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others . Charles and Mary also came in , of course , during their visit , and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell , and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain .

Mary Musgrove	agent	dropped	They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove , and were at the White Hart . So much was pretty soon understood ; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing - room , and regaling themselves with her admiration , Anne could not draw upon Charles 's brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary , as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of .

Mary Musgrove	agent	required	It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on Charles 's leaving them together , was listening to Mrs Musgrove 's history of Louisa , and to Henrietta 's of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which Mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill - used by anybody ; which Mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining .

Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits .

Mrs Croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person . She had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather - beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight - and - thirty . Her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour .

Mary Musgrove	patient	alarm	You can send for us , you know , at a moment 's notice , if anything is the matter ; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	shut	If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child , I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	visit	The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth ; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child , and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though Charles had answered for the child 's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient , Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice . Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	avoid	Was this like wishing to avoid her ? And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	hating	Was this like wishing to avoid her ? And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	spared	"On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented , she was soon spared all suspense ; for , after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary : -- "" Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you , Anne , though he was so attentive to me . "
Mary Musgrove	patient	Dear	""" Dear me ! If he should rise to any very great honours ! If he should ever be made a baronet ! "
Mary Musgrove	patient	suited	It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very account of Charles Hayter , whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to . She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters , and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed -- very sad for herself and her children . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	grant	The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres , besides the farm near Taunton , which is some of the best land in the country . I grant you , that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta , and indeed it could not be ; he is the only one that could be possible ; but he is a very good - natured , good sort of a fellow ; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands , he will make a different sort of place of it , and live in a very different sort of way ; and with that property , he will never be a contemptible man -- good , freehold property . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	dissuade	She tried to dissuade Mary from going , but in vain ; and that being the case , thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves ' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise , as she might be useful in turning back with her sister , and lessening the interference in any plan of their own . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	Bless	"Mary exclaimed , "" Bless me ! "
Mary Musgrove	patient	assure	"Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to Henrietta , Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to Captain Wentworth-- "" It is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life . "" She received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of . "
Mary Musgrove	patient	prevent	; she quarrelled with her own seat , was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere , and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also . She turned through the same gate , but could not see them .

Mary Musgrove	patient	married	""" I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary . "
Mary Musgrove	patient	shewn	Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him , and was now to reap the consequence , which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch ; and when Mary began to complain of it , and lament her being ill - used , according to custom , in being on the hedge side , while Anne was never incommoded on the other , he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of , and they could hardly get him along at all . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	offended	The invitation was general , and generally declined . The Miss Musgroves were not at all tired , and Mary was either offended , by not being asked before any of the others , or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	leaving	This was against her ; but on the other hand , he spent so much of his time at Uppercross , that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind , than as going towards him ; and , upon the whole , she believed she must , on this interesting question , be the gainer , almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society , in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell 
Mary Musgrove	patient	Bless	"Many had looked on each other , and many had repeated the name , before all this had been got through , even by the smart rapidity of a waiter . "" Bless me !

Mary Musgrove	patient	strike	I hardly looked at him , I was looking at the horses ; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance , I wonder the arms did not strike me ! 
Mary Musgrove	patient	convince	When she could command Mary 's attention , Anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not , for many years , been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	quiet	Anne , attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to Henrietta , still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet Mary , to animate Charles , to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	convince	Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them , and a chaise and four in waiting , stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street ; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other , the change in his countenance , the astonishment , the expressions begun and suppressed , with which Charles was listened to , made but a mortifying reception of Anne ; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa .

Mary Musgrove	patient	persuaded	He and Mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night . Mary had been hysterical again this morning . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	admires	"I declare , Anne , he never talks of you at all . "" "" No , "" admitted Charles , "" I do not know that he ever does , in a general way ; but however , it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly . "

Mary Musgrove	patient	stopped	"His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family , has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me . "" This decision checked Mary 's eagerness , and stopped her short in the midst of the Elliot countenance . "
Mary Musgrove	patient	saw	""" The last time I saw her she had a red nose , but I hope that may not happen every day . "
Mary Musgrove	patient	tempt	""" If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , I would send her a new hat and pelisse . "" Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown , or a cap , would not be liable to any such misuse , when a knock at the door suspended everything . "
Mary Musgrove	patient	remembering	"Anne drew a little back , while the others received his compliments , and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour , but "" he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before , "" & c. & c ; which was all as politely done , and as politely taken , as possible , but her part must follow then . Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter ; "" Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter "" ( there was no occasion for remembering Mary ) ; and Anne , smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was .

Mary Musgrove	patient	seen	I need not ask after her . She never misses , I know ; and you must have seen her . She must have been in your own circle ; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple , you were in the seats of grandeur , round the orchestra , of course . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	walking	They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove , and were at the White Hart . So much was pretty soon understood ; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing - room , and regaling themselves with her admiration , Anne could not draw upon Charles 's brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary , as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	included	His mother had some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see ; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding - clothes for herself and her sister ; and , in short , it ended in being his mother 's party , that everything might be comfortable and easy to Captain Harville ; and he and Mary were included in it by way of general convenience . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	asked	She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot , and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , who were fortunately already engaged to come ; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention . 
Mary Musgrove	patient	convince	It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on Charles 's leaving them together , was listening to Mrs Musgrove 's history of Louisa , and to Henrietta 's of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which Mary required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill - used by anybody ; which Mary , well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining .

Mary Musgrove	patient	supposed	"He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to - morrow . "" As she spoke , she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her , the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her , and made her regret that she had said so much , simple as it was . Mary , resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin , began talking very warmly about the family features , and protesting still more positively that it was Mr Elliot , calling again upon Anne to come and look for herself , but Anne did not mean to stir , and tried to be cool and unconcerned . "
Mary Musgrove	patient	pacify	""" To pacify Mary , and perhaps screen her own embarrassment , Anne did move quietly to the window . "
Mary Musgrove	patient	flatter	It was creditable to have a sister married , and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion , by keeping Anne with her in the autumn ; and as her own sister must be better than her husband 's sisters , it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter .

Sir Walter Elliot	agent	continuing	That Lady Russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again , than when she does not ; but Sir Walter 's continuing in singleness requires explanation . 
Sir Walter Elliot	agent	met	Be it known then , that Sir Walter , like a good father , ( having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications ) , prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters ' sake . 
Sir Walter Elliot	agent	given	For one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do .

Sir Walter Elliot	agent	see	It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty - nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost . It was so with Elizabeth , still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and Sir Walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing .

Sir Walter Elliot	agent	asked	Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him , that Admiral Croft was a very hale , hearty , well - looking man , a little weather - beaten , to be sure , but not much , and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour ; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms , only wanted a comfortable home , and to get into it as soon as possible ; knew he must pay for his convenience ; knew what rent a ready - furnished house of that consequence might fetch ; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more ; had inquired about the manor ; would be glad of the deputation , certainly , but made no great point of it ; said he sometimes took out a gun , but never killed ; quite the gentleman .

Sir Walter Elliot	agent	gave	Sir Walter , on being applied to , without actually withholding his consent , or saying it should never be , gave it all the negative of great astonishment , great coldness , great silence , and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter . 
Sir Walter Elliot	agent	thought	He thought it a very degrading alliance ; and Lady Russell , though with more tempered and pardonable pride , received it as a most unfortunate one . Anne Elliot , with all her claims of birth , beauty , and mind , to throw herself away at nineteen ; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man , who had nothing but himself to recommend him , and no hopes of attaining affluence , but in the chances of a most uncertain profession , and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession , would be , indeed , a throwing away , which she grieved to think of !

Sir Walter Elliot	agent	reached	He had been in Bath about a fortnight ; ( he had passed through Bath in November , in his way to London , when the intelligence of Sir Walter 's being settled there had of course reached him , though only twenty - four hours in the place , but he had not been able to avail himself of it ;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath , and his first object on arriving , had been to leave his card in Camden Place , following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet , and when they did meet , by such great openness of conduct , such readiness to apologize for the past , such solicitude to be received as a relation again , that their former good understanding was completely re - established . 
Sir Walter Elliot	agent	added	The circumstances of his marriage , too , were found to admit of much extenuation . This was an article not to be entered on by himself ; but a very intimate friend of his , a Colonel Wallis , a highly respectable man , perfectly the gentleman , ( and not an ill - looking man , Sir Walter added ) , who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings , and had , at his own particular request , been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot , had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage , which made a material difference in the discredit of it . Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long , had been well acquainted also with his wife , had perfectly understood the whole story . 
Sir Walter Elliot	agent	seemed	Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology ; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light , she allowed it be a great extenuation .

The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him . "" "
Sir Walter Elliot	agent	does	If he does , however , they will leave me in peace , which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	prided	Be it known then , that Sir Walter , like a good father , ( having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications ) , prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters ' sake . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	tempted	For one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do . Elizabeth had succeeded , at sixteen , to all that was possible , of her mother 's rights and consequence ; and being very handsome , and very like himself , her influence had always been great , and they had gone on together most happily . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	trusted	Sir Walter had at first thought more of London ; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	dissuade	Sir Walter had at first thought more of London ; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	induced	Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from Kellynch , only fifty miles , and Lady Russell 's spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell , whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	solicited	Sir Walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner ; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention ; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant , on his own terms , and as a great favour , that he would let it at all . How quick come the reasons for approving what we like ! 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	induced	""" "" As to all that , "" rejoined Sir Walter coolly , "" supposing I were induced to let my house , I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it . I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant . "
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	disposed	""" "" As to all that , "" rejoined Sir Walter coolly , "" supposing I were induced to let my house , I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it . I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant . "
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	assure	Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him , that Admiral Croft was a very hale , hearty , well - looking man , a little weather - beaten , to be sure , but not much , and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour ; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms , only wanted a comfortable home , and to get into it as soon as possible ; knew he must pay for his convenience ; knew what rent a ready - furnished house of that consequence might fetch ; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more ; had inquired about the manor ; would be glad of the deputation , certainly , but made no great point of it ; said he sometimes took out a gun , but never killed ; quite the gentleman . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	talked	"One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common . "" As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter 's estimate of the dues of a tenant . It succeeded , however ; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house , and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms , he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty , and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft , who still remained at Taunton , and fix a day for the house being seen . "
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	influence	Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement , and saw nothing , therefore , but good manners in the other ; and with regard to the gentlemen , there was such an hearty good humour , such an open , trusting liberality on the Admiral 's side , as could not but influence Sir Walter , who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd 's assurances of his being known , by report , to the Admiral , as a model of good breeding .

Sir Walter Elliot	patient	draw	The last office of the four carriage - horses was to draw Sir Walter , Miss Elliot , and Mrs Clay to Bath . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	gone	"She had never been staying there before , without being struck by it , or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown , or unconsidered there , were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest ; yet , with all this experience , she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson , in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle , was become necessary for her ; for certainly , coming as she did , with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks , she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove : "" So , Miss Anne , Sir Walter and your sister are gone ; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in ? "" and this , without much waiting for an answer ; or in the young ladies ' addition of , "" I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter ; but remember , papa , if we do go , we must be in a good situation : none of your Queen Squares for us ! "" or in the anxious supplement from Mary , of-- "" Upon my word , I shall be pretty well off , when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath ! "
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	bid	"I am very angry with you . "" "" Walter , "" cried Charles Hayter , "" why do you not do as you are bid ? "
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	taking	In another moment , however , she found herself in the state of being released from him ; some one was taking him from her , though he had bent down her head so much , that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck , and he was resolutely borne away , before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it .

Sir Walter Elliot	patient	thank	Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless . She could not even thank him . She could only hang over little Charles , with most disordered feelings . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	minded	"She had a strong impression of his having said , in a vext tone of voice , after Captain Wentworth 's interference , "" You ought to have minded me , Walter ; I told you not to teaze your aunt ; "" and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself .

Sir Walter Elliot	patient	tell	You will tell Sir Walter what we have done , and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had . Indeed , I must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better . My wife should have the credit of them , however . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	settled	Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place , a lofty dignified situation , such as becomes a man of consequence ; and both he and Elizabeth were settled there , much to their satisfaction . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	leave	"Anne entered it with a sinking heart , anticipating an imprisonment of many months , and anxiously saying to herself , "" Oh ! when shall I leave you again ? "" "
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	refer	He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him ; and certainly , the pains he had been taking on this , the first opportunity of reconciliation , to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir - presumptive , was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	embarrassed	"Mr Elliot appeared to think that he ( Sir Walter ) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted ; "" but Sir Walter had "" not been able to return the compliment entirely , which had embarrassed him . "
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	allowed	He was not allowed to escape , however . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	told	There are several odd - looking men walking about here , who , I am told , are sailors . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	ordered	He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout , and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares with him in everything , and to walk for her life to do him good . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	watch	Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re - admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ) , to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	bring	However , when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning , I gave way immediately , for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together . 
Sir Walter Elliot	patient	struck	Sir Walter , indeed , though he had no affection for Anne , and no vanity flattered , to make him really happy on the occasion , was very far from thinking it a bad match for her . On the contrary , when he saw more of Captain Wentworth , saw him repeatedly by daylight , and eyed him well , he was very much struck by his personal claims , and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank ; and all this , assisted by his well - sounding name , enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen , with a very good grace , for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour .

Sir Walter Elliot	patient	wheedled	She has abilities , however , as well as affections ; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning , or hers , may finally carry the day ; whether , after preventing her from being the wife of Sir Walter , he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William . It can not be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion , and the discovery of their deception in her . They had their great cousins , to be sure , to resort to for comfort ; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others , without being flattered and followed in turn , is but a state of half enjoyment .

Mrs. Smith	agent	think	And , indeed , to own the truth , I do not think nurse , in her heart , is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter 's making a second match .

Mrs. Smith	agent	spoken	She had previously , in the anticipation of their marriage , been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it ; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature , since he did not even know her to be in Bath , it immediately occurred , that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved , and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne 's feelings , as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot 's character would allow , when Anne 's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything ; and while it took from her the new - formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety , left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way .

Mrs. Smith	patient	carried	Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion . She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot 's marriage ) they had been as before always together , and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune .

Lady Russell	agent	wanted	She wanted more vigorous measures , a more complete reformation , a quicker release from debt , a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity . 
Lady Russell	agent	said	""" If we can persuade your father to all this , "" said Lady Russell , looking over her paper , "" much may be done . "
Lady Russell	agent	hope	If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth , that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which can not be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle . 
Lady Russell	agent	have	"What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ? There will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct . I have great hope of prevailing . We must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man . "" This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him . She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure , and saw no dignity in anything short of it . She wanted it to be prescribed , and felt as a duty . She rated Lady Russell 's influence highly ; and as to the severe degree of self - denial which her own conscience prompted , she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete , than to half a reformation .

Lady Russell	agent	had	Lady Russell 's had no success at all : could not be put up with , were not to be borne . 
Lady Russell	agent	spending	Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from Kellynch , only fifty miles , and Lady Russell 's spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell , whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there . 
Lady Russell	agent	obliged	Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne 's known wishes . 
Lady Russell	agent	considered	And with regard to Anne 's dislike of Bath , she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising , first , from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there , after her mother 's death ; and secondly , from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself . Lady Russell was fond of Bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend 's health , by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good .

Lady Russell	agent	grieved	He thought it a very degrading alliance ; and Lady Russell , though with more tempered and pardonable pride , received it as a most unfortunate one . Anne Elliot , with all her claims of birth , beauty , and mind , to throw herself away at nineteen ; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man , who had nothing but himself to recommend him , and no hopes of attaining affluence , but in the chances of a most uncertain profession , and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession , would be , indeed , a throwing away , which she grieved to think of ! 
Lady Russell	agent	saw	Such confidence , powerful in its own warmth , and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it , must have been enough for Anne ; but Lady Russell saw it very differently . 
Lady Russell	agent	saw	She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil .

Lady Russell	agent	took	This invitation of Mary 's removed all Lady Russell 's difficulties , and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her , and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge .

Lady Russell	agent	get	So , Lady Russell would not get out . 
Lady Russell	agent	doing	I wish she had accepted him . We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell 's doing , that she did not . 
Lady Russell	agent	meeting	She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall : those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her ; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere . 
Lady Russell	agent	lived	"She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business ; felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought ; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active , respectable young man , as a resident curate , and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate 's being married . "" I wish , "" said Henrietta , very well pleased with her companion , "" I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross , and were intimate with Dr Shirley . I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody ! "
Lady Russell	agent	reverted	Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father 's house in Camden Place , or her own sister 's intimacy with Mrs Clay . She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her .

Lady Russell	agent	tell	"The first three or four days passed most quietly , with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme , which found their way to Anne , she could not tell how , and brought a rather improving account of Louisa . At the end of that period , Lady Russell 's politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self - threatenings of the past became in a decided tone , "" I must call on Mrs Croft ; I really must call upon her soon . Anne , have you courage to go with me , and pay a visit in that house ? "
Lady Russell	agent	suffer	"She could have said more on the subject ; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts , and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants , felt the parish to be so sure of a good example , and the poor of the best attention and relief , that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal , she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay , and that Kellynch Hall had passed into better hands than its owners ' . These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain , and severe was its kind ; but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again , and returning through the well - known apartments . In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself , "" These rooms ought to belong only to us . Oh , how fallen in their destination ! How unworthily occupied ! "
Lady Russell	agent	removing	Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other : but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present ; for when it was returned , the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks , to visit their connexions in the north of the county , and probably might not be at home again before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath . So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall , or of seeing him in company with her friend .

Lady Russell	agent	determined	He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined , or he was too shy ; and after giving him a week 's indulgence , Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite .

Lady Russell	agent	guarding	Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them . On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others . Charles and Mary also came in , of course , during their visit , and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell , and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain .

Lady Russell	agent	feeling	No , these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures ; her spirits rose under their influence ; and like Mrs Musgrove , she was feeling , though not saying , that after being long in the country , nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness .

You are your mother 's self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued !

Lady Russell	agent	took	Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the Admiral 's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her . Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft 's arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend 's carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral .

Lady Russell	agent	perceive	No , it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite . She looked at her however , from time to time , anxiously ; and when the moment approached which must point him out , though not daring to look again ( for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen ) , she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell 's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him-- of her being , in short , intently observing him . 
Lady Russell	agent	drew	She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell 's mind , the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes , the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him , and in foreign climes and in active service too , without robbing him of one personal grace ! At last , Lady Russell drew back her head . 
Lady Russell	agent	overlooked	Elizabeth had turned from him , Lady Russell overlooked him ; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances ; she felt that she owed him attention . 
Lady Russell	agent	did	She remained in her seat , and so did Lady Russell ; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot ; and she did not mean , whatever she might feel on Lady Russell 's account , to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth , if he gave her the opportunity . 
Lady Russell	agent	persuaded	""" Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed . It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell ! "
Lady Russell	agent	feeling	She was concerned for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling ; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister , and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils , without knowing how to avert any one of them . She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him . 
Lady Russell	agent	lend	you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me , and pretend I have read it through . 
Lady Russell	agent	bores	Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications . 
Lady Russell	agent	had	I used to think she had some taste in dress , but I was ashamed of her at the concert . 
Lady Russell	agent	sits	"and she sits so upright ! My best love , of course . "" "" And mine , "" added Sir Walter . "
Lady Russell	agent	wear	Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card . Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life , who make themselves up so little . If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen ; but last time I called , I observed the blinds were let down immediately . 
Lady Russell	agent	had	This however was what Lady Russell had now to do . She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both ; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each ; that because Captain Wentworth 's manners had not suited her own ideas , she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity ; and that because Mr Elliot 's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness , their general politeness and suavity , she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well - regulated mind .

Lady Russell	agent	do	There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do , than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong , and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes . There is a quickness of perception in some , a nicety in the discernment of character , a natural penetration , in short , which no experience in others can equal , and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend . 
Lady Russell	agent	loved	But she was a very good woman , and if her second object was to be sensible and well - judging , her first was to see Anne happy . She loved Anne better than she loved her own abilities ; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over , found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child .

Lady Russell	agent	value	Lady Russell , in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for Mrs Smith , she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently . 
Lady Russell	patient	called	Their two confidential friends , Mr Shepherd , who lived in the neighbouring market town , and Lady Russell , were called to advise them ; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure , without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride . 
Lady Russell	patient	blinded	She had a cultivated mind , and was , generally speaking , rational and consistent ; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry ; she had a value for rank and consequence , which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them . Herself the widow of only a knight , she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due ; and Sir Walter , independent of his claims as an old acquaintance , an attentive neighbour , an obliging landlord , the husband of her very dear friend , the father of Anne and her sisters , was , as being Sir Walter , in her apprehension , entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties . They must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt . 
Lady Russell	patient	blame	But in this case , Anne had left nothing for advice to do ; and though Lady Russell , as satisfied as ever with her own discretion , never wished the past undone , she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne 's being tempted , by some man of talents and independence , to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits . They knew not each other 's opinion , either its constancy or its change , on the one leading point of Anne 's conduct , for the subject was never alluded to ; but Anne , at seven - and - twenty , thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen . She did not blame Lady Russell , she did not blame herself for having been guided by her ; but she felt that were any young person , in similar circumstances , to apply to her for counsel , they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness , such uncertain future good . 
Lady Russell	patient	startled	So far all was perfectly right ; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan , when it burst on her , which was , Mrs Clay 's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth , as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her . 
Lady Russell	patient	please	"They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell , and that therefore , she persuaded Anne to refuse him . "" The sounds were retreating , and Anne distinguished no more . "
Lady Russell	patient	join	: the day was even fixed ; and Anne , being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled , was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch , and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it . 
Lady Russell	patient	respect	"I am afraid of her , as I have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but I respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross . "" "
Lady Russell	patient	meet	Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father 's house in Camden Place , or her own sister 's intimacy with Mrs Clay . She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her . 
Lady Russell	patient	arrived	Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before , when a full account of the whole had burst on her ; but still it must be talked of , she must make enquiries , she must regret the imprudence , lament the result , and Captain Wentworth 's name must be mentioned by both . 
Lady Russell	patient	suit	"This is breaking a head and giving a plaster , truly ! "" Admiral Croft 's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell , but they delighted Anne . "
Lady Russell	patient	call	""" Upon my word , "" said she , "" I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture , steady and matter of fact as I may call myself . "
Lady Russell	patient	put	She was put down in Camden Place ; and Lady Russell then drove to her own lodgings , in Rivers Street . 
Lady Russell	patient	consulted	She only consulted Lady Russell , who entered thoroughly into her sentiments , and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith 's lodgings in Westgate Buildings , as Anne chose to be taken . The visit was paid , their acquaintance re - established , their interest in each other more than re - kindled . 
Lady Russell	patient	inviting	She had been the only one of the set absent , for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship 's service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot ; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early , and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her . Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell . 
Lady Russell	patient	meet	Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot . He thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence . He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits ; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend , could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man , without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create . Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot . 
Lady Russell	patient	heard	"Anne heard her , and made no violent exclamations ; she only smiled , blushed , and gently shook her head . "" I am no match - maker , as you well know , "" said Lady Russell , "" being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations . "
Lady Russell	patient	allowed	"Lady Russell let this pass , and only said in rejoinder , "" I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother 's place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me .

My dearest Anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! "" "
Lady Russell	patient	tell	How would it all be ? She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick . 
Lady Russell	patient	deceived	It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived ; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference , which carried them through the greater part of the morning , was , that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Smith , in which his conduct was involved . 
Lady Russell	patient	tell	She must talk to Lady Russell , tell her , consult with her , and having done her best , wait the event with as much composure as possible ; and after all , her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell ; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself . 
Lady Russell	patient	tell	You need not tell her so , but I thought her dress hideous the other night . 
Lady Russell	patient	influenced	This however was what Lady Russell had now to do . She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both ; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each ; that because Captain Wentworth 's manners had not suited her own ideas , she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity ; and that because Mr Elliot 's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness , their general politeness and suavity , she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well - regulated mind .

Louisa Musgrove	agent	remain	The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ) , had brought Anne the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more . He had enquired after her , she found , particularly ; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot 's not being the worse for her exertions , and had spoken of those exertions as great . This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done . As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove 's recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter !

Louisa Musgrove	agent	bear	In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove ( the attempts of angry pride ) , he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible ; that he had not cared , could not care , for Louisa ; though till that day , till the leisure for reflection which followed it , he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa 's could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . There , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self - will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind . 
Louisa Musgrove	agent	wished	I was hers in honour if she wished it . 
Louisa Musgrove	patient	come	"The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage ; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot , the coach was beginning to be listened for , when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in . That she was coming to apologize , and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves , was the first black idea ; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted , when Louisa made all right by saying , that she only came on foot , to leave more room for the harp , which was bringing in the carriage . "" And I will tell you our reason , "" she added , "" and all about it . I am come on to give you notice , that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening , especially mamma ; she is thinking so much of poor Richard ! "
Louisa Musgrove	patient	liking	And as to Captain Wentworth 's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta , it is nonsense to say so ; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best . 
Louisa Musgrove	patient	overturned	"You make the most of it , I know , "" cried Louisa , "" but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place . If I loved a man , as she loves the Admiral , I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else . "" It was spoken with enthusiasm . "" Had you ? "" cried he , catching the same tone ; "" I honour you ! "" "
Louisa Musgrove	patient	heard	Anne , really tired herself , was glad to sit down ; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge - row , behind her , as if making their way back along the rough , wild sort of channel , down the centre . 
Louisa Musgrove	patient	frightened	"What Anne first heard was-- "" And so , I made her go . I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . What ! "
Louisa Musgrove	patient	turned	would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do , and that I knew to be right , by the airs and interference of such a person , or of any person I may say ?

Louisa Musgrove	patient	protected	"While she remained , a bush of low rambling holly protected her , and they were moving on . Before they were beyond her hearing , however , Louisa spoke again .

Louisa Musgrove	patient	marked	The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand ; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman 's side , and a relenting on the lady 's , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt . Henrietta looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased;-- Charles Hayter exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross . Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two . 
Louisa Musgrove	patient	attending	After attending Louisa through her business , and loitering about a little longer , they returned to the inn ; and Anne , in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining - room , had nearly run against the very same gentleman , as he came out of an adjoining apartment . 
Louisa Musgrove	patient	jumped	and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight , excepting Louisa ; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth . 
Louisa Musgrove	patient	jump	In all their walks , he had had to jump her from the stiles ; the sensation was delightful to her .

Louisa Musgrove	patient	leaving	"They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more ; and yet perhaps , by "" putting the children away in the maid 's room , or swinging a cot somewhere , "" they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides , supposing they might wish to stay ; though , with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove , there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville 's care entirely . "
Louisa Musgrove	patient	nurse	A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne , and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery - maid of the family , one who having brought up all the children , and seen the very last , the lingering and long - petted Master Harry , sent to school after his brothers , was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her , and who , consequently , was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa . Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither , had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta ; but without Anne , it would hardly have been resolved on , and found practicable so soon . 
Louisa Musgrove	patient	moved	She had little difficulty ; it was soon determined that they would go ; go to - morrow , fix themselves at the inn , or get into lodgings , as it suited , and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved . 
Louisa Musgrove	patient	left	Everything was safe enough , and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject . Chapter 14 Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove 's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge . They had left Louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them . They had been all in lodgings together .

Louisa Musgrove	patient	suited	Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme . She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight . Anne enquired after Captain Benwick , Mary 's face was clouded directly . Charles laughed .

The high - spirited , joyous - talking Louisa Musgrove , and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading , Captain Benwick , seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other . 
Louisa Musgrove	patient	persuaded	She did not mean , however , to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity , than Mary might have allowed . She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment .

Louisa Musgrove	patient	bespoke	It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again , for that other Miss Musgrove , I find , is bespoke by her cousin , the young parson . 
Louisa Musgrove	patient	named	He looked very well , not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits , and he talked of Uppercross , of the Musgroves , nay , even of Louisa , and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her ; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable , not easy , not able to feign that he was . It did not surprise , but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him . 
Louisa Musgrove	patient	regard	I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable , sweet - tempered girl , and not deficient in understanding , but Benwick is something more . 
Louisa Musgrove	patient	love	He is a clever man , a reading man ; and I confess , that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise . Had it been the effect of gratitude , had he learnt to love her , because he believed her to be preferring him , it would have been another thing . But I have no reason to suppose it so .

Elizabeth Elliot	agent	succeeded	For one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do . Elizabeth had succeeded , at sixteen , to all that was possible , of her mother 's rights and consequence ; and being very handsome , and very like himself , her influence had always been great , and they had gone on together most happily . 
Elizabeth Elliot	agent	marry	All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably . 
Elizabeth Elliot	agent	begun	It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty - nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost . It was so with Elizabeth , still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and Sir Walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing .

Elizabeth Elliot	patient	disappointed	The heir presumptive , the very William Walter Elliot , Esq . , whose rights had been so generously supported by her father , had disappointed her . 
Elizabeth Elliot	patient	known	She had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should . He had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after Lady Elliot 's death , Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing - back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to London , when Elizabeth was in her first bloom , Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction . 
Elizabeth Elliot	patient	convince	If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth , that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which can not be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle . 
Elizabeth Elliot	patient	induced	Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from Kellynch , only fifty miles , and Lady Russell 's spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell , whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there .

She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : Elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility .

Elizabeth Elliot	patient	advising	However , at any rate , as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have , I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me . 
Elizabeth Elliot	patient	made	Elizabeth , though resenting the suspicion , might yet be made observant by it . 
Elizabeth Elliot	patient	settled	Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place , a lofty dignified situation , such as becomes a man of consequence ; and both he and Elizabeth were settled there , much to their satisfaction . 
Elizabeth Elliot	patient	knowing	There might really have been a liking formerly , though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way ; and now that he could afford to please himself , he might mean to pay his addresses to her .

Elizabeth Elliot	patient	provided	"It was all said very gracefully , and the cards with which she had provided herself , the "" Miss Elliot at home , "" were laid on the table , with a courteous , comprehensive smile to all , and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth . "
Elizabeth Elliot	patient	shocked	She has abilities , however , as well as affections ; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning , or hers , may finally carry the day ; whether , after preventing her from being the wife of Sir Walter , he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William . It can not be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion , and the discovery of their deception in her . They had their great cousins , to be sure , to resort to for comfort ; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others , without being flattered and followed in turn , is but a state of half enjoyment . 
Captain Benwick	agent	valued	Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia ; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him , on his return from Lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies . 
Captain Benwick	agent	living	Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville , or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change . He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily , uniting very strong feelings with quiet , serious , and retiring manners , and a decided taste for reading , and sedentary pursuits . To finish the interest of the story , the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed , if possible , augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance , and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely .

Captain Benwick	agent	came	He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week , and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him ; but , as Charles maintained to the last , Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch . There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick , from this time . Lady Russell could not hear the door - bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father 's grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him . Captain Benwick came not , however . 
Captain Benwick	agent	beginning	He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined , or he was too shy ; and after giving him a week 's indulgence , Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite . The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school , bringing with them Mrs Harville 's little children , to improve the noise of Uppercross , and lessen that of Lyme . 
Captain Benwick	agent	had	as well as the Harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa , and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by Captain Harville . True , upon my honour !

Captain Benwick	agent	seemed	She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly . Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove ! The high - spirited , joyous - talking Louisa Musgrove , and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading , Captain Benwick , seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other . 
Captain Benwick	agent	felt	That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary , from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself .

I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ? "" He answered rather hesitatingly , "" Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different .

Captain Benwick	agent	living	The peace turned him on shore at the very moment , and he has been living with us , in our little family circle , ever since . 
Captain Benwick	patient	stamped	Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia ; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him , on his return from Lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies . 
Captain Benwick	patient	shewing	He was shy , and disposed to abstraction ; but the engaging mildness of her countenance , and gentleness of her manners , soon had their effect ; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion . He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading , though principally in poetry ; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening 's indulgence in the discussion of subjects , which his usual companions had probably no concern in , she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction , which had naturally grown out of their conversation . For , though shy , he did not seem reserved ; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints ; and having talked of poetry , the richness of the present age , and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first - rate poets , trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred , and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos ; and moreover , how the Giaour was to be pronounced , he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet , and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other ; he repeated , with such tremulous feeling , the various lines which imaged a broken heart , or a mind destroyed by wretchedness , and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood , that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry , and to say , that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely ; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly . His looks shewing him not pained , but pleased with this allusion to his situation , she was emboldened to go on ; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind , she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study ; and on being requested to particularize , mentioned such works of our best moralists , such collections of the finest letters , such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering , as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts , and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances . Captain Benwick listened attentively , and seemed grateful for the interest implied ; and though with a shake of the head , and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his , noted down the names of those she recommended , and promised to procure and read them 
Captain Benwick	patient	seen	They were not off the Cobb , before the Harvilles met them . Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house , with a countenance which showed something to be wrong ; and they had set off immediately , informed and directed as they passed , towards the spot . 
Captain Benwick	patient	placed	He had handed them both in , and placed himself between them ; and in this manner , under these circumstances , full of astonishment and emotion to Anne , she quitted Lyme . 
Captain Benwick	patient	strike	Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now , to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character ; and whether it might not strike him that , like all other qualities of the mind , it should have its proportions and limits . She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character .

Admiral Croft	agent	sat	She wished , however to see the Crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned . They came : the master of the house was not at home , but the two sisters were together ; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne , while the Admiral sat by Mary , and made himself very agreeable by his good - humoured notice of her little boys , she was well able to watch for a likeness , and if it failed her in the features , to catch it in the voice , or in the turn of sentiment and expression . Mrs Croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person . She had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather - beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight - and - thirty . Her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour .

Admiral Croft	agent	encountered	Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see the Admiral 's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy , Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her . Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft 's arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend 's carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral .

Henrietta Musgrove	agent	took	She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday . 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	found	With regard to Charles Hayter , she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well - meaning young woman , and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned ; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings , the alternation could not be understood too soon . Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin 's behaviour . She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause . 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	had	Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted , and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them . 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	seemed	When I have made up my mind , I have made it ; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to - day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance ! 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	turned	""" She would have turned back then , but for you ? "" "" She would indeed . "
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	have	After the hints you gave just now , which did but confirm my own observations , the last time I was in company with him , I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on . I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this . Your sister is an amiable creature ; but yours is the character of decision and firmness , I see . 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	returned	Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give . Charles and Henrietta returned , bringing , as may be conjectured , Charles Hayter with them . 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	looked	The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand ; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman 's side , and a relenting on the lady 's , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt . Henrietta looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased;-- Charles Hayter exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross . Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two . 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	agreed	Chapter 12 Anne and Henrietta , finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning , agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast . 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	began	"They went to the sands , to watch the flowing of the tide , which a fine south - easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted . They praised the morning ; gloried in the sea ; sympathized in the delight of the fresh - feeling breeze -- and were silent ; till Henrietta suddenly began again with-- "" Oh ! yes,--I am quite convinced that , with very few exceptions , the sea - air always does good . "
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	help	Now , I can not help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea . 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	think	I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely , and fix at Lyme . Do not you , Anne ? Do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and Mrs Shirley ? 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	think	Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley , who have been doing good all their lives , wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross , where , excepting our family , they seem shut out from all the world . 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	wish	I wish his friends would propose it to him . 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	think	I really think they ought . 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	say	My only doubt is , whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish . He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions ; over - scrupulous I must say .

Henrietta Musgrove	agent	startled	Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne 's imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour ; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered , she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta , eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out , and calling on her companions to lose no time , lest somebody else should come in . 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	known	Anne talked of being perfectly ready , and tried to look it ; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair , in preparing to quit the room , she would have found , in all her own sensations for her cousin , in the very security of his affection , wherewith to pity her . Their preparations , however , were stopped short . 
Henrietta Musgrove	agent	gone	The party before her were , Mrs Musgrove , talking to Mrs Croft , and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth ; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta , too impatient to wait , had gone out the moment it had cleared , but would be back again soon , and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned . She had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed . There was no delay , no waste of time .

Henrietta Musgrove	patient	think	It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very account of Charles Hayter , whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to .

Henrietta Musgrove	patient	liking	And as to Captain Wentworth 's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta , it is nonsense to say so ; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best . 
Henrietta Musgrove	patient	prefer	As to Captain Wentworth 's views , she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister , or impeaching his own honour , than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa , or Louisa to Henrietta .

Mrs. Clay	agent	believed	From situation , Mrs Clay was , in Lady Russell 's estimate , a very unequal , and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion ; and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind , and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot 's reach , was therefore an object of first - rate importance . 
Mrs. Clay	agent	said	""" "" They would look around them , no doubt , and bless their good fortune , "" said Mrs Clay , for Mrs Clay was present : her father had driven her over , nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay 's health as a drive to Kellynch : "" but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant .

Mrs. Clay	agent	know	She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation , to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath , for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself , she determined to mention it , and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs Clay 's face as she listened . 
Mrs. Clay	agent	sacrificed	Mrs Clay 's affections had overpowered her interest , and she had sacrificed , for the young man 's sake , the possibility of scheming longer for Sir Walter .

It can not be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion , and the discovery of their deception in her . They had their great cousins , to be sure , to resort to for comfort ; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others , without being flattered and followed in turn , is but a state of half enjoyment .

Mrs. Clay	agent	help	Penelope , my dear , can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford : Mrs Croft 's brother ? 
Mrs. Clay	agent	mean	""" I have no conception whom you can mean , Shepherd ; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent . "" "" Bless me ! "
Mrs. Clay	agent	know	I did invite him , you know . 
Mrs. Clay	patient	leave	From situation , Mrs Clay was , in Lady Russell 's estimate , a very unequal , and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion ; and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind , and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot 's reach , was therefore an object of first - rate importance . 
Mrs. Clay	patient	driven	""" "" They would look around them , no doubt , and bless their good fortune , "" said Mrs Clay , for Mrs Clay was present : her father had driven her over , nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay 's health as a drive to Kellynch : "" but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant . "
Mrs. Clay	patient	Bless	""" I have no conception whom you can mean , Shepherd ; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent . "" "" Bless me ! "
Mrs. Clay	patient	acquainted	"A name that I am so very well acquainted with ; knew the gentleman so well by sight ; seen him a hundred times ; came to consult me once , I remember , about a trespass of one of his neighbours ; farmer 's man breaking into his orchard ; wall torn down ; apples stolen ; caught in the fact ; and afterwards , contrary to my judgement , submitted to an amicable compromise . Very odd indeed ! "" After waiting another moment-- "" You mean Mr Wentworth , I suppose ? "" said Anne . "

Very odd indeed ! "" After waiting another moment-- "" You mean Mr Wentworth , I suppose ? "" said Anne . "
Mrs. Clay	patient	engaged	So far all was perfectly right ; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan , when it burst on her , which was , Mrs Clay 's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth , as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her . 
Mrs. Clay	patient	assure	""" Mrs Clay , "" said she , warmly , "" never forgets who she is ; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , I can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people . "
Mrs. Clay	patient	grant	If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman , I grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , I am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy . 
Mrs. Clay	patient	have	If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman , I grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , I am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy . 
Mrs. Clay	patient	vexed	The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour , and of Anne so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in Bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed . 
Mrs. Clay	patient	liking	""" He looked , as he spoke , to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately occupying : a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant ; and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride , she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay ; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father 's getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her . "
Mrs. Clay	patient	attending	Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay . 
Mrs. Clay	patient	watch	Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re - admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ) , to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject . 
Mrs. Clay	patient	thinks	""" He thinks Mrs Clay afraid of him , aware that he sees through her , and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence . But since he must be absent some time or other , I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence . "
Mrs. Clay	patient	marry	Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea , as nurse tells me , that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry , that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay . 
Mrs. Clay	patient	devoting	It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight of Mr Elliot ; and yet she could assume a most obliging , placid look , and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done otherwise . 
Mrs. Clay	patient	saw	On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell , and accomplish the necessary communication ; and she would have gone directly after breakfast , but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble , which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion . She saw Mrs Clay fairly off , therefore , before she began to talk of spending the morning in Rivers Street . 
Mrs. Clay	patient	preventing	She has abilities , however , as well as affections ; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning , or hers , may finally carry the day ; whether , after preventing her from being the wife of Sir Walter , he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William . It can not be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion , and the discovery of their deception in her . They had their great cousins , to be sure , to resort to for comfort ; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others , without being flattered and followed in turn , is but a state of half enjoyment .

Captain Harville	agent	received	Captain Harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before , and Captain Wentworth 's anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme . 
Captain Harville	agent	visited	The varieties in the fitting - up of the rooms , where the common necessaries provided by the owner , in the common indifferent plight , were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood , excellently worked up , and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited , were more than amusing to Anne ; connected as it all was with his profession , the fruit of its labours , the effect of its influence on his habits , the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented , made it to her a something more , or less , than gratification . 
Captain Harville	agent	contrived	Captain Harville was no reader ; but he had contrived excellent accommodations , and fashioned very pretty shelves , for a tolerable collection of well - bound volumes , the property of Captain Benwick .

Captain Harville	agent	promised	The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow , but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening ; and he came , bringing his friend also , which was more than had been expected , it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers . He ventured among them again , however , though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general .

Captain Harville	agent	led	While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to Anne 's lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick ; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him .

Captain Harville	agent	give	"She was deep in the happiness of such misery , or the misery of such happiness , instantly . Two minutes after her entering the room , Captain Wentworth said-- "" We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials . "" Materials were at hand , on a separate table ; he went to it , and nearly turning his back to them all , was engrossed by writing .

Captain Harville	agent	seemed	"Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation , and yet , as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk , she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars ; such as , "" how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again "
Captain Harville	agent	inviting	She felt its application to herself , felt it in a nervous thrill all over her ; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table , Captain Wentworth 's pen ceased to move , his head was raised , pausing , listening , and he turned round the next instant to give a look , one quick , conscious look at her . The two ladies continued to talk , to re - urge the same admitted truths , and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation , but Anne heard nothing distinctly ; it was only a buzz of words in her ear , her mind was in confusion . Captain Harville , who had in truth been hearing none of it , now left his seat , and moved to a window , and Anne seeming to watch him , though it was from thorough absence of mind , became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood .

Captain Harville	patient	settled	A letter from his friend , Captain Harville , having found him out at last , had brought intelligence of Captain Harville 's being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter ; of their being therefore , quite unknowingly , within twenty miles of each other . 
Captain Harville	patient	see	Captain Harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before , and Captain Wentworth 's anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme . 
Captain Harville	patient	directing	Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year ; his taste , and his health , and his fortune , all directing him to a residence inexpensive , and by the sea ; and the grandeur of the country , and the retirement of Lyme in the winter , appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick 's state of mind . 
Captain Harville	patient	prevented	His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise ; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within . 
Captain Harville	patient	furnish	His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise ; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within . 
Captain Harville	patient	had	Their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again ; and they walked together some time , talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron , and still as unable as before , and as unable as any other two readers , to think exactly alike of the merits of either , till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party , and instead of Captain Benwick , she had Captain Harville by her side . 
Captain Harville	patient	obeyed	They would not listen to scruples : he was obeyed ; they were all beneath his roof ; and while Louisa , under Mrs Harville 's direction , was conveyed up stairs , and given possession of her own bed , assistance , cordials , restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them . Louisa had once opened her eyes , but soon closed them again , without apparent consciousness . 
Captain Harville	patient	included	His mother had some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see ; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding - clothes for herself and her sister ; and , in short , it ended in being his mother 's party , that everything might be comfortable and easy to Captain Harville ; and he and Mary were included in it by way of general convenience .

Mrs. Harville	agent	seemed	Mrs Harville , a degree less polished than her husband , seemed , however , to have the same good feelings ; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own , because the friends of Captain Wentworth , or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them . The dinner , already ordered at the inn , was at last , though unwillingly , accepted as a excuse ; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should have brought any such party to Lyme , without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them .

Mrs. Harville	agent	joined	Breakfast had not been long over , when they were joined by Captain and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick ; with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme . They ought to be setting off for Uppercross by one , and in the mean while were to be all together , and out of doors as long as they could . 
Mrs. Harville	agent	giving	"You may think , Miss Elliot , whether he is dear to us ! "" Anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different . Mrs Harville 's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home , determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk ; they would accompany them to their door , and then return and set off themselves . "
Mrs. Harville	agent	want	Between these two , she could want no possible attendance by day or night . 
Mrs. Harville	agent	left	"In speaking of the Harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of Mrs Harville 's exertions as a nurse . "" She really left nothing for Mary to do . "
Mrs. Harville	agent	going	When he came away , she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good . 
Mrs. Harville	agent	left	He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do . 
Mrs. Harville	agent	given	Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme . She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight . Anne enquired after Captain Benwick , Mary 's face was clouded directly . Charles laughed .

Mrs. Harville	agent	says	Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister 's account ; but , however , Louisa is a great favourite with both . 
Mrs. Harville	agent	agree	Indeed , Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her . 
Mrs. Harville	agent	seemed	He had begun to talk of it a week ago ; and by way of doing something , as shooting was over , Charles had proposed coming with him , and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it 
Mrs. Harville	agent	remained	Mrs Harville , her children , and Captain Benwick , remained with Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross . 
Mrs. Harville	patient	brought	""" You were living with your husband , and were the only woman on board . "" "" But you , yourself , brought Mrs Harville , her sister , her cousin , and three children , round from Portsmouth to Plymouth . "
Mrs. Harville	patient	taking	""" My feelings , you see , did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all her family to Plymouth . "
Mrs. Harville	patient	assist	But as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist Mrs Harville , I think it need be only one . 
Mrs. Harville	patient	relieve	They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that Anne was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence . She was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character . A few days had made a change indeed ! If Louisa recovered , it would all be well again .
