Character	Role	Event	Context
Fanny Price	agent	spoke	She was small of her age , with no glow of complexion , nor any other striking beauty ; exceedingly timid and shy , and shrinking from notice ; but her air , though awkward , was not vulgar , her voice was sweet , and when she spoke her countenance was pretty . 
Fanny Price	agent	needed	Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly ; and Sir Thomas , seeing how much she needed encouragement , tried to be all that was conciliating : but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of deportment ; and Lady Bertram , without taking half so much trouble , or speaking one word where he spoke ten , by the mere aid of a good - humoured smile , became immediately the less awful character of the two .

Fanny Price	agent	swallow	In vain were the well - meant condescensions of Sir Thomas , and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that she would be a good girl ; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug , and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart towards giving her comfort ; she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her , and sleep seeming to be her likeliest friend , she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed

Fanny Price	agent	understand	I do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her , for , with all its faults , it _ was _ her home , and she can not as yet understand how much she has changed for the better ; but then there is moderation in all things .

Fanny Price	agent	awed	She was disheartened by Lady Bertram ’s silence , awed by Sir Thomas ’s grave looks , and quite overcome by Mrs. Norris ’s admonitions . 
Fanny Price	agent	move	The rooms were too large for her to move in with ease : whatever she touched she expected to injure , and she crept about in constant terror of something or other ; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry ; and the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing - room when she left it at night as seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good fortune , ended every day ’s sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep .

Fanny Price	agent	quarrelled	or had she quarrelled with Maria and Julia ? 
Fanny Price	agent	remember	“ You are sorry to leave Mama , my dear little Fanny , ” said he , “ which shows you to be a very good girl ; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends , who all love you , and wish to make you happy . 
Fanny Price	agent	tell	Let us walk out in the park , and you shall tell me all about your brothers and sisters . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	repeated	Come with me into the breakfast - room , we shall find everything there , and be sure of having the room to ourselves . ” “ But , cousin , will it go to the post ? ” “ Yes , depend upon me it shall : it shall go with the other letters ; and , as your uncle will frank it , it will cost William nothing . ” “ My uncle ! ” repeated Fanny , with a frightened look . 
Fanny Price	agent	thought	Fanny thought it a bold measure , but offered no further resistance ; and they went together into the breakfast - room , where Edmund prepared her paper , and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brother could himself have felt , and probably with somewhat more exactness .

Fanny Price	agent	felt	He continued with her the whole time of her writing , to assist her with his penknife or his orthography , as either were wanted ; and added to these attentions , which she felt very much , a kindness to her brother which delighted her beyond all the rest . 
Fanny Price	agent	believed	Fanny ’s feelings on the occasion were such as she believed herself incapable of expressing ; but her countenance and a few artless words fully conveyed all their gratitude and delight , and her cousin began to find her an interesting object . 
Fanny Price	agent	said	He talked to her more , and , from all that she said , was convinced of her having an affectionate heart , and a strong desire of doing right ; and he could perceive her to be farther entitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation , and great timidity . 
Fanny Price	agent	having	He talked to her more , and , from all that she said , was convinced of her having an affectionate heart , and a strong desire of doing right ; and he could perceive her to be farther entitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation , and great timidity . 
Fanny Price	agent	required	He had never knowingly given her pain , but he now felt that she required more positive kindness ; and with that view endeavoured , in the first place , to lessen her fears of them all , and gave her especially a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria and Julia , and being as merry as possible . 
Fanny Price	agent	grew	From this day Fanny grew more comfortable . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	She felt that she had a friend , and the kindness of her cousin Edmund gave her better spirits with everybody else .

Fanny Price	agent	had	She felt that she had a friend , and the kindness of her cousin Edmund gave her better spirits with everybody else . 
Fanny Price	agent	began	The place became less strange , and the people less formidable ; and if there were some amongst them whom she could not cease to fear , she began at least to know their ways , and to catch the best manner of conforming to them . 
Fanny Price	agent	start	The little rusticities and awkwardnesses which had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all , and not least of herself , necessarily wore away , and she was no longer materially afraid to appear before her uncle , nor did her aunt Norris ’s voice make her start very much . 
Fanny Price	agent	became	To her cousins she became occasionally an acceptable companion . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	Edmund was uniformly kind himself ; and she had nothing worse to endure on the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of seventeen will always think fair with a child of ten . 
Fanny Price	agent	read	Fanny could read , work , and write , but she had been taught nothing more ; and as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with which they had been long familiar , they thought her prodigiously stupid , and for the first two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh report of it into the drawing - room .

Fanny Price	agent	says	Do you know , she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	say	As for Fanny ’s being stupid at learning , “ she could only say it was very unlucky , but some people _ were _ stupid , and Fanny must take more pains : she did not know what else was to be done ; and , except her being so dull , she must add she saw no harm in the poor little thing , and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages , and fetching what she wanted . ”

Fanny Price	agent	thought	There was no positive ill - nature in Maria or Julia ; and though Fanny was often mortified by their treatment of her , she thought too lowly of her own claims to feel injured by it . 
Fanny Price	agent	entering	From about the time of her entering the family , Lady Bertram , in consequence of a little ill - health , and a great deal of indolence , gave up the house in town , which she had been used to occupy every spring , and remained wholly in the country , leaving Sir Thomas to attend his duty in Parliament , with whatever increase or diminution of comfort might arise from her absence . 
Fanny Price	agent	saw	Of the rest she saw nothing : nobody seemed to think of her ever going amongst them again , even for a visit , nobody at home seemed to want her ; but William determining , soon after her removal , to be a sailor , was invited to spend a week with his sister in Northamptonshire before he went to sea . 
Fanny Price	agent	observed	In the fullness of his belief that such a thing must be , he mentioned its probability to his wife ; and the first time of the subject ’s occurring to her again happening to be when Fanny was present , she calmly observed to her , “ So , Fanny , you are going to leave us , and live with my sister . 
Fanny Price	agent	like	How shall you like it ? ” 
Fanny Price	agent	come	But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same . ” The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected .

Fanny Price	agent	hope	“ No , my dear ; I hope not . 
Fanny Price	agent	found	I have always found you a very good girl . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	left	Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart ; she could not feel the difference to be so small , she could not think of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction .

Fanny Price	agent	met	As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress . 
Fanny Price	agent	said	“ Cousin , ” said she , “ something is going to happen which I do not like at all ; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first , you will not be able to do it now .

Fanny Price	agent	hope	I hope it does not distress you very much , Fanny ? ”

Fanny Price	agent	think	But you are now of an age to be treated better ; I think she is behaving better already ; and when you are her only companion , you _ must _ be important to her . 
Fanny Price	agent	have	“ As to your foolishness and awkwardness , my dear Fanny , believe me , you never have a shadow of either , but in using the words so improperly . 
Fanny Price	agent	have	You have good sense , and a sweet temper , and I am sure you have a grateful heart , that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it .

Fanny Price	agent	said	“ You are too kind , ” said Fanny , colouring at such praise ; “ how shall I ever thank you as I ought , for thinking so well of me . 
Fanny Price	agent	remember	cousin , if I am to go away , I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life . ” “ Why , indeed , Fanny , I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the White House .

Fanny Price	agent	have	You will have the same walks to frequent , the same library to choose from , the same people to look at , the same horse to ride . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	remember	cousin , when I remember how much I used to dread riding , what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good ( oh ! how I have trembled at my uncle ’s opening his lips if horses were talked of ) , and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears , and convince me that I should like it after a little while , and feel how right you proved to be , I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well .

Fanny Price	agent	fixed	To prevent its being expected , she had fixed on the smallest habitation which could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish , the White House being only just large enough to receive herself and her servants , and allow a spare room for a friend , of which she made a very particular point .

Fanny Price	agent	goes	Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris — “ I think , sister , we need not keep Miss Lee any longer , when Fanny goes to live with you . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	live	Fanny live with me ! 
Fanny Price	agent	learnt	He could not but wonder at her refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt ; but , as she took early care to make him , as well as Lady Bertram , understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family , he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which , at the same time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them , would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself . Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal ; and her spontaneous , untaught felicity on the discovery , conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her . 
Fanny Price	agent	grieved	Fanny ’s relief , and her consciousness of it , were quite equal to her cousins ’ ; but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings were ungrateful , and she really grieved because she could not grieve .

Fanny Price	agent	see	Sir Thomas , who had done so much for her and her brothers , and who was gone perhaps never to return ! that she should see him go without a tear ! 
Fanny Price	agent	see	He had said to her , moreover , on the very last morning , that he hoped she might see William again in the course of the ensuing winter , and had charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to be in England . “ This was so thoughtful and kind ! ” and would he only have smiled upon her , and called her “ my dear Fanny , ” 
Fanny Price	agent	parted	But he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification , by adding , “ If William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	cried	She cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle was gone ; and her cousins , on seeing her with red eyes , set her down as a hypocrite . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season ; but she enjoyed being avowedly useful as her aunt ’s companion when they called away the rest of the family ; and , as Miss Lee had left Mansfield , she naturally became everything to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a party .

Fanny Price	agent	sat	They took their cheerful rides in the fine mornings of April and May ; and Fanny either sat at home the whole day with one aunt , or walked beyond her strength at the instigation of the other : Lady Bertram holding exercise to be as unnecessary for everybody as it was unpleasant to herself ; and Mrs. Norris , who was walking all day , thinking everybody ought to walk as much .

Fanny Price	agent	have	She could not but consider it as absolutely unnecessary , and even improper , that Fanny should have a regular lady ’s horse of her own , in the style of her cousins . 
Fanny Price	agent	have	“ Fanny must have a horse , ” was Edmund ’s only reply .

Fanny Price	agent	supposed	She had not supposed before that anything could ever suit her like the old grey pony ; but her delight in Edmund ’s mare was far beyond any former pleasure of the sort ; and the addition it was ever receiving in the consideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung , was beyond all her words to express . 
Fanny Price	agent	regarded	She regarded her cousin as an example of everything good and great , as possessing worth which no one but herself could ever appreciate , and as entitled to such gratitude from her as no feelings could be strong enough to pay . Her sentiments towards him were compounded of all that was respectful , grateful , confiding , and tender .

Three years ago the Admiral , my honoured uncle , bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in ; and my aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures ; but it being excessively pretty , it was soon found necessary to be improved , and for three months we were all dirt and confusion , without a gravel walk to step on , or a bench fit for use .

Fanny Price	agent	had	Fanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story , but his determined silence obliged her to relate her brother ’s situation : her voice was animated in speaking of his profession , and the foreign stations he had been on ; but she could not mention the number of years that he had been absent without tears in her eyes .

Fanny Price	agent	like	CHAPTER VII “ Well , Fanny , and how do you like Miss Crawford _ now _ ? 
Fanny Price	agent	said	“ Do not you think , ” said Fanny , after a little consideration , “ that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford , as her niece has been entirely brought up by her ? 
Fanny Price	agent	rate	She made me almost laugh ; but I can not rate so very highly the love or good - nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters , when they are separated . 
Fanny Price	agent	write	And what right had she to suppose that _ you _ would not write long letters when you were absent ? ” “ The right of a lively mind , Fanny , seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others ; perfectly allowable , when untinctured by ill - humour or roughness ; and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford : nothing sharp , or loud , or coarse . 
Fanny Price	agent	saw	I am glad you saw it all as I did . 
Fanny Price	agent	wonder	Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning ; she would gladly have been there too , might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed , to hear the harp ; neither could she wonder that , when the evening stroll was over , and the two families parted again , he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home , while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park ; but she thought it a very bad exchange ; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and water for her , would rather go without it than not .

Fanny Price	agent	scrupled	Edmund was fond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford , but he seemed to think it enough that the Admiral had since been spared ; and she scrupled to point out her own remarks to him , lest it should appear like ill - nature . 
Fanny Price	agent	rode	returned with it in excellent time , before either Fanny or the steady old coachman , who always attended her when she rode without her cousins , were ready to set forward . 
Fanny Price	agent	went	To avoid her aunt , and look for him , she went out . 
Fanny Price	agent	saw	The houses , though scarcely half a mile apart , were not within sight of each other ; but , by walking fifty yards from the hall door , she could look down the park , and command a view of the Parsonage and all its demesnes , gently rising beyond the village road ; and in Dr. Grant ’s meadow she immediately saw the group — Edmund and Miss Crawford both on horse - back , riding side by side , Dr. and Mrs. Grant , and Mr. Crawford , with two or three grooms , standing about and looking on . 
Fanny Price	agent	wondered	It was a sound which did not make _ her _ cheerful ; she wondered that Edmund should forget her , and felt a pang .

Fanny Price	agent	sat	At first Miss Crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field , which was not small , at a foot ’s pace ; then , at _ her _ apparent suggestion , they rose into a canter ; and to Fanny ’s timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well she sat . 
Fanny Price	agent	saw	Edmund was close to her ; he was speaking to her ; he was evidently directing her management of the bridle ; he had hold of her hand ; she saw it , or the imagination supplied what the eye could not reach .

Fanny Price	agent	began	She began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such double duty ; if she were forgotten , the poor mare should be remembered . 
Fanny Price	agent	stood	Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by seeing the party in the meadow disperse , and Miss Crawford still on horseback , but attended by Edmund on foot , pass through a gate into the lane , and so into the park , and make towards the spot where she stood . 
Fanny Price	agent	began	She began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient ; and walked to meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion .

Fanny Price	agent	looked	The old coachman , who had been waiting about with his own horse , now joining them , Fanny was lifted on hers , and they set off across another part of the park ; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing , as she looked back , that the others were walking down the hill together to the village ; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments on Miss Crawford ’s great cleverness as a horse - woman , which he had been watching with an interest almost equal to her own . 
Fanny Price	agent	meant	When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ride the next day . 
Fanny Price	agent	know	“ No , I do not know — not if you want the mare , ” was her answer .

Fanny Price	agent	had	As Mr. Rushworth did _ not _ come , the injury was increased , and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him ; she could only be sullen to her mother , aunt , and cousin , and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert .

Fanny Price	agent	forgot	“ No ; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry ; and , unluckily , Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key , so she was obliged to go again . 
Fanny Price	agent	stepping	And as for Fanny ’s just stepping down to my house for me — it is not much above a quarter of a mile — I can not think I was unreasonable to ask it .

Fanny Price	agent	had	He was ashamed to think that for four days together she had not had the power of riding , and very seriously resolved , however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of Miss Crawford ’s , that it should never happen again . 
Fanny Price	agent	went	Fanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of her arrival at the Park . 
Fanny Price	agent	feeling	The state of her spirits had probably had its share in her indisposition ; for she had been feeling neglected , and been struggling against discontent and envy for some days past . 
Fanny Price	agent	retreated	As she leant on the sofa , to which she had retreated that she might not be seen , the pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head ; and the sudden change which Edmund ’s kindness had then occasioned , made her hardly know how to support herself . 
Fanny Price	agent	have	it was a pity she should not see the place . ” “ You are very kind , you are all kindness , my dear madam , ” cried Mrs. Norris ; “ but as to Fanny , she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton .

Fanny Price	agent	feel	“ Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires , ” was Edmund ’s only reply , and the subject dropt . 
Fanny Price	agent	heard	Fanny ’s gratitude , when she heard the plan , was , in fact , much greater than her pleasure . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	She felt Edmund ’s kindness with all , and more than all , the sensibility which he , unsuspicious of her fond attachment , could be aware of ; but that he should forego any enjoyment on her account gave her pain , and her own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton would be nothing without him .

Fanny Price	agent	found	Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her best companions ; and , in observing the appearance of the country , the bearings of the roads , the difference of soil , the state of the harvest , the cottages , the cattle , the children , she found entertainment that could only have been heightened by having Edmund to speak to of what she felt .

Fanny Price	agent	had	Miss Crawford was not slow to admire ; she pretty well guessed Miss Bertram ’s feelings , and made it a point of honour to promote her enjoyment to the utmost . Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility ; and even Fanny had something to say in admiration , and might be heard with complacency . Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach ; and after being at some pains to get a view of the house , and observing that “ it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect , ” she added , “ Now , where is the avenue ?

Fanny Price	agent	pitied	Fanny pitied her . 
Fanny Price	agent	said	The _ manners _ I speak of might rather be called _ conduct _ , perhaps , the result of good principles ; the effect , in short , of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend ; and it will , I believe , be everywhere found , that as the clergy are , or are not what they ought to be , so are the rest of the nation . ” “ Certainly , ” said Fanny , with gentle earnestness .

Fanny Price	agent	said	It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world , and Miss Price has found it so , though she did not know it . ” “ I shall soon be rested , ” said Fanny ; “ to sit in the shade on a fine day , and look upon verdure , is the most perfect refreshment . ”

Fanny Price	agent	cried	“ Poor dear Fanny , ” cried her cousin , “ how ill you have been used by them !

Fanny Price	agent	resumed	Then seating herself with a gentleman on each side , she resumed the conversation which had engaged them before , and discussed the possibility of improvements with much animation .

Fanny Price	agent	cried	“ You will hurt yourself , Miss Bertram , ” she cried ; “ you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes ; you will tear your gown ; you will be in danger of slipping into the ha - ha . 
Fanny Price	agent	said	Her cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken , and , smiling with all the good - humour of success , she said , “ Thank you , my dear Fanny , but I and my gown are alive and well , and so good - bye . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	seen	Fanny was again left to her solitude , and with no increase of pleasant feelings , for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard , astonished at Miss Bertram , and angry with Mr. Crawford .

Fanny Price	agent	remained	By taking a circuitous , and , as it appeared to her , very unreasonable direction to the knoll , they were soon beyond her eye ; and for some minutes longer she remained without sight or sound of any companion . 
Fanny Price	agent	seemed	She seemed to have the little wood all to herself . 
Fanny Price	agent	thought	She could almost have thought that Edmund and Miss Crawford had left it , but that it was impossible for Edmund to forget her so entirely . 
Fanny Price	agent	expected	She expected Mr. Rushworth , but it was Julia , who , hot and out of breath , and with a look of disappointment , cried out on seeing her , “ Heyday ! 
Fanny Price	agent	explained	I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you . ” Fanny explained . 
Fanny Price	agent	allow	This was a most unjust reflection , but Fanny could allow for it , and let it pass : 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	Julia was vexed , and her temper was hasty ; but she felt that it would not last , and therefore , taking no notice , only asked her if she had not seen Mr. Rushworth .

Fanny Price	agent	felt	She felt that he had been very ill - used , and was quite unhappy in having to communicate what had passed . 
Fanny Price	agent	made	He joined her within five minutes after Julia ’s exit ; and though she made the best of the story , he was evidently mortified and displeased in no common degree . 
Fanny Price	agent	said	I have had walking enough . ” And he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny . “ I am very sorry , ” said she ; “ it is very unlucky . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	longed	And she longed to be able to say something more to the purpose . 
Fanny Price	agent	follow	“ Miss Bertram thought you would follow her . ” “ I should not have had to follow her if she had staid . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	know	A small sigh escaped Fanny here , and she did not know how to contradict him .

Fanny Price	agent	found	She found herself more successful in sending away than in retaining a companion . 
Fanny Price	agent	resolved	Fanny ’s thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her so long ago , and getting quite impatient , she resolved to go in search of them . 
Fanny Price	agent	followed	She followed their steps along the bottom walk , and had just turned up into another , when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford once more caught her ear ; the sound approached , and a few more windings brought them before her .

Fanny Price	agent	hoping	They were just returned into the wilderness from the park , to which a sidegate , not fastened , had tempted them very soon after their leaving her , and they had been across a portion of the park into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning to reach at last , and had been sitting down under one of the trees . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	Fanny ’s best consolation was in being assured that Edmund had wished for her very much , and that he should certainly have come back for her , had she not been tired already ; but this was not quite sufficient to do away with the pain of having been left a whole hour , when he had talked of only a few minutes , nor to banish the sort of curiosity she felt to know what they had been conversing about all that time ; and the result of the whole was to her disappointment and depression , as they prepared by general agreement to return to the house . 
Fanny Price	agent	found	Whatever cross - accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces , she had found a morning of complete enjoyment ; for the housekeeper , after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants , had taken her to the dairy , told her all about their cows , and given her the receipt for a famous cream cheese ; and since Julia ’s leaving them they had been met by the gardener , with whom she had made a most satisfactory acquaintance , for she had set him right as to his grandson ’s illness , convinced him that it was an ague , and promised him a charm for it ; and he , in return , had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants , and actually presented her with a very curious specimen of heath .

Fanny Price	agent	thought	Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more gay , and she thought that he was taking particular pains , during dinner , to do away any little resentment of the other two , and restore general good - humour . 
Fanny Price	agent	go	I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go .

Fanny Price	agent	carry	There , Fanny , you shall carry that parcel for me ; take great care of it : do not let it fall ; it is a cream cheese , just like the excellent one we had at dinner . 
Fanny Price	agent	cried	“ But _ that _ I am sure it has not , ” cried Fanny . 
Fanny Price	agent	said	” “ It is the same sort of thing , ” said Fanny , after a short pause , “ as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy , or the son of a general to be in the army , and nobody sees anything wrong in that . 
Fanny Price	agent	replied	“ No , ” replied Fanny , “ but we need not give up his profession for all that ; because , whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen , he would have taken a — not a good temper into it ; and as he must , either in the navy or army , have had a great many more people under his command than he has now , I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman .

Fanny Price	agent	suppose	Besides , I can not but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession , where he would have had less time and obligation — where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself , the _ frequency _ , at least , of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now . 
Fanny Price	agent	have	It must make him think ; and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	turned	Fanny turned farther into the window ; and Miss Crawford had only time to say , in a pleasant manner , “ I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it ” ; when , being earnestly invited by the Miss Bertrams to join in a glee , she tripped off to the instrument , leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many virtues , from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread .

Fanny Price	agent	see	Fanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike ; but since the day at Sotherton , she could never see Mr. Crawford with either sister without observation , and seldom without wonder or censure ; and had her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise of it in every other respect , had she been sure that she was seeing clearly , and judging candidly , she would probably have made some important communications to her usual confidant .

Fanny Price	agent	said	“ If Miss Bertram were not engaged , ” said Fanny cautiously , “ I could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	supposed	” Fanny supposed she must have been mistaken , and meant to think differently in future ; but with all that submission to Edmund could do , and all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she occasionally noticed in some of the others , and which seemed to say that Julia was Mr. Crawford ’s choice , she knew not always what to think .

Fanny Price	agent	listened	She was privy , one evening , to the hopes of her aunt Norris on the subject , as well as to her feelings , and the feelings of Mrs. Rushworth , on a point of some similarity , and could not help wondering as she listened ; and glad would she have been not to be obliged to listen , for it was while all the other young people were dancing , and she sitting , most unwillingly , among the chaperons at the fire , longing for the re - entrance of her elder cousin , on whom all her own hopes of a partner then depended .

Fanny Price	agent	thought	though feeling it would be a great honour to be asked by him , she thought it must happen .

Fanny Price	agent	believe	Tom , returning from them into the drawing - room , where Edmund was standing thoughtfully by the fire , while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at a little distance , and Fanny close beside her arranging her work , thus began as he entered—“Such a horribly vile billiard - table as ours is not to be met with , I believe , above ground .

Fanny Price	agent	cried	” “ You must excuse me , indeed you must excuse me , ” cried Fanny , growing more and more red from excessive agitation , and looking distressfully at Edmund , who was kindly observing her ; but unwilling to exasperate his brother by interference , gave her only an encouraging smile . 
Fanny Price	agent	like	You see she does not like to act . 
Fanny Price	agent	chuse	Let her chuse for herself , as well as the rest of us . 
Fanny Price	agent	do	“ I am not going to urge her , ” replied Mrs. Norris sharply ; “ but I shall think her a very obstinate , ungrateful girl , if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her — very ungrateful , indeed , considering who and what she is . 
Fanny Price	agent	like	Edmund was too angry to speak ; but Miss Crawford , looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris , and then at Fanny , whose tears were beginning to shew themselves , immediately said , with some keenness , “ I do not like my situation : this _ place _ is too hot for me , ” and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table , close to Fanny , saying to her , in a kind , low whisper , as she placed herself , “ Never mind , my dear Miss Price , this is a cross evening : everybody is cross and teasing , but do not let us mind them ” ; 
Fanny Price	agent	lost	By a look at her brother she prevented any farther entreaty from the theatrical board , and the really good feelings by which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to all the little she had lost in Edmund ’s favour .

Fanny Price	agent	went	When the evening was over , she went to bed full of it , her nerves still agitated by the shock of such an attack from her cousin Tom , so public and so persevered in , and her spirits sinking under her aunt ’s unkind reflection and reproach . 
Fanny Price	agent	do	To be called into notice in such a manner , to hear that it was but the prelude to something so infinitely worse , to be told that she must do what was so impossible as to act ; and then to have the charge of obstinacy and ingratitude follow it , enforced with such a hint at the dependence of her situation , had been too distressing at the time to make the remembrance when she was alone much less so , especially with the superadded dread of what the morrow might produce in continuation of the subject . 
Fanny Price	agent	do	Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time ; and if she were applied to again among themselves with all the authoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of , and Edmund perhaps away , what should she do ?

Fanny Price	agent	changed	what was yet more frequent or more dear , Edmund had been her champion and her friend : he had supported her cause or explained her meaning , he had told her not to cry , or had given her some proof of affection which made her tears delightful ; and the whole was now so blended together , so harmonised by distance , that every former affliction had its charm . The room was most dear to her , and she would not have changed its furniture for the handsomest in the house , though what had been originally plain had suffered all the ill - usage of children ; and its greatest elegancies and ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia ’s work , too ill done for the drawing - room , three transparencies , made in a rage for transparencies , for the three lower panes of one window , where Tintern Abbey held its station between a cave in Italy and a moonlight lake in Cumberland , a collection of family profiles , thought unworthy of being anywhere else , over the mantelpiece , and by their side , and pinned against the wall , a small sketch of a ship sent four years ago from the Mediterranean by William , with H.M.S. Antwerp at the bottom , in letters as tall as the mainmast . 
Fanny Price	agent	walked	To this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try its influence on an agitated , doubting spirit , to see if by looking at Edmund ’s profile she could catch any of his counsel , or by giving air to her geraniums she might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself .

Fanny Price	agent	accepted	Mrs. Grant was of consequence : _ her _ good - nature had honourable mention ; her taste and her time were considered ; her presence was wanted ; she was sought for , and attended , and praised ; and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her the character she had accepted .

Fanny Price	agent	found	Everything was now in a regular train : theatre , actors , actresses , and dresses , were all getting forward ; but though no other great impediments arose , Fanny found , before many days were past , that it was not all uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves , and that she had not to witness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had been almost too much for her at first . 
Fanny Price	agent	knew	_ She _ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant dreadfully ; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford ; that Tom Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible ; that Mrs. Grant spoiled everything by laughing ; that Edmund was behindhand with his part , and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth , who was wanting a prompter through every speech . 
Fanny Price	agent	knew	She knew , also , that poor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him : _ his _ complaint came before her as well as the rest ; and so decided to her eye was her cousin Maria ’s avoidance of him , and so needlessly often the rehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford , that she had soon all the terror of other complaints from _ him _ . 
Fanny Price	agent	found	So far from being all satisfied and all enjoying , she found everybody requiring something they had not , and giving occasion of discontent to the others . 
Fanny Price	agent	believed	Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the play as any of them ; Henry Crawford acted well , and it was a pleasure to _ her _ to creep into the theatre , and attend the rehearsal of the first act , in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for Maria .

Fanny Price	agent	judge	As far as she could judge , Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor of all : he had more confidence than Edmund , more judgment than Tom , more talent and taste than Mr. Yates . 
Fanny Price	agent	like	She did not like him as a man , but she must admit him to be the best actor , and on this point there were not many who differed from her .

Fanny Price	agent	think	Mr. Yates , indeed , exclaimed against his tameness and insipidity ; and the day came at last , when Mr. Rushworth turned to her with a black look , and said , “ Do you think there is anything so very fine in all this ? 
Fanny Price	agent	had	Fanny , in her pity and kindheartedness , was at great pains to teach him how to learn , giving him all the helps and directions in her power , trying to make an artificial memory for him , and learning every word of his part herself , but without his being much the forwarder . Many uncomfortable , anxious , apprehensive feelings she certainly had ; but with all these , and other claims on her time and attention , she was as far from finding herself without employment or utility amongst them , as without a companion in uneasiness ; quite as far from having no demand on her leisure as on her compassion . 
Fanny Price	agent	give	I have been slaving myself till I can hardly stand , to contrive Mr. Rushworth ’s cloak without sending for any more satin ; and now I think you may give me your help in putting it together . 
Fanny Price	agent	do	There are but three seams ; you may do them in a trice . 
Fanny Price	agent	took	_ You _ are best off , I can tell you : but if nobody did more than _ you _ , we should not get on very fast . ” Fanny took the work very quietly , without attempting any defence ; but her kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf — “ One can not wonder , sister , that Fanny _ should _ be delighted : it is all new to her , you know ; you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves , and so am I still ; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure , _ I _ mean to look in at their rehearsals too . 
Fanny Price	agent	believe	“ I believe , ” said Fanny to her aunt Bertram , “ there will be three acts rehearsed to - morrow evening , and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once . ”

Fanny Price	agent	share	Fanny did not share her aunt ’s composure : she thought of the morrow a great deal , for if the three acts were rehearsed , Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be acting together for the first time ; the third act would bring a scene between them which interested her most particularly , and which she was longing and dreading to see how they would perform .

Fanny Price	agent	attempt	She was invested , indeed , with the office of judge and critic , and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them all their faults ; but from doing so every feeling within her shrank — she could not , would not , dared not attempt it : had she been otherwise qualified for criticism , her conscience must have restrained her from venturing at disapprobation .

Fanny Price	agent	fainting	She was nearly fainting : all her former habitual dread of her uncle was returning , and with it compassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the development before him , with solicitude on Edmund ’s account indescribable . 
Fanny Price	agent	found	She had found a seat , where in excessive trembling she was enduring all these fearful thoughts , while the other three , no longer under any restraint , were giving vent to their feelings of vexation , lamenting over such an unlooked - for premature arrival as a most untoward event , and without mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been twice as long on his passage , or were still in Antigua . The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates , from better understanding the family , and judging more clearly of the mischief that must ensue .

Fanny Price	agent	did	Fanny ’s consequence increased on the departure of her cousins . Becoming , as she then did , the only young woman in the drawing - room , the only occupier of that interesting division of a family in which she had hitherto held so humble a third , it was impossible for her not to be more looked at , more thought of and attended to , than she had ever been before ; and “ Where is Fanny ? ” became no uncommon question , even without her being wanted for any one ’s convenience . Not only at home did her value increase , but at the Parsonage too .

Fanny Price	agent	feel	It was a fine arrangement for Henry Crawford , who was close to Fanny , and with his hands full of business , having two persons ’ cards to manage as well as his own ; for though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself mistress of the rules of the game in three minutes , he had yet to inspirit her play , sharpen her avarice , and harden her heart ,

Fanny Price	agent	dance	He remained steadily inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling ; to gratify anybody else who might wish to see Fanny dance , and to give pleasure to the young people in general ; and having thought the matter over , and taken his resolution in quiet independence , the result of it appeared the next morning at breakfast , when , after recalling and commending what his nephew had said , he added , “ I do not like , William , that you should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence .

Fanny Price	agent	left	The necklace really looked very well ; and Fanny left her room at last , comfortably satisfied with herself and all about her . 
Fanny Price	agent	sent	It had really occurred to her , unprompted , that Fanny , preparing for a ball , might be glad of better help than the upper housemaid ’s , and when dressed herself , she actually sent her own maid to assist her ; too late , of course , to be of any use . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	Mrs. Chapman had just reached the attic floor , when Miss Price came out of her room completely dressed , and only civilities were necessary ; but Fanny felt her aunt ’s attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman could do themselves . CHAPTER XXVIII

His coming might have nothing to do with her , but she must avoid seeing him if possible ; and being then on her way upstairs , she resolved there to remain , during the whole of his visit , unless actually sent for ; and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house , there seemed little danger of her being wanted .

Fanny Price	agent	sat	She sat some time in a good deal of agitation , listening , trembling , and fearing to be sent for every moment ; but as no footsteps approached the East room , she grew gradually composed , could sit down , and be able to employ herself , and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come and would go without her being obliged to know anything of the matter .

Fanny Price	agent	growing	Nearly half an hour had passed , and she was growing very comfortable , when suddenly the sound of a step in regular approach was heard ; 
Fanny Price	agent	knew	a heavy step , an unusual step in that part of the house : it was her uncle ’s ; she knew it as well as his voice ; she had trembled at it as often , and began to tremble again , at the idea of his coming up to speak to her , whatever might be the subject .

Fanny Price	agent	felt	The terror of his former occasional visits to that room seemed all renewed , and she felt as if he were going to examine her again in French and English . 
Fanny Price	agent	have	She was all attention , however , in placing a chair for him , and trying to appear honoured ; and , in her agitation , had quite overlooked the deficiencies of her apartment , till he , stopping short as he entered , said , with much surprise , “ Why have you no fire to - day ? ” 
Fanny Price	agent	sitting	There was snow on the ground , and she was sitting in a shawl . 
Fanny Price	agent	hesitated	She hesitated . 
Fanny Price	agent	sit	“ I am not cold , sir : I never sit here long at this time of year . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	have	In your bedchamber I know you _ can not _ have a fire . 
Fanny Price	agent	loved	Fanny would rather have been silent ; but being obliged to speak , she could not forbear , in justice to the aunt she loved best , from saying something in which the words “ my aunt Norris ” were distinguishable . 
Fanny Price	agent	have	You have an understanding which will prevent you from receiving things only in part , and judging partially by the event . 
Fanny Price	agent	take	You will take in the whole of the past , you will consider times , persons , and probabilities , and you will feel that _ they _ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you for that mediocrity of condition which _ seemed _ to be your lot .

Fanny Price	agent	obeyed	Fanny obeyed , with eyes cast down and colour rising . 
Fanny Price	agent	conjecture	His errand you may probably conjecture . ”

Fanny Price	agent	foreseen	Mr. Crawford , as you have perhaps foreseen , is yet in the house . 
Fanny Price	agent	cried	” “ You are mistaken , sir , ” cried Fanny , forced by the anxiety of the moment even to tell her uncle that he was wrong ; “ you are quite mistaken . 
Fanny Price	agent	gave	I gave him no encouragement yesterday . 
Fanny Price	agent	told	On the contrary , I told him , I can not recollect my exact words , but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him , that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect , and that I begged him never to talk to me in that manner again .

Fanny Price	agent	thought	I thought it might all pass for nothing with _ him _ . 
Fanny Price	agent	said	“ Yes , ” said Fanny , in a faint voice , and looking down with fresh shame ; and she did feel almost ashamed of herself , after such a picture as her uncle had drawn , for not liking Mr. Crawford .

Fanny Price	agent	agree	Do you agree with me , my dear ? ” “ Yes , sir . ” It was gently , but it was calmly said , and Sir Thomas was easy on the score of the cousins . 
Fanny Price	agent	picture	But the removal of his alarm did his niece no service : as her unaccountableness was confirmed his displeasure increased ; and getting up and walking about the room with a frown , which Fanny could picture to herself , though she dared not lift up her eyes , he shortly afterwards , and in a voice of authority , said , “ Have you any reason , child , to think ill of Mr. Crawford ’s temper ? ”

Fanny Price	agent	sunk	She longed to add , “ But of his principles I have ” ; but her heart sunk under the appalling prospect of discussion , explanation , and probably non - conviction . 
Fanny Price	agent	dare	Her ill opinion of him was founded chiefly on observations , which , for her cousins ’ sake , she could scarcely dare mention to their father . 
Fanny Price	agent	believed	Maria and Julia , and especially Maria , were so closely implicated in Mr. Crawford ’s misconduct , that she could not give his character , such as she believed it , without betraying them . 
Fanny Price	agent	hoped	She had hoped that , to a man like her uncle , so discerning , so honourable , so good , the simple acknowledgment of settled _ dislike _ on her side would have been sufficient . 
Fanny Price	agent	found	To her infinite grief she found it was not . 
Fanny Price	agent	sat	Sir Thomas came towards the table where she sat in trembling wretchedness , and with a good deal of cold sternness , said , “ It is of no use , I perceive , to talk to you . 
Fanny Price	agent	disappointed	I will , therefore , only add , as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct , that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed , and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what I had supposed .

Fanny Price	agent	think	You think only of yourself , and because

While Fanny ’s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes , her uncle was , soon after tea , called out of the room ; an occurrence too common to strike her , and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared ten minutes afterwards , and advancing decidedly towards herself , said , “ Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you , ma’am , in his own room . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	going	where are you going ? 
Fanny Price	agent	found	Mrs. Norris , much discontented , was obliged to compose herself to work again ; and Fanny , walking off in agitating consciousness , found herself , as she anticipated , in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford .

Fanny Price	agent	told	She told him that she did not love him , could not love him , was sure she never should love him ; that such a change was quite impossible ; that the subject was most painful to her ; that she must entreat him never to mention it again , to allow her to leave him at once , and let it be considered as concluded for ever .

Fanny Price	agent	said	All this she had said , and with the earnestness of sincerity ; yet this was not enough , for he immediately denied there being anything uncongenial in their characters , or anything unfriendly in their situations ; and positively declared , that he would still love , and still hope ! 
Fanny Price	agent	knew	Fanny knew her own meaning , but was no judge of her own manner . 
Fanny Price	agent	hated	Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who , as the clandestine , insidious , treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram , had been her abhorrence , whom she had hated to see or to speak to , in whom she could believe no good quality to exist , and whose power , even of being agreeable , she had barely acknowledged .

Fanny Price	agent	have	She must have a sensation of being honoured , and whether thinking of herself or her brother , she must have a strong feeling of gratitude . 
Fanny Price	agent	considered	The effect of the whole was a manner so pitying and agitated , and words intermingled with her refusal so expressive of obligation and concern , that to a temper of vanity and hope like Crawford ’s , the truth , or at least the strength of her indifference , might well be questionable ; and he was not so irrational as Fanny considered him , in the professions of persevering , assiduous , and not desponding attachment which closed the interview . 
Fanny Price	agent	go	It was with reluctance that he suffered her to go ; but there was no look of despair in parting to belie his words , or give her hopes of his being less unreasonable than he professed himself . 
Fanny Price	agent	reprobated	Here was again a something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated before . 
Fanny Price	agent	thought	So thought Fanny , in good truth and sober sadness , as she sat musing over that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs : wondering at the past and present ; wondering at what was yet to come , and in a nervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of her being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford , and the felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it .

Fanny Price	agent	done	I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls , as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred . 
Fanny Price	agent	see	You will see him with the rest of us , in the same manner , and , as much as you can , dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant . 
Fanny Price	agent	think	The promised departure was all that Fanny could think of with much satisfaction . 
Fanny Price	agent	considered	Her uncle ’s kind expressions , however , and forbearing manner , were sensibly felt ; and when she considered how much of the 
Fanny Price	agent	believed	truth was unknown to him , she believed she had no right to wonder at the line of conduct he pursued .

Fanny Price	agent	think	“ No , my dear , I should not think of missing you , when such an offer as this comes in your way . 
Fanny Price	agent	do	I could do very well without you , if you were married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford . 
Fanny Price	agent	received	This was almost the only rule of conduct , the only piece of advice , which Fanny had ever received from her aunt in the course of eight years and a half . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	She felt how unprofitable contention would be .

Fanny Price	agent	suspected	Fanny suspected what was going on . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	They sat so much longer than usual in the dining - parlour , that she was sure they must be talking of her ; and when tea at last brought them away , and she was to be seen by Edmund again , she felt dreadfully guilty . 
Fanny Price	agent	betrayed	He came to her , sat down by her , took her hand , and pressed it kindly ; and at that moment she thought that , but for the occupation and the scene which the tea - things afforded , she must have betrayed her emotion in some unpardonable excess . 
Fanny Price	agent	refusing	His surprise was not so great as his father ’s at her refusing Crawford , because , so far from supposing her to consider him with anything like a preference , he had always believed it to be rather the reverse , and could imagine her to be taken perfectly unprepared , but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more desirable than he did .

Fanny Price	agent	done	while honouring her for what she had done under the influence of her present indifference , honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas could quite echo , he was most earnest in hoping , and sanguine in believing , that it would be a match at last , and that , united by mutual affection , it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly fitted to make them blessed in each other , as he was now beginning seriously to consider them . 
Fanny Price	agent	sitting	When he and Crawford walked into the drawing - room , his mother and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if there were nothing else to care for . 
Fanny Price	agent	given	Not a look or an offer of help had Fanny given ; not a syllable for or against 
Fanny Price	agent	seemed	She seemed determined to be interested by nothing else . 
Fanny Price	agent	abstract	She could not abstract her mind five minutes : she was forced to listen ; his reading was capital , and her pleasure in good reading extreme . 
Fanny Price	agent	met	but in Mr. Crawford ’s reading there was a variety of excellence beyond what she had ever met with . 
Fanny Price	agent	slackened	Edmund watched the progress of her attention , and was amused and gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework , which at the beginning seemed to occupy her totally : how it fell from her hand while she sat motionless over it , and at last , how the eyes which had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were turned and fixed on Crawford — fixed on him for minutes , fixed on him , in short , till the attraction drew Crawford ’s upon her , and the book was closed , and the charm was broken .

Fanny Price	agent	listening	The two young men were the only talkers , but they , standing by the fire , talked over the too common neglect of the qualification , the total inattention to it , in the ordinary school - system for boys , the consequently natural , yet in some instances almost unnatural , degree of ignorance and uncouthness of men , of sensible and well - informed men , when suddenly called to the necessity of reading aloud , which had fallen within their notice , giving instances of blunders , and failures with their secondary causes , the want of management of the voice , of proper modulation and emphasis , of foresight and judgment , all proceeding from the first cause : want of early attention and habit ; and Fanny was listening again with great entertainment . 
Fanny Price	agent	saying	stepping eagerly to Fanny , and addressing her in a softened voice ; and upon her saying “ No , ” he added , “ Are you sure you did not speak ?

Fanny Price	agent	shook	Here Fanny , who could not but listen , involuntarily shook her head , and Crawford was instantly by her side again , entreating to know her meaning ; and as Edmund perceived , by his drawing in a chair , and sitting down close by her , that it was to be a very thorough attack , that looks and undertones were to be well tried , he sank as quietly as possible into a corner , turned his back , and took up a newspaper , very sincerely wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into explaining away that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her ardent lover ; and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the business from himself in murmurs of his own , over the various advertisements of “ A most desirable Estate in South Wales ” ; “ To Parents and Guardians ” ; and a “ Capital season’d Hunter . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	trying	Fanny , meanwhile , vexed with herself for not having been as motionless as she was speechless , and grieved to the heart to see Edmund ’s arrangements , was trying by everything in the power of her modest , gentle nature , to repulse Mr. Crawford , and avoid both his looks and inquiries ; and he , unrepulsable , was persisting in both .

Fanny Price	agent	think	Did you think me speaking improperly , lightly , irreverently on the subject ? 
Fanny Price	agent	try	In vain was her “ Pray , sir , do n’t ; pray , Mr. Crawford , ” repeated twice over ; and in vain did she try to move away . 
Fanny Price	agent	grew	She grew more agitated and displeased . 
Fanny Price	agent	astonish	You quite astonish me ; I wonder how you can — ” “ Do I astonish you ? ” said he . 
Fanny Price	agent	wonder	“ Do you wonder ? 
Fanny Price	agent	understand	Is there anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand ?

Fanny Price	agent	think	Did you think I ought ? ” 
Fanny Price	agent	said	“ Perhaps , sir , ” said Fanny , wearied at last into speaking—“perhaps , sir , I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as you seemed to do at that moment . ”

Fanny Price	agent	lead	CHAPTER XXXV Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse whether her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned between them or not ; and that if she did not lead the way , it should never be touched on by him ; but after a day or two of mutual reserve , he was induced by his father to change his mind , and try what his influence might do for his friend . 
Fanny Price	agent	need	If she did not need counsel , she must need the comfort of communication . 
Fanny Price	agent	wanting	Fanny estranged from him , silent and reserved , was an unnatural state of things ; a state which he must break through , and which he could easily learn to think she was wanting him to break through . 
Fanny Price	agent	walking	upon Sir Thomas ’s information of her being at that very time walking alone in the shrubbery , he instantly joined her . “ I am come to walk with you , Fanny , ” said he .

Fanny Price	agent	love	I am aware , more aware than Crawford can be , that the man who means to make you love him ( you having due notice of his intentions ) must have very uphill work , for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array ; and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate , which so many years ’ growth have confirmed , and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation .

Fanny Price	agent	have	I can not suppose that you have not the _ wish _ to love him — the natural wish of gratitude . 
Fanny Price	agent	said	” “ We are so totally unlike , ” said Fanny , avoiding a direct answer , “ we are so very , very different in all our inclinations and ways , that I consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together , even if I _ could _ like him .

Fanny Price	agent	saw	I then saw him behaving , as it appeared to me , so very improperly and unfeelingly — I may speak of it now because it is all over — so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth , not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him , and paying attentions to my cousin Maria , which — in short , at the time of the play , I received an impression which will never be got over .

Fanny Price	agent	let	“ My dear Fanny , ” replied Edmund , scarcely hearing her to the end , “ let us not , any of us , be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly .

Fanny Price	agent	seeing	Edmund first began again — “ I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday , particularly pleased , because I had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light .

Fanny Price	agent	spoke	She spoke of you , Fanny , just as she ought . 
Fanny Price	agent	desires	She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself . 
Fanny Price	agent	began	I should not have mentioned the subject , though very anxious to know her sentiments ; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart , and sweet peculiarity of manner , that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself . 
Fanny Price	agent	saw	“ It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	laments	“ Yes , she laments it ; yet owns it may have been best . 
Fanny Price	agent	goes	You will see her , however , before she goes .

Fanny Price	agent	said	wish you could have seen her countenance , when she said that you _ should _ be Henry ’s wife . 
Fanny Price	agent	spoke	And I observed that she always spoke of you as ‘ Fanny , ’ which she was never used to do ; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality .

Fanny Price	agent	thought	“ I _ should _ have thought , ” said Fanny , after a pause of recollection and exertion , “ that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man ’s not being approved , not being loved by some one of her sex at least , let him be ever so generally agreeable .

Fanny Price	agent	think	Let him have all the perfections in the world , I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning ; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me . 
Fanny Price	agent	thought	The higher his deserts , the more improper for me ever to have thought of him . 
Fanny Price	agent	given	You have now given exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant , and they were both better satisfied , though your warm - hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry . 
Fanny Price	agent	tolerate	Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour ; that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to ; and a great deal more to the same purpose , to give them a knowledge of your character . 
Fanny Price	agent	give	Fanny could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked for . 
Fanny Price	agent	feared	She feared she had been doing wrong : saying too much , overacting the caution which she had been fancying necessary ; in guarding against one evil , laying herself open to another ; and to have Miss Crawford ’s liveliness repeated to her at such a moment , and on such a subject , was a bitter aggravation . Edmund saw weariness and distress in her face , and immediately resolved to forbear all farther discussion ; and not even to mention the name of Crawford again , except as it might be connected with what _ must _ be agreeable to her .

Fanny Price	agent	made	You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice . ” Still , however , Fanny was oppressed and wearied ; he saw it in her looks , it could not be talked away ; and attempting it no more , he led her directly , with the kind authority of a privileged guardian , into the house . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	Edmund ’s account of Fanny ’s disposition he could believe to be just ; he supposed she had all those feelings , but he must consider it as very unfortunate that she _ had _ ; for , less willing than his son to trust to the future , he could not help fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit were necessary for her , she might not have persuaded herself into receiving his addresses properly before the young man ’s inclination for paying them were over .

Fanny Price	agent	lived	The promised visit from “ her friend , ” as Edmund called Miss Crawford , was a formidable threat to Fanny , and she lived in continual terror of it . 
Fanny Price	agent	said	As a sister , so partial and so angry , and so little scrupulous of what she said , and in another light so triumphant and secure , she was in every way an object of painful alarm . 
Fanny Price	agent	absented	She absented herself as little as possible from Lady Bertram , kept away from the East room , and took no solitary walk in the shrubbery , in her caution to avoid any sudden attack .

Fanny Price	agent	felt	She was determined to see Fanny alone , and therefore said to her tolerably soon , in a low voice , “ I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere ” ; words that Fanny felt all over her , in all her pulses and all her nerves . 
Fanny Price	agent	turned	Fanny naturally turned upstairs , and took her guest to the apartment which was now always fit for comfortable use ; opening the door , however , with a most aching heart , and feeling that she had a more distressing scene before her than ever that spot had yet witnessed .

Fanny Price	agent	have	I have not so much to say for my friend Flora , who jilted a very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway , who has about as much sense , Fanny , as Mr. Rushworth , but much worse - looking , and with a blackguard character . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	I _ had _ my doubts at the time about her being right , for he has not even the air of a gentleman , and now I am sure she was wrong .

Fanny Price	agent	allow	But , dear Fanny , you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies . 
Fanny Price	agent	seen	You must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power . 
Fanny Price	agent	received	you received it just as it was meant .

CHAPTER XXXVIII The novelty of travelling , and the happiness of being with William , soon produced their natural effect on Fanny ’s spirits , when Mansfield Park was fairly left behind ; and by the time their first stage was ended , and they were to quit Sir Thomas ’s carriage , she was able to take leave of the old coachman , and send back proper messages , with cheerful looks . Of pleasant talk between the brother and sister there was no end .

Fanny Price	agent	had	Miss Crawford ’s style of writing , lively and affectionate , was itself an evil , independent of what she was thus forced into reading from the brother ’s pen , for Edmund would never rest till she had read the chief of the letter to him ; and then she had to listen to his admiration of her language , and the warmth of her attachments . 
Fanny Price	agent	forced	There had , in fact , been so much of message , of allusion , of recollection , so much of Mansfield in every letter , that Fanny could not but suppose it meant for him to hear ; and to find herself forced into a purpose of that kind , compelled into a correspondence which was bringing her the addresses of the man she did not love , and obliging her to administer to the adverse passion of the man she did , was cruelly mortifying .

Fanny Price	agent	trusted	When no longer under the same roof with Edmund , she trusted that Miss Crawford would have no motive for writing strong enough to overcome the trouble , and that at Portsmouth their correspondence would dwindle into nothing . 
Fanny Price	agent	proceeded	With such thoughts as these , among ten hundred others , Fanny proceeded in her journey safely and cheerfully , and as expeditiously as could rationally be hoped in the dirty month of February .

Another moment 
Fanny Price	agent	loved	Fanny was in the narrow entrance - passage of the house , and in her mother ’s arms , who met her there with looks of true kindness , and with features which Fanny loved the more , because they brought her aunt Bertram ’s before her , and there were her two sisters : Susan , a well - grown fine girl of fourteen , and Betsey , the youngest of the family , about five — both glad to see her in their way , though with no advantage of manner in receiving her . But manner Fanny did not want . 
Fanny Price	agent	stood	She was then taken into a parlour , so small that her first conviction was of its being only a passage - room to something better , and she stood for a moment expecting to be invited on ; but when she saw there was no other door , and that there were signs of habitation before her , she called back her thoughts , reproved herself , and grieved lest they should have been suspected .

After sitting some time longer , a candle was obtained ; but as there was still no appearance of tea , nor , from Betsey ’s reports from the kitchen , much hope of any under a considerable period , William determined to go and change his dress , and make the necessary preparations for his removal on board directly , that he might have his tea in comfort afterwards .

Fanny Price	agent	wrote	CHAPTER XXXIX Could Sir Thomas have seen all his niece ’s feelings , when she wrote her first letter to her aunt , he would not have despaired ; for though a good night ’s rest , a pleasant morning , the hope of soon seeing William again , and the comparatively quiet state of the house , from Tom and Charles being gone to school , Sam on some project of his own , and her father on his usual lounges , enabled her to express herself cheerfully on the subject of home , there were still , to her own perfect consciousness , many drawbacks suppressed . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	Could he have seen only half that she felt before the end of a week , he would have thought Mr. Crawford sure of her , and been delighted with his own sagacity . Before the week ended , it was all disappointment . 
Fanny Price	agent	seen	The Thrush had had her orders , the wind had changed , and he was sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth ; and during those days she had seen him only twice , in a short and hurried way , when he had come ashore on duty .

Fanny Price	agent	regretted	Sam , loud and overbearing as he was , she rather regretted when he went , for he was clever and intelligent , and glad to be employed in any errand in the town ; and though spurning the remonstrances of Susan , given as they were , though very reasonable in themselves , with ill - timed and powerless warmth , was beginning to be influenced by

Fanny Price	agent	found	she found that the best of the three younger ones was gone in him : Tom and Charles being at least as many years as they were his juniors distant from that age of feeling and reason , which might suggest the expediency of making friends , and of endeavouring to be less disagreeable . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	Their sister soon despaired of making the smallest impression on _ them _ ; they were quite untameable by any means of address which she had spirits or time to attempt . 
Fanny Price	agent	learned	Every afternoon brought a return of their riotous games all over the house ; and she very early learned to sigh at the approach of Saturday ’s constant half - holiday . 
Fanny Price	agent	feared	Her continual disagreements with her mother , her rash squabbles with Tom and Charles , and petulance with Betsey , were at least so distressing to Fanny that , though admitting they were by no means without provocation , she feared the disposition that could push them to such length must be far from amiable , and from affording any repose to herself . 
Fanny Price	agent	think	Such was the home which was to put Mansfield out of her head , and teach her to think of her cousin Edmund with moderated feelings . 
Fanny Price	agent	think	On the contrary , she could think of nothing but Mansfield , its beloved inmates , its happy ways . 
Fanny Price	agent	continued	The usual plea of increasing engagements was made in excuse for not having written to her earlier ; “ And now that I have begun , ” she continued , “ my letter will not be worth your reading , for there will be no little offering of love at the end , no three or four lines _ passionnées _ from the most devoted H. C. in the world , for Henry is in Norfolk ; business called him to Everingham ten days ago , or perhaps he only pretended the call , for the sake of being travelling at 
Fanny Price	agent	seen	At last , after various attempts at meeting , I have seen your cousins , ‘ dear Julia and dearest Mrs. Rushworth ’ ; they found me at home yesterday , and we were glad to see each other again .

Fanny Price	agent	know	I was in it two years ago , when it was Lady Lascelle ’s , and prefer it to almost any I know in London , and certainly she will then feel , to use a vulgar phrase , that she has got her pennyworth for her penny . 
Fanny Price	agent	hope	I hope she will recollect it , and be satisfied , as well as she may , with moving the queen of a palace , though the king may appear best in the background ; and as I have no desire to tease her , I shall never _ force _ your name upon her again .

Fanny Price	agent	disdain	my dear sweet Fanny , this is a long letter from London : write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry ’s eyes , when he comes back , and send me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake . 
Fanny Price	agent	received	The first solid consolation which Fanny received for the evils of home , the first which her judgment could entirely approve , and which gave any promise of durability , was in a better knowledge of Susan , and a hope of being of service to her . 
Fanny Price	agent	became	That a girl of fourteen , acting only on her own unassisted reason , should err in the method of reform , was not wonderful ; and Fanny soon became more disposed to admire the natural light of the mind which could so early distinguish justly , than to censure severely the faults of conduct to which it led . 
Fanny Price	agent	cease	That her manner was wrong , however , at times very wrong , her measures often ill - chosen and ill - timed , and her looks and language very often indefensible , Fanny could not cease to feel ; but she began to hope they might be rectified .

Fanny Price	agent	found	Susan , she found , looked up to her and wished for her good opinion ; and new as anything like an office of authority was to Fanny , new as it was to imagine herself capable of guiding or informing any one , she did resolve to give occasional hints to Susan , and endeavour to exercise for her advantage the juster notions of what was due to everybody , and what would be wisest for herself , which her own more favoured education had fixed in her .

Fanny Price	agent	feared	It was made , however , at last : a silver knife was bought for Betsey , and accepted with great delight , its newness giving it every advantage over the other that could be desired ; Susan was established in the full possession of her own , Betsey handsomely declaring that now she had got one so much prettier herself , she should never want _ that _ again ; and no reproach seemed conveyed to the equally satisfied mother , which Fanny had almost feared to be impossible . 
Fanny Price	agent	gave	She gave advice , advice too sound to be resisted by a good understanding , and given so mildly and considerately as not to irritate an imperfect temper , and she had the happiness of observing its good effects not unfrequently .

Fanny Price	agent	heaved	In space , light , furniture , and prospect , there was nothing alike in the two apartments ; and she often heaved a sigh at the remembrance of all her books and boxes , and various comforts there . 
Fanny Price	agent	became	She became a subscriber ; amazed at being anything _ in propria persona _ , amazed at her own doings in every way , to be a renter , a chuser of books ! And to be having any one ’s improvement in view in her choice ! 
Fanny Price	agent	longed	Susan had read nothing , and Fanny longed to give her a share in her own first pleasures , and inspire a taste for the biography and poetry which she delighted in herself . 
Fanny Price	agent	hoped	In this occupation she hoped , moreover , to bury some of the recollections of Mansfield , which were too apt to seize her mind if her fingers only were busy ; and , especially at this time , hoped it might be useful in diverting her thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London , whither , on the authority of her aunt ’s last letter , she knew he was gone .

Fanny Price	agent	had	She had no doubt of what would ensue . 
Fanny Price	agent	failed	One morning , about this time , Fanny having now been nearly four weeks from Mansfield , a point which she never failed to think over and calculate every day , as she and Susan were preparing to remove , as usual , upstairs , they were stopped by the knock of a visitor , whom they felt they could not avoid , from Rebecca ’s alertness in going to the door , a duty which always interested her beyond any other .

Fanny Price	agent	turning	It was a gentleman ’s voice ; it was a voice that Fanny was just turning pale about , when Mr. Crawford walked into the room . 
Fanny Price	agent	fancied	Having introduced him , however , and being all reseated , the terrors that occurred of what this visit might lead to were overpowering , and she fancied herself on the point of fainting away . 
Fanny Price	agent	overflowing	Warmed by the sight of such a friend to her son , and regulated by the wish of appearing to advantage before him , she was overflowing with gratitude — artless , maternal gratitude — which could not be unpleasing . 
Fanny Price	agent	regretted	Mr. Price was out , which she regretted very much . 
Fanny Price	agent	regret	Fanny was just recovered enough to feel that _ she _ could not regret it ; for to her many other sources of uneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which he found her . 
Fanny Price	agent	scold	She might scold herself for the weakness , but there was no scolding it away . 
Fanny Price	agent	was	She might scold herself for the weakness , but there was no scolding it away . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	She felt that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life ; and was only astonished to find that , so great and so agreeable as he was , he should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to the port - admiral , nor the commissioner , nor yet with the intention of going over to the island , nor of seeing the dockyard .

Fanny Price	agent	listened	Fanny listened collectedly , even to the last - mentioned circumstance ; nay , it seemed a relief to her worn mind to be at any certainty ; and the words , “ then by this time it is all settled , ” passed internally , without more evidence of emotion than a faint blush . 
Fanny Price	agent	found	And the consequence was , that Fanny , strange as it was — strange , awkward , and distressing — found herself and Susan , within ten minutes , walking towards the High Street with Mr. Crawford .

Fanny Price	agent	have	She could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr. Crawford must be struck . 
Fanny Price	agent	wanting	He must soon give her up , and cease to have the smallest inclination for the match ; and yet , though she had been so much wanting his affection to be cured , this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as the complaint ; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever , agreeable man , than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations . 
Fanny Price	agent	bear	He took care , however , that they should be allowed to go to the shops they came out expressly to visit ; and it did not delay them long , for Fanny could so little bear to excite impatience , or be waited for , that before the gentlemen , as they stood at the door , could do more than begin upon the last naval regulations , or settle the number of three - deckers now in commission , their companions were ready to proceed 
Fanny Price	agent	turned	She turned away , and wished he would not say such things . 
Fanny Price	agent	wished	She turned away , and wished he would not say such things . 
Fanny Price	agent	began	She began to feel the possibility of his turning out well at last ; but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her , and ought not to think of her . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	Now so long divided from everybody who knew the place , she felt it quite the voice of a friend when he mentioned it , and led the way to her fond exclamations in praise of its beauties and comforts , and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed her to gratify her own heart in the warmest eulogium , in speaking of her uncle as all that was clever and good , and her aunt as having the sweetest of all sweet tempers .

Fanny Price	agent	forced	Fanny was doubly silenced here ; though when the moment was passed , could regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged comprehension of one half of his meaning , and encouraged him to say something more of his sister and Edmund . 
Fanny Price	agent	wished	, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute ’s privacy for telling Fanny that his only business in Portsmouth was to see her ; that he was come down for a couple of days on her account , and hers only , and because he could not endure a longer total separation . She was sorry , really sorry ; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said , she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him ; he was much more gentle , obliging , and attentive to other people ’s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield ; she had never seen him so agreeable — so _ near _ being agreeable ; his behaviour to her father could not offend , and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of Susan . He was decidedly improved .

Fanny Price	agent	know	Thither they now went ; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider the Miss Prices as his peculiar charge ; and before they had been there long , somehow or other , there was no saying how , Fanny could not have believed it , but he was walking between them with an arm of each under his , and she did not know how to prevent or put an end to it .

Fanny Price	agent	thanked	Fanny thanked him again , but was affected and distressed to a degree that made it impossible for her to say much , or even to be certain of what she ought to say . 
Fanny Price	agent	affected	Fanny thanked him again , but was affected and distressed to a degree that made it impossible for her to say much , or even to be certain of what she ought to say .

Fanny Price	agent	turned	He _ went to while away the next three hours as he could , with his other acquaintance , till the best dinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment , and _ she _ turned in to her more simple one immediately . 
Fanny Price	agent	endured	Their general fare bore a very different character ; and could he have suspected how many privations , besides that of exercise , she endured in her father ’s house , he would have wondered that her looks were not much more affected than he found them . 
Fanny Price	agent	send	She was so little equal to Rebecca ’s puddings and Rebecca ’s hashes , brought to table , as they all were , with such accompaniments of half - cleaned plates , and not half - cleaned knives and forks , that she was very often constrained to defer her heartiest meal till she could send her brothers in the evening for biscuits and buns . 
Fanny Price	agent	die	After being nursed up at Mansfield , it was too late in the day to be hardened at Portsmouth ; and though Sir Thomas , had he known all , might have thought his niece in the most promising way of being starved , both mind and body , into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford ’s good company and good fortune , he would probably have feared to push his experiment farther , lest she might die under the cure . Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day . 
Fanny Price	agent	help	Though tolerably secure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again , she could not help being low . 
Fanny Price	agent	think	It was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend ; and though , in one light , glad to have him gone , it seemed as if she was now deserted by everybody ; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield ; and she could not think of his returning to town , and being frequently with Mary and Edmund , without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate herself for having them .

Fanny Price	agent	fancied	The wonderful improvement which she still fancied in Mr. Crawford was the nearest to administering comfort of anything within the current of her thoughts . 
Fanny Price	agent	seeing	Not considering in how different a circle she had been just seeing him , nor how much might be owing to contrast , she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and regardful of others than formerly . 
Fanny Price	agent	read	CHAPTER XLIII It was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back , to London , on the morrow , for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price ’s ; and two days afterwards , it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letter from his sister , opened and read by her , on another account , with the most anxious curiosity : 
Fanny Price	agent	have	— “ I have to inform you , my dearest Fanny , that Henry has been down to Portsmouth to see you ; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday , and one still more to be dwelt on the next day , on the ramparts ; when the balmy air , the sparkling sea , and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony , and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect . 
Fanny Price	agent	understand	This , as well as I understand , is to be the substance of my information . 
Fanny Price	agent	write	He makes me write , but I do not know what else is to be communicated , except this said visit to Portsmouth , and these two said walks , and his introduction to your family , especially to a fair sister of yours , a fine girl of fifteen , who was of the party on the ramparts , taking her first lesson , I presume , in love .

Fanny Price	agent	have	You have politics , of course ; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people and parties that fill up my time . 
Fanny Price	agent	go	; suffice it , that everything was just as it ought to be , in a style that any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness , and that her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit . My friend , Mrs. Fraser , is mad for such a house , and it would not make _ me _ miserable . I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter ; she seems in high spirits , and very happy .

Fanny Price	agent	say	I will say , then , that we have seen him two or three times , and that my friends here are very much struck with his gentlemanlike appearance . 
Fanny Price	agent	confess	Mrs. Fraser ( no bad judge ) declares she knows but three men in town who have so good a person , height , and air ; and I must confess , when he dined here the other day , there were none to compare with him , and we were a party of sixteen . 
Fanny Price	agent	told	What Fanny told her of former times dwelt more on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith ; and she paid her sister the compliment of preferring her style to that of any printed author .

Fanny Price	agent	indulge	Susan , who had an innate taste for the genteel and well - appointed , was eager to hear , and Fanny could not but indulge herself in dwelling on so beloved a theme . 
Fanny Price	agent	hoped	She hoped it was not wrong ; though , after a time , Susan ’s very great admiration of everything said or done in her uncle ’s house , and earnest longing to go into Northamptonshire , seemed almost to blame her for exciting feelings which could not be gratified . Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her elder sister ; and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this , she began to feel that when her own release from Portsmouth came , her happiness would have a material drawback in leaving Susan behind .

Fanny Price	agent	return	And had it been possible for her to return Mr. Crawford ’s regard , the probability of his being very far from objecting to such a measure would have been the greatest increase of all her own comforts .

Fanny Price	agent	left	I am returned to Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it . 
Fanny Price	agent	ask	I ask no questions . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	I had every attention from the Frasers that could be reasonably expected . 
Fanny Price	agent	say	I dare say I was not reasonable in carrying with me hopes of an intercourse at all like that of Mansfield . 
Fanny Price	agent	see	Had she been different when I did see her , I should have made no complaint , but from the very first she was altered 
Fanny Price	agent	hoped	: my first reception was so unlike what I had hoped , that I had almost resolved on leaving London again directly . 
Fanny Price	agent	resolved	: my first reception was so unlike what I had hoped , that I had almost resolved on leaving London again directly . 
Fanny Price	agent	like	I do not like Mrs. Fraser . 
Fanny Price	agent	look	I look upon her intimacy with those two sisters as the greatest misfortune of her life and mine . 
Fanny Price	agent	despair	Could she be detached from them!—and sometimes I do not despair of it , for the affection appears to me principally on their side . 
Fanny Price	agent	think	When I think of her great attachment to you , indeed , and the whole of her judicious , upright conduct as a sister , she appears a very different creature , capable of everything noble , and I am ready to blame myself for a too harsh construction of a playful manner . 
Fanny Price	agent	give	I can not give her up , Fanny . 
Fanny Price	agent	think	She is the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife . 
Fanny Price	agent	believe	, of course I should not say this , but I do believe it . 
Fanny Price	agent	have	I have no jealousy of any individual . 
Fanny Price	agent	fear	It is the habits of wealth that I fear . 
Fanny Price	agent	think	That would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices , which , in fact , I am scarcely justified in asking ; and , if I am refused , that , I think , will be the honest motive . 
Fanny Price	agent	trust	Her prejudices , I trust , are not so strong as they were . 
Fanny Price	agent	feel	Having once begun , it is a pleasure to me to tell you all I feel . 
Fanny Price	agent	give	I can not give her up . 
Fanny Price	agent	hope	Connected as we already are , and , I hope , are to be , to give up Mary Crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me ; to banish myself from the very houses and friends whom , under any other distress , I should turn to for consolation .

Fanny Price	agent	saw	The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser ’s party . 
Fanny Price	agent	see	I am more and more satisfied with all that I see and hear of him . 
Fanny Price	agent	acknowledge	I could not see him and my eldest sister in the same room without recollecting what you once told me , and I acknowledge that they did not meet as friends . 
Fanny Price	agent	saw	I saw him draw back surprised , and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any former supposed slight to Miss Bertram . 
Fanny Price	agent	hope	I hope they get on pretty well together .

Fanny Price	agent	checked	Fanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as she could , but she was within half a minute of starting the idea that Sir Thomas was quite unkind , both to her aunt and to herself . 
Fanny Price	agent	said	“ There is no good in this delay , ” said she . 
Fanny Price	agent	looked	She looked over the letter again . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	It was a letter , in short , which she would not but have had for the world , and which could never be valued enough . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund ’s letter , Fanny had one from her aunt , beginning thus — “ My Dear Fanny,—I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming intelligence , which I make no doubt will give you much concern ” . This was a great deal better than to have to take up the pen to acquaint her with all the particulars of the Grants ’ intended journey , for the present intelligence was of a nature to promise occupation for the pen for many days to come , being no less than the dangerous illness of her eldest son , of which they had received notice by express a few hours before . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	She felt truly for them all . 
Fanny Price	agent	find	She could just find selfishness enough to wonder whether Edmund _ had _ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came , but no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate and disinterestedly anxious . 
Fanny Price	agent	dwelt	She could just find selfishness enough to wonder whether Edmund _ had _ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came , but no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate and disinterestedly anxious . 
Fanny Price	agent	wrote	Her aunt did not neglect her : she wrote again and again ; they were receiving frequent accounts from Edmund , and these accounts were as regularly transmitted to Fanny , in the same diffuse style , and the same medley of trusts , hopes , and fears , all following and producing each other at haphazard . 
Fanny Price	agent	wrote	The sufferings which Lady Bertram did not see had little power over her fancy ; and she wrote very comfortably about agitation , and anxiety , and poor invalids , till Tom was actually conveyed to Mansfield , and her own eyes had beheld his altered appearance . 
Fanny Price	agent	preparing	Then a letter which she had been previously preparing for Fanny was finished in a different style , in the language of real feeling and alarm ; then she wrote as she might have spoken .

Fanny Price	agent	find	Fanny would certainly believe him so at least , and must find that her estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared as the attendant , supporter , cheerer of a suffering brother . 
Fanny Price	agent	thought	There was not only the debility of recent illness to assist : there was also , as she now learnt , nerves much affected , spirits much depressed to calm and raise , and her own imagination added that there must be a mind to be properly guided . The family were not consumptive , and she was more inclined to hope than fear for her cousin , except when she thought of Miss Crawford ; but Miss Crawford gave her the idea of being the child of good luck , and to her selfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only son . Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	Easter came particularly late this year , as Fanny had most sorrowfully considered , on first learning that she had no chance of leaving Portsmouth till after it . 
Fanny Price	agent	heard	It came , and she had yet heard nothing of her return — nothing even of the going to London , which was to precede her return .

Fanny Price	agent	have	I have not time or patience to give half Henry ’s messages 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	” Fanny ’s disgust at the greater part of this letter , with her extreme reluctance to bring the writer of it and her cousin Edmund together , would have made her ( as she felt ) incapable of judging impartially whether the concluding offer might be accepted or not .

Fanny Price	agent	finding	To be finding herself , perhaps within three days , transported to Mansfield , was an image of the greatest felicity , but it would have been a material drawback to be owing such felicity to persons in whose feelings and conduct , at the present moment , she saw so much to condemn : the sister ’s feelings , the brother ’s conduct , _ her _ cold - hearted ambition , _ his _ thoughtless vanity .

Fanny Price	agent	thought	She had thought better of him .

Fanny Price	agent	had	Her awe of her uncle , and her dread of taking a liberty with him , made it instantly plain to her what she had to do .

Fanny Price	agent	gave	She thanked Miss Crawford , but gave a decided negative . 
Fanny Price	agent	supposed	as her cousin ’s illness had continued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary , she must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present , and that she should be felt an encumbrance . ” Her representation of her cousin ’s state at this time was exactly according to her own belief of it , and such as she supposed would convey to the sanguine mind of her correspondent the hope of everything she was wishing for .

Fanny Price	agent	suspected	Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman , it seemed , under certain conditions of wealth ; and this , she suspected , was all the conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate himself upon . 
Fanny Price	agent	learnt	She had only learnt to think nothing of consequence but money . 
Fanny Price	agent	doubt	As Fanny could not doubt that her answer was conveying a real disappointment , she was rather in expectation , from her knowledge of Miss Crawford ’s temper , of being urged again ; and though no second letter arrived for the space of a week , she had still the same feeling when it did come . On receiving it , she could instantly decide on its containing little writing , and was persuaded of its having the air of a letter of haste and business .

Fanny Price	agent	opened	If two moments , however , can surround with difficulties , a third can disperse them ; and before she had opened the letter , the possibility of Mr. and Miss Crawford ’s having applied to her uncle and obtained his permission was giving her ease . 
Fanny Price	agent	write	Say not a word of it ; hear nothing , surmise nothing , whisper nothing till I write again . 
Fanny Price	agent	lay	If they are gone , I would lay my life they are only gone to Mansfield Park , and Julia with them .

Fanny Price	agent	understand	, it was impossible for her to understand much of this strange letter . 
Fanny Price	agent	perceive	She could only perceive that it must relate to Wimpole Street and Mr. Crawford , and only conjecture that something very imprudent had just occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world , and to excite her jealousy , in Miss Crawford ’s apprehension , if she heard it .

Fanny Price	agent	hoped	As to Mr. Crawford , she hoped it might give him a knowledge of his own disposition , convince him that he was not capable of being steadily attached to any one woman in the world , and shame him from persisting any longer in addressing herself . 
Fanny Price	agent	begun	She had begun to think he really loved her , and to fancy his affection for her something more than common ; and his sister still said that he cared for nobody else . 
Fanny Price	agent	heard	Very uncomfortable she was , and must continue , till she heard from Miss Crawford again . 
Fanny Price	agent	relieve	It was impossible to banish the letter from her thoughts , and she could not relieve herself by speaking of it to any human being . 
Fanny Price	agent	think	She could still think of little else all the morning ; but , when her father came back in the afternoon with the daily newspaper as usual , she was so far from expecting any elucidation through such a channel that the subject was for a moment out of her head . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	She felt that she had , indeed , been three months there ; and the sun ’s rays falling strongly into the parlour , instead of cheering , made her still more melancholy , for sunshine appeared to her a totally different thing in a town and in the country .

Fanny Price	agent	sat	She sat in a blaze of oppressive heat , in a cloud of moving dust , and her eyes could only wander from the walls , marked by her father ’s head , to the table cut and notched by her brothers , where stood the tea - board never thoroughly cleaned , the cups and saucers wiped in streaks , the milk a mixture of motes floating in thin blue , and the bread and butter growing every minute more greasy than even Rebecca ’s hands had first produced it . Her father read his newspaper , and her mother lamented over the ragged carpet as usual , while the tea was in preparation , and wished Rebecca would mend it ; and Fanny was first roused by his calling out to her , after humphing and considering over a particular paragraph : “ What ’s the name of your great cousins in town , Fan ? ”

Fanny Price	agent	read	Fanny read to herself that “ it was with infinite concern the newspaper had to announce to the world a matrimonial _ fracas _ in the family of Mr. R. of Wimpole Street ; the beautiful Mrs. R. , whose name had not long been enrolled in the lists of Hymen , and who had promised to become so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world , having quitted her husband ’s roof in company with the well - known and captivating Mr. C. , the intimate friend and associate of Mr. R. , and it was not known even to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone . ” “ It is a mistake , sir , ” said Fanny instantly ; “ it must be a mistake , it can not be true ; it must mean some other people . ”

Fanny Price	agent	seemed	Fanny seemed to herself never to have been shocked before . 
Fanny Price	agent	passed	She passed only from feelings of sickness to shudderings of horror ; and from hot fits of fever to cold . 
Fanny Price	agent	thought	The event was so shocking , that there were moments even when her heart revolted from it as impossible : when she thought it could not be . 
Fanny Price	agent	confined	She confined herself , or tried to confine herself , to the simple , indubitable family misery which must envelop all , if it were indeed a matter of certified guilt and public exposure . 
Fanny Price	agent	tried	She confined herself , or tried to confine herself , to the simple , indubitable family misery which must envelop all , if it were indeed a matter of certified guilt and public exposure . 
Fanny Price	agent	paused	The mother ’s sufferings , the father ’s ; there she paused . 
Fanny Price	agent	think	Sir Thomas ’s parental solicitude and high sense of honour and decorum , Edmund ’s upright principles , unsuspicious temper , and genuine strength of feeling , made her think it scarcely possible for them to support life and reason under such disgrace ; and it appeared to her that , as far as this world alone was concerned , the greatest blessing to every one of kindred with Mrs. Rushworth would be instant annihilation . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	She had , indeed , scarcely the shadow of a hope to soothe her mind , and was reduced to so low and wan and trembling a condition , as no mother , not unkind , except Mrs. Price could have overlooked , when the third day did bring the sickening knock , and a letter was again put into her hands .

Fanny Price	agent	wanted	Never had Fanny more wanted a cordial . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	Never had she felt such a one as this letter contained . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	She was , she felt she was , in the greatest danger of being exquisitely happy , while so many were miserable .

Fanny Price	agent	learn	She dreaded lest she should learn to be insensible of it . 
Fanny Price	agent	thought	To be going so soon , sent for so kindly , sent for as a comfort , and with leave to take Susan , was altogether such a combination of blessings as set her heart in a glow , and for a time seemed to distance every pain , and make her incapable of suitably sharing the distress even of those whose distress she thought of most . 
Fanny Price	agent	went	The girls heard his entrance from above , and Fanny went down . 
Fanny Price	agent	entered	She was ready to sink as she entered the parlour . 
Fanny Price	agent	found	He was alone , and met her instantly ; and she found herself pressed to his heart with only these words , just articulate , “ My Fanny , my only sister ; my only comfort now ! ”

Fanny Price	agent	answered	Fanny answered for their having breakfasted and being quite ready in half an hour . 
Fanny Price	agent	knew	She knew it must be so , but it was terrible to her . 
Fanny Price	agent	passed	Fanny ’s last meal in her father ’s house was in character with her first : she was dismissed from it as hospitably as she had been welcomed . How her heart swelled with joy and gratitude as she passed the barriers of Portsmouth , and how Susan ’s face wore its broadest smiles , may be easily conceived . 
Fanny Price	agent	screened	Sitting forwards , however , and screened by her bonnet , those smiles were unseen . 
Fanny Price	agent	watched	Fanny watched him with never - failing solicitude , and sometimes catching his eye , revived an affectionate smile , which comforted her ; but the first day ’s journey passed without her hearing a word from him on the subjects that were weighing him down .

Fanny Price	agent	feel	Just before their setting out from Oxford , while Susan was stationed at a window , in eager observation of the departure of a large family from the inn , the other two were standing by the fire ; and Edmund , particularly struck by the alteration in Fanny ’s looks , and from his ignorance of the daily evils of her father ’s house , attributing an undue share of the change , attributing _ all _ to the recent event , took her hand , and said in a low , but very expressive tone , “ No wonder — you must feel it — you must suffer .

Fanny Price	agent	meditating	Visions of good and ill breeding , of old vulgarisms and new gentilities , were before her ; and she was meditating much upon silver forks , napkins , and finger - glasses . 
Fanny Price	agent	quitting	It was three months , full three months , since her quitting it , and the change was from winter to summer . 
Fanny Price	agent	looked	She looked at him , but he was leaning back , sunk in a deeper gloom than ever , and with eyes closed , as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him , and the lovely scenes of home must be shut out .

Fanny Price	agent	passed	Fanny had scarcely passed the solemn - looking servants , when Lady Bertram came from the drawing - room to meet her ; came with no indolent step ; and falling on her neck , said , “ Dear Fanny ! now I shall be comfortable . ”

Fanny Price	agent	do	devoted to her aunt Bertram , returning to every former office with more than former zeal , and thinking she could never do enough for one who seemed so much to want her . 
Fanny Price	agent	found	After a time , Fanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other subjects , and revive some interest in the usual occupations ; but whenever Lady Bertram _ was _ fixed on the event , she could see it only in one light , as comprehending the loss of a daughter , and a disgrace never to be wiped off .

Fanny Price	agent	learnt	Fanny learnt from her all the particulars which had yet transpired . 
Fanny Price	agent	knew	Her aunt was no very methodical narrator , but with the help of some letters to and from Sir Thomas , and what she already knew herself , and could reasonably combine , she was soon able to understand quite as much as she wished of the circumstances attending the story .

Fanny Price	agent	knew	His having been in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew . 
Fanny Price	agent	bear	Sir Thomas , however , remained yet a little longer in town , in the hope of discovering and snatching her from farther vice , though all was lost on the side of character . _ His _ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of . 
Fanny Price	agent	knew	Tom ’s complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his sister ’s conduct , and his recovery so much thrown back by it , that even Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference , and all her alarms were regularly sent off to her husband ; and Julia ’s elopement , the additional blow which had met him on his arrival in London , though its force had been deadened at the moment , must , she knew , be sorely felt . She saw that it was .

She saw that it was . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	Fanny felt for him most acutely . 
Fanny Price	agent	trusted	His displeasure against herself she trusted , reasoning differently from Mrs. Norris , would now be done away . 
Fanny Price	agent	belong	Fanny was not in the secret of her uncle ’s feelings , Sir Thomas not in the secret of Miss Crawford ’s character . Had he been privy to her conversation with his son , he would not have wished her to belong to him , though her twenty thousand pounds had been forty . 
Fanny Price	agent	knew	That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit of a doubt with Fanny ; and yet , till she knew that he felt the same , her own conviction was insufficient .

Fanny Price	agent	saw	She seldom saw him : never alone . 
Fanny Price	agent	hope	Long , long would it be ere Miss Crawford ’s name passed his lips again , or she could hope for a renewal of such confidential intercourse as had been . 
Fanny Price	agent	listened	How Fanny listened , with what curiosity and concern , what pain and what delight , how the agitation of his voice was watched , and how carefully her own eyes were fixed on any object but himself , may be imagined . 
Fanny Price	agent	watched	How Fanny listened , with what curiosity and concern , what pain and what delight , how the agitation of his voice was watched , and how carefully her own eyes were fixed on any object but himself , may be imagined .

Fanny Price	agent	watching	After repeating this , Edmund was so much affected that Fanny , watching him with silent , but most tender concern , was almost sorry that the subject had been entered on at all . 
Fanny Price	agent	said	I have told you the substance of all that she said . 
Fanny Price	agent	inflicting	As soon as I could speak , I replied that I had not supposed it possible , coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done , that anything could occur to make me suffer more , but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence . That though I had , in the course of our acquaintance , been often sensible of some difference in our opinions , on points , too , of some moment , 
Fanny Price	agent	proved	it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it .

Fanny Price	agent	change	I saw her change countenance . 
Fanny Price	agent	turned	She turned extremely red . 
Fanny Price	agent	laughed	She would have laughed if she could . 
Fanny Price	agent	answered	It was a sort of laugh , as she answered , ‘ A pretty good lecture , upon my word . 
Fanny Price	agent	tried	She tried to speak carelessly , 
Fanny Price	agent	wanted	but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear . 
Fanny Price	agent	learn	I only said in reply , that from my heart I wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room .

Fanny Price	agent	said	‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she . 
Fanny Price	agent	said	‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she , with a smile ; but it was a smile ill - suited to the conversation that had passed , a saucy playful smile , seeming to invite in order to subdue me ; at least it appeared so to me . 
Fanny Price	agent	fallen	Till that happened , they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone , and how she had attached him , and how delightful nature had made her , and how excellent she would have been , had she fallen into good hands earlier . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	Fanny , now at liberty to speak openly , felt more than justified in adding to his knowledge of her real character , by some hint of what share his brother ’s state of health might be supposed to have in her wish for a complete reconciliation . 
Fanny Price	agent	thought	Fanny thought exactly the same ; and they were also quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect , the indelible impression , which such a disappointment must make on his mind . 
Fanny Price	agent	felt	She must have been a happy creature in spite of all that she felt , or thought she felt , for the distress of those around her .

Fanny Price	agent	thought	She must have been a happy creature in spite of all that she felt , or thought she felt , for the distress of those around her . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	She had sources of delight that must force their way . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	She was returned to Mansfield Park , she was useful , she was beloved ; she was safe from Mr. Crawford ; and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits , of his perfect approbation and increased regard ; and happy as all this must make her , she would still have been happy without any of it , for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford . 
Fanny Price	agent	knew	She knew it was so , and was sorry ; but it was with a sorrow so founded on satisfaction , so tending to ease , and so much in harmony with every dearest sensation , that there are few who might not have been glad to exchange their greatest gaiety for it . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	Not even Fanny had tears for aunt Norris , not even when she was gone for ever . 
Fanny Price	agent	loved	She loved him ; there was no withdrawing attentions avowedly dear to her . 
Fanny Price	agent	growing	Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford , and observing to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such another woman , before it began to strike him whether a very different kind of woman might not do just as well , or a great deal better : whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear , as important to him in all her smiles and all her ways , as Mary Crawford had ever been ; and whether it might not be a possible , a hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love . I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion , that every one may be at liberty to fix their own , aware that the cure of unconquerable passions , and the transfer of unchanging attachments , must vary much as to time in different people . 
Fanny Price	agent	desire	I only entreat everybody to believe that exactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so , and not a week earlier , Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford , and became as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire . 
Fanny Price	agent	deserving	, there was nothing on the side of prudence to stop him or make his progress slow ; no doubts of her deserving , no fears of opposition of taste , no need of drawing new hopes of happiness from dissimilarity of temper . 
Fanny Price	agent	wish	No happiness of son or niece could make her wish the marriage . 
Fanny Price	agent	had	With quickness in understanding the tempers of those she had to deal with , and no natural timidity to restrain any consequent wishes , she was soon welcome and useful to all ; and after Fanny ’s removal succeeded so naturally to her influence over the hourly comfort of her aunt , as gradually to become , perhaps , the most beloved of the two . 
Fanny Price	agent	go	Does she go to balls ? 
Fanny Price	agent	dine	Does she dine out every where , as well as at my sister ’s ? ” “ No , ” replied Edmund ; “ I do not think she has ever been to a ball . 
Fanny Price	agent	has	“ Miss Price has a brother at sea , ” said Edmund , “ whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us . ”

Fanny Price	agent	has	“ At sea , has she ? 
Fanny Price	agent	please	“ My dear Miss Price , ” said Miss Crawford , as soon as she was at all within hearing , “ I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting ; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself — I knew it was very late , and that I was behaving extremely ill ; and therefore , if you please , you must forgive me .

Fanny Price	agent	know	Selfishness must always be forgiven , you know , because there is no hope of a cure . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	have	Miss Price , I give way to you with a very bad grace ; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride , and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear , delightful , beautiful animal . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	know	It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world , and Miss Price has found it so , though she did not know it . ” “ I shall soon be rested , ” said Fanny ; “ to sit in the shade on a fine day , and look upon verdure , is the most perfect refreshment . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	rehearse	I have brought my book , and if you would but rehearse it with me , I should be _ so _ obliged ! 
Fanny Price	agent	happened	” Fanny was most civil in her assurances , though she could not give them in a very steady voice . “ Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean ? ” continued Miss Crawford , opening her book . 
Fanny Price	agent	do	Could you do it ? 
Fanny Price	agent	rehearse	You must rehearse it with me , that I may fancy _ you _ him , and get on by degrees .

Fanny Price	agent	do	I do not imagine he figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park ; do you , Miss Price ? 
Fanny Price	agent	trying	” “ I shall keep clear of you , Crawford , as long as I can , ” said Edmund ; “ for you would be more likely to disconcert me , and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man . ” 
Fanny Price	agent	spoken	There is _ one _ person in company who does not like to have Miss Price spoken of . 
Fanny Price	agent	known	But Miss Price had not been brought up to the trade of _ coming _ _ out _ ; and had she known in what light this ball was , in general , considered respecting her , it would very much have lessened her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doing wrong and being looked at .

Fanny Price	agent	came	Mrs. Chapman had just reached the attic floor , when Miss Price came out of her room completely dressed , and only civilities were necessary ; but Fanny felt her aunt ’s attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman could do themselves . CHAPTER XXVIII 
Fanny Price	agent	fared	Miss Ward , at the end of half a dozen years , found herself obliged to be attached to the Rev. Mr. Norris , a friend of her brother - in - law , with scarcely any private fortune , and Miss Frances fared yet worse . 
Fanny Price	agent	married	But Miss Frances married , in the common phrase , to disoblige her family , and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines , without education , fortune , or connexions , did it very thoroughly . 
Fanny Price	agent	got	and an answer , which comprehended each sister in its bitterness , and bestowed such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir Thomas as Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herself , put an end to all intercourse between them for a considerable period . Their homes were so distant , and the circles in which they moved so distinct , as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each other ’s existence during the eleven following years , or , at least , to make it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have it in her power to tell them , as she now and then did , in an angry voice , that Fanny had got another child .

Fanny Price	agent	had	She had a letter from him herself , a few hurried happy lines , written as the ship came up Channel , and sent into Portsmouth with the first boat that left the Antwerp at anchor in Spithead ; and when Crawford walked up with the newspaper in his hand , which he had hoped would bring the first tidings , he found her trembling with joy over this letter , and listening with a glowing , grateful countenance to the kind invitation which her uncle was most collectedly dictating in reply . It was but the day before that Crawford had made himself thoroughly master of the subject , or had in fact become at all aware of her having such a brother , or his being in such a ship , but the interest then excited had been very properly lively , determining him on his return to town to apply for information as to the probable period of the Antwerp ’s return from the Mediterranean , etc . ; and the good luck which attended his early examination of ship news the next morning seemed the reward of his ingenuity in finding out such a method of pleasing her , as well as of his dutiful attention to the Admiral , in having for many years taken in the paper esteemed to have the earliest naval intelligence .

Fanny Price	agent	found	There could be no doubt of his obtaining leave of absence immediately , for he was still only a midshipman ; and as his parents , from living on the spot , must already have seen him , and be seeing him perhaps daily , his direct holidays might with justice be instantly given to the sister , who had been his best correspondent through a period of seven years , and the uncle who had done most for his support and advancement ; and accordingly the reply to her reply , fixing a very early day for his arrival , came as soon as possible ; and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny had been in the agitation of her first dinner - visit , when she found herself in an agitation of a higher nature , watching in the hall , in the lobby , on the stairs , for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her a brother . It came happily while she was thus waiting ; and there being neither ceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment of meeting , she was with him as he entered the house , and the first minutes of exquisite feeling had no interruption and no witnesses , unless the servants chiefly intent upon opening the proper doors could be called such .

Fanny Price	agent	shewed	This was exactly what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at , as each proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they both advised Mrs. Norris ’s continuing where she was , instead of rushing out into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them . William and Fanny soon shewed themselves ; and Sir Thomas had the pleasure of receiving , in his protégé , certainly a very different person from the one he had equipped seven years ago , but a young man of an open , pleasant countenance , and frank , unstudied , but feeling and respectful manners , and such as confirmed him his friend .

Fanny Price	agent	recover	It was long before Fanny could recover from the agitating happiness of such an hour as was formed by the last thirty minutes of expectation , and the first of fruition ; it was some time even before her happiness could be said to make her happy , before the disappointment inseparable from the alteration of person had vanished , and she could see in him the same William as before , and talk to him , as her heart had been yearning to do through many a past year .

Fanny Price	agent	feel	Yes , Mary , my Fanny will feel a difference indeed : a daily , hourly difference , in the behaviour of every being who approaches her ; and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer of it , that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her due . 
Fanny Price	patient	received	Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly ; and Sir Thomas , seeing how much she needed encouragement , tried to be all that was conciliating : but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of deportment ; and Lady Bertram , without taking half so much trouble , or speaking one word where he spoke ten , by the mere aid of a good - humoured smile , became immediately the less awful character of the two . 
Fanny Price	patient	interrupted	In vain were the well - meant condescensions of Sir Thomas , and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that she would be a good girl ; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug , and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart towards giving her comfort ; she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her , and sleep seeming to be her likeliest friend , she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed

Fanny Price	patient	mortified	Her elder cousins mortified her by reflections on her size , and abashed her by noticing her shyness : Miss Lee wondered at her ignorance , and the maid - servants sneered at her clothes ; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers and sisters among whom she had always been important as playfellow , instructress , and nurse , the despondence that sunk her little heart was severe .

Fanny Price	patient	console	The grandeur of the house astonished , but could not console her . 
Fanny Price	patient	sobbing	The rooms were too large for her to move in with ease : whatever she touched she expected to injure , and she crept about in constant terror of something or other ; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry ; and the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing - room when she left it at night as seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good fortune , ended every day ’s sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep . 
Fanny Price	patient	found	A week had passed in this way , and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet passive manner , when she was found one morning by her cousin Edmund , the youngest of the sons , sitting crying on the attic stairs . 
Fanny Price	patient	persuade	And sitting down by her , he was at great pains to overcome her shame in being so surprised , and persuade her to speak openly . 
Fanny Price	patient	get	Did she , in short , want anything he could possibly get her , or do for her ? 
Fanny Price	patient	console	He tried to console her . 
Fanny Price	patient	love	“ You are sorry to leave Mama , my dear little Fanny , ” said he , “ which shows you to be a very good girl ; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends , who all love you , and wish to make you happy . 
Fanny Price	patient	prepared	Fanny thought it a bold measure , but offered no further resistance ; and they went together into the breakfast - room , where Edmund prepared her paper , and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brother could himself have felt , and probably with somewhat more exactness . 
Fanny Price	patient	assist	He continued with her the whole time of her writing , to assist her with his penknife or his orthography , as either were wanted ; and added to these attentions , which she felt very much , a kindness to her brother which delighted her beyond all the rest .

Fanny Price	patient	taught	Fanny could read , work , and write , but she had been taught nothing more ; and as her cousins found her ignorant of many things with which they had been long familiar , they thought her prodigiously stupid , and for the first two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh report of it into the drawing - room . 
Fanny Price	patient	bring	But , all things considered , I do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so , for , though you know ( owing to me ) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you , it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are;—on the contrary , it is much more desirable that there should be a difference . 
Fanny Price	patient	fixed	Fanny , with all her faults of ignorance and timidity , was fixed at Mansfield Park , and learning to transfer in its favour much of her attachment to her former home , grew up there not unhappily among her cousins . 
Fanny Price	patient	mortified	There was no positive ill - nature in Maria or Julia ; and though Fanny was often mortified by their treatment of her , she thought too lowly of her own claims to feel injured by it . 
Fanny Price	patient	used	From about the time of her entering the family , Lady Bertram , in consequence of a little ill - health , and a great deal of indolence , gave up the house in town , which she had been used to occupy every spring , and remained wholly in the country , leaving Sir Thomas to attend his duty in Parliament , with whatever increase or diminution of comfort might arise from her absence . 
Fanny Price	patient	want	Of the rest she saw nothing : nobody seemed to think of her ever going amongst them again , even for a visit , nobody at home seemed to want her ; but William determining , soon after her removal , to be a sailor , was invited to spend a week with his sister in Northamptonshire before he went to sea . 
Fanny Price	patient	leave	Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt ’s words , “ Going to leave you ? ” 
Fanny Price	patient	take	You have been five years with us , and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died . 
Fanny Price	patient	vex	I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	persuaded	“ Cousin , ” said she , “ something is going to happen which I do not like at all ; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first , you will not be able to do it now . 
Fanny Price	patient	told	“ Yes ; my aunt Bertram has just told me so . 
Fanny Price	patient	distress	I hope it does not distress you very much , Fanny ? ” 
Fanny Price	patient	prevent	“ I can never be important to any one . ” “ What is to prevent you ? 
Fanny Price	patient	believe	“ As to your foolishness and awkwardness , my dear Fanny , believe me , you never have a shadow of either , but in using the words so improperly . 
Fanny Price	patient	known	There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known . 
Fanny Price	patient	thank	“ You are too kind , ” said Fanny , colouring at such praise ; “ how shall I ever thank you as I ought , for thinking so well of me . 
Fanny Price	patient	forced	_ Here _ there are too many whom you can hide behind ; but with _ her _ you will be forced to speak for yourself . ” “ Oh ! 
Fanny Price	patient	force	She is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about , and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers . ”

Fanny Price	patient	taking	So ended their discourse , which , for any very appropriate service it could render Fanny , might as well have been spared , for Mrs. Norris had not the smallest intention of taking her . 
Fanny Price	patient	receive	To prevent its being expected , she had fixed on the smallest habitation which could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish , the White House being only just large enough to receive herself and her servants , and allow a spare room for a friend , of which she made a very particular point .

Fanny Price	patient	save	Not all her precautions , however , could save her from being suspected of something better ; or , perhaps , her very display of the importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose it really intended for Fanny . 
Fanny Price	patient	take	He could not say he _ wished _ me to take Fanny . 
Fanny Price	patient	taking	“ Well , Lady Bertram , ” said Mrs. Norris , moving to go , “ I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ; 
Fanny Price	patient	give	besides that , I really should not have a bed to give her , for I must keep a spare room for a friend . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	charged	He had said to her , moreover , on the very last morning , that he hoped she might see William again in the course of the ensuing winter , and had charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to be in England . “ This was so thoughtful and kind ! ” and would he only have smiled upon her , and called her “ my dear Fanny , ”

Fanny Price	patient	sink	But he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification , by adding , “ If William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	seeing	She cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle was gone ; and her cousins , on seeing her with red eyes , set her down as a hypocrite . 
Fanny Price	patient	set	She cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle was gone ; and her cousins , on seeing her with red eyes , set her down as a hypocrite . 
Fanny Price	patient	situated	When he returned , to understand how Fanny was situated , and perceived its ill effects , there seemed with him but one thing to be done ; and that “ Fanny must have a horse ” was the resolute declaration with which he opposed whatever could be urged by the supineness of his mother , or the economy of his aunt , to make it appear unimportant . 
Fanny Price	patient	put	The new mare proved a treasure ; with a very little trouble she became exactly calculated for the purpose , and Fanny was then put in almost full possession of her . 
Fanny Price	patient	suit	She had not supposed before that anything could ever suit her like the old grey pony ; but her delight in Edmund ’s mare was far beyond any former pleasure of the sort ; and the addition it was ever receiving in the consideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung , was beyond all her words to express . 
Fanny Price	patient	obliged	Fanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story , but his determined silence obliged her to relate her brother ’s situation : her voice was animated in speaking of his profession , and the foreign stations he had been on ; but she could not mention the number of years that he had been absent without tears in her eyes . 
Fanny Price	patient	suspecting	Now do not be suspecting me of a pun , I entreat . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	struck	But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you , Fanny , as not quite right ? ” “ Oh yes ! 
Fanny Price	patient	struck	“ I thought you would be struck . 
Fanny Price	patient	used	I am sure William would never have used _ me _ so , under any circumstances . 
Fanny Price	patient	reminded	She was a little surprised that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford , and not see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed , and of which _ she _ was almost always reminded by a something of the same nature whenever she was in her company ; but so it was . 
Fanny Price	patient	settled	The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride , which the former caught , soon after her being settled at Mansfield , from the example of the young ladies at the Park , and which , when Edmund ’s acquaintance with her increased , led to his encouraging the wish , and the offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts , as the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish . 
Fanny Price	patient	attended	returned with it in excellent time , before either Fanny or the steady old coachman , who always attended her when she rode without her cousins , were ready to set forward . 
Fanny Price	patient	scold	Fanny was ready and waiting , and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone , and still no horse was announced , no Edmund appeared . 
Fanny Price	patient	forget	It was a sound which did not make _ her _ cheerful ; she wondered that Edmund should forget her , and felt a pang . 
Fanny Price	patient	forgotten	She began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such double duty ; if she were forgotten , the poor mare should be remembered . 
Fanny Price	patient	fatigued	I wish _ you _ may not be fatigued by so much exercise . 
Fanny Price	patient	fatigues	” “ No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse , I assure you , ” said she , as she sprang down with his help 
Fanny Price	patient	fatigues	Nothing ever fatigues me but doing what I do not like . 
Fanny Price	patient	lifted	The old coachman , who had been waiting about with his own horse , now joining them , Fanny was lifted on hers , and they set off across another part of the park ; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing , as she looked back , that the others were walking down the hill together to the village ; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments on Miss Crawford ’s great cleverness as a horse - woman , which he had been watching with an interest almost equal to her own . 
Fanny Price	patient	asked	When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ride the next day . 
Fanny Price	patient	gone	Is she gone to bed ? ” 
Fanny Price	patient	employ	Why can not you come and sit here , and employ yourself as _ we _ do ? 
Fanny Price	patient	supply	If you have no work of your own , I can supply you from the poor basket . 
Fanny Price	patient	returned	You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa . ” Before half this was said , Fanny was returned to her seat at the table , and had taken up her work again ; and Julia , who was in high good - humour , from the pleasures of the day , did her the justice of exclaiming , “ I must say , ma’am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . ” “ Fanny , ” said Edmund , after looking at her attentively , “ I am sure you have the headache . ” She could not deny it , but said it was not very bad . “ I can hardly believe you , ” he replied ; “ I know your looks too well .

Fanny Price	patient	have	to be sure she did , ” said Mrs. Norris : “ would you have her stay within such a fine day as this ? 
Fanny Price	patient	oblige	“ But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice ? ” 
Fanny Price	patient	obliged	“ No ; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry ; and , unluckily , Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key , so she was obliged to go again . 
Fanny Price	patient	obliged	Edmund said no more to either lady ; but going quietly to another table , on which the supper - tray yet remained , brought a glass of Madeira to Fanny , and obliged her to drink the greater part 
Fanny Price	patient	left	Nothing of this would have happened had she been properly considered ; but she had been left four days together without any choice of companions or exercise , and without any excuse for avoiding whatever her unreasonable aunts might require . 
Fanny Price	patient	support	As she leant on the sofa , to which she had retreated that she might not be seen , the pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head ; and the sudden change which Edmund ’s kindness had then occasioned , made her hardly know how to support herself . 
Fanny Price	patient	gone	CHAPTER VIII Fanny ’s rides recommenced the very next day ; and as it was a pleasant fresh - feeling morning , less hot than the weather had lately been , Edmund trusted that her losses , both of health and pleasure , would be soon made good . While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived , escorting his mother , who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially , in urging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton , which had been started a fortnight before , and which , in consequence of her subsequent absence from home , had since lain dormant . 
Fanny Price	patient	spare	Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her . 
Fanny Price	patient	keep	“ You can have no reason , I imagine , madam , ” said he , addressing his mother , “ for wishing Fanny _ not _ to be of the party , but as it relates to yourself , to your own comfort . If you could do without her , you would not wish to keep her at home ? ” 
Fanny Price	patient	taking	Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could remain — their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could not go , and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in taking her , which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got over . 
Fanny Price	patient	invited	She was not often invited to join in the conversation of the others , nor did she desire it . 
Fanny Price	patient	take	Having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of any other use than to contribute to the window - tax , and find employment for housemaids , “ Now , ” said Mrs. Rushworth , “ we are coming to the chapel , which properly we ought to enter from above , and look down upon ; but as we are quite among friends , I will take you in this way , if you will excuse me . 
Fanny Price	patient	prepared	Fanny ’s imagination had prepared her for something grander than a mere spacious , oblong room , fitted up for the purpose of devotion : with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion of mahogany , and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge of the family gallery above . 
Fanny Price	patient	Thank	“ Thank you , but I am not at all tired . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	attack	do not attack me with your watch . 
Fanny Price	patient	dictated	I can not be dictated to by a watch . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	rested	It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world , and Miss Price has found it so , though she did not know it . ” “ I shall soon be rested , ” said Fanny ; “ to sit in the shade on a fine day , and look upon verdure , is the most perfect refreshment . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	rested	Fanny said she was rested , and would have moved too , but this was not suffered . 
Fanny Price	patient	left	Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an earnestness which she could not resist , and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin ’s care , but with great regret that she was not stronger . 
Fanny Price	patient	satisfied	She listened , and at length she heard ; she heard voices and feet approaching ; but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those she wanted , when Miss Bertram , Mr. Rushworth , and Mr. Crawford issued from the same path which she had trod herself , and were before her . 
Fanny Price	patient	used	“ Poor dear Fanny , ” cried her cousin , “ how ill you have been used by them ! 
Fanny Price	patient	seating	Then seating herself with a gentleman on each side , she resumed the conversation which had engaged them before , and discussed the possibility of improvements with much animation . 
Fanny Price	patient	left	Fanny was again left to her solitude , and with no increase of pleasant feelings , for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard , astonished at Miss Bertram , and angry with Mr. Crawford . 
Fanny Price	patient	forget	She could almost have thought that Edmund and Miss Crawford had left it , but that it was impossible for Edmund to forget her so entirely . 
Fanny Price	patient	roused	She was again roused from disagreeable musings by sudden footsteps : somebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk . 
Fanny Price	patient	seeing	She expected Mr. Rushworth , but it was Julia , who , hot and out of breath , and with a look of disappointment , cried out on seeing her , “ Heyday ! 
Fanny Price	patient	obliged	I am not obliged to punish myself for _ her _ sins . 
Fanny Price	patient	punish	I am not obliged to punish myself for _ her _ sins . 
Fanny Price	patient	joined	He joined her within five minutes after Julia ’s exit ; and though she made the best of the story , he was evidently mortified and displeased in no common degree . 
Fanny Price	patient	silenced	This could not be denied , and Fanny was silenced . 
Fanny Price	patient	escaped	A small sigh escaped Fanny here , and she did not know how to contradict him . 
Fanny Price	patient	encouraged	Fanny thought she discerned in his standing there an indication of relenting , which encouraged her to another attempt , and she said , therefore , “ It is a pity you should not join them . 
Fanny Price	patient	left	Fanny ’s thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her so long ago , and getting quite impatient , she resolved to go in search of them . 
Fanny Price	patient	leaving	They were just returned into the wilderness from the park , to which a sidegate , not fastened , had tempted them very soon after their leaving her , and they had been across a portion of the park into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning to reach at last , and had been sitting down under one of the trees . 
Fanny Price	patient	taken	Whatever cross - accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces , she had found a morning of complete enjoyment ; for the housekeeper , after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants , had taken her to the dairy , told her all about their cows , and given her the receipt for a famous cream cheese ; and since Julia ’s leaving them they had been met by the gardener , with whom she had made a most satisfactory acquaintance , for she had set him right as to his grandson ’s illness , convinced him that it was an ague , and promised him a charm for it ; and he , in return , had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants , and actually presented her with a very curious specimen of heath .

Fanny Price	patient	obliged	I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go . 
Fanny Price	patient	asked	joining them the moment she is asked . 
Fanny Price	patient	taught	“ _ You _ taught me to think and feel on the subject , cousin . ” “ I had a very apt scholar . 
Fanny Price	patient	mistaken	” Fanny supposed she must have been mistaken , and meant to think differently in future ; but with all that submission to Edmund could do , and all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she occasionally noticed in some of the others , and which seemed to say that Julia was Mr. Crawford ’s choice , she knew not always what to think . 
Fanny Price	patient	asking	He came towards their little circle ; but instead of asking her to dance , drew a chair near her , and gave her an account of the present state of a sick horse , and the opinion of the groom , from whom he had just parted . 
Fanny Price	patient	led	Fanny was led off very willingly , though it was impossible for her to feel much gratitude towards her cousin , or distinguish , as he certainly did , between the selfishness of another person and his own . 
Fanny Price	patient	tempt	I can stand it no longer , and I think , I may say , that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again ; but one good thing I have just ascertained : it is the very room for a theatre , precisely the shape and length for it ; and the doors at the farther end , communicating with each other , as they may be made to do in five minutes , by merely moving the bookcase in my father ’s room , is the very thing we could have desired , if we had sat down to wish for it ; and my father ’s room will be an excellent greenroom . 
Fanny Price	patient	preventing	“ I am convinced , madam , ” said Edmund , preventing Fanny , “ that Sir Thomas would not like it . ” “ There , my dear , do you hear what Edmund says ? ” “ If I were to decline the part , ” said Maria , with renewed zeal , “ Julia would certainly take it . ” “ What ! ” cried Edmund , “ if she knew your reasons ! ” 
Fanny Price	patient	employing	Fanny was up in a moment , expecting some errand ; for the habit of employing her in that way was not yet overcome , in spite of all that Edmund could do . 
Fanny Price	patient	disturb	we do not want to disturb you from your seat . 
Fanny Price	patient	want	We shall only want you in our play . 
Fanny Price	patient	excuse	“ Indeed you must excuse me . 
Fanny Price	patient	excuse	“ Indeed , but you must , for we can not excuse you . 
Fanny Price	patient	frighten	It need not frighten you : it is a nothing of a part , a mere nothing , not above half a dozen speeches altogether , and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say ; so you may be as creep - mouse as you like , but we must have you to look at . ” “ If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches , ” cried Mr. Rushworth , “ what would you do with such a part as mine ?

Fanny Price	patient	put	You have only two scenes , and as I shall be Cottager , I ’ll put you in and push you about , and you will do it very well , I ’ll answer for it . 
Fanny Price	patient	push	You have only two scenes , and as I shall be Cottager , I ’ll put you in and push you about , and you will do it very well , I ’ll answer for it . 
Fanny Price	patient	excuse	“ No , indeed , Mr. Bertram , you must excuse me . 
Fanny Price	patient	excuse	” “ You must excuse me , indeed you must excuse me , ” cried Fanny , growing more and more red from excessive agitation , and looking distressfully at Edmund , who was kindly observing her ; but unwilling to exasperate his brother by interference , gave her only an encouraging smile . 
Fanny Price	patient	excuse	” “ You must excuse me , indeed you must excuse me , ” cried Fanny , growing more and more red from excessive agitation , and looking distressfully at Edmund , who was kindly observing her ; but unwilling to exasperate his brother by interference , gave her only an encouraging smile . 
Fanny Price	patient	observing	” “ You must excuse me , indeed you must excuse me , ” cried Fanny , growing more and more red from excessive agitation , and looking distressfully at Edmund , who was kindly observing her ; but unwilling to exasperate his brother by interference , gave her only an encouraging smile . 
Fanny Price	patient	addressing	Her entreaty had no effect on Tom : he only said again what he had said before ; and it was not merely Tom , for the requisition was now backed by Maria , and Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Yates , with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious , and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny ; and before she could breathe after it , Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you ! 
Fanny Price	patient	urge	“ Do not urge her , madam , ” said Edmund . 
Fanny Price	patient	urge	“ It is not fair to urge her in this manner . 
Fanny Price	patient	urge	Do not urge her any more . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	urge	“ I am not going to urge her , ” replied Mrs. Norris sharply ; “ but I shall think her a very obstinate , ungrateful girl , if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her — very ungrateful , indeed , considering who and what she is . 
Fanny Price	patient	wish	“ I am not going to urge her , ” replied Mrs. Norris sharply ; “ but I shall think her a very obstinate , ungrateful girl , if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her — very ungrateful , indeed , considering who and what she is . 
Fanny Price	patient	governed	By a look at her brother she prevented any farther entreaty from the theatrical board , and the really good feelings by which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to all the little she had lost in Edmund ’s favour . 
Fanny Price	patient	restoring	By a look at her brother she prevented any farther entreaty from the theatrical board , and the really good feelings by which she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to all the little she had lost in Edmund ’s favour . 
Fanny Price	patient	advised	and when , from taking notice of her work , and wishing _ she _ could work as well , and begging for the pattern , and supposing Fanny was now preparing for her _ appearance _ , as of course she would come out when her cousin was married , Miss Crawford proceeded to inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea , and said that she had quite a curiosity to see him , and imagined him a very fine young man , and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea again — she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery , or help listening , and answering with more animation than she had intended . 
Fanny Price	patient	telling	The consultation upon the play still went on , and Miss Crawford ’s attention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram ’s telling her , with infinite regret , that he found it absolutely impossible for him to undertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler : he had been most anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible , but it would not do ; he must give it up . 
Fanny Price	patient	talk	It was not in Miss Crawford ’s power to talk Fanny into any real forgetfulness of what had passed . 
Fanny Price	patient	protected	Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time ; and if she were applied to again among themselves with all the authoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of , and Edmund perhaps away , what should she do ? 
Fanny Price	patient	applied	Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time ; and if she were applied to again among themselves with all the authoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of , and Edmund perhaps away , what should she do ? 
Fanny Price	patient	continued	The little white attic , which had continued her sleeping - room ever since her first entering the family , proving incompetent to suggest any reply , she had recourse , as soon as she was dressed , to another apartment more spacious and more meet for walking about in and thinking , and of which she had now for some time been almost equally mistress . 
Fanny Price	patient	oppose	The room had then become useless , and for some time was quite deserted , except by Fanny , when she visited her plants , or wanted one of the books , which she was still glad to keep there , from the deficiency of space and accommodation in her little chamber above : but gradually , as her value for the comforts of it increased , she had added to her possessions , and spent more of her time there ; and having nothing to oppose her , had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it , that it was now generally admitted to be hers .

Fanny Price	patient	told	what was yet more frequent or more dear , Edmund had been her champion and her friend : he had supported her cause or explained her meaning , he had told her not to cry , or had given her some proof of affection which made her tears delightful ; and the whole was now so blended together , so harmonised by distance , that every former affliction had its charm . The room was most dear to her , and she would not have changed its furniture for the handsomest in the house , though what had been originally plain had suffered all the ill - usage of children ; and its greatest elegancies and ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia ’s work , too ill done for the drawing - room , three transparencies , made in a rage for transparencies , for the three lower panes of one window , where Tintern Abbey held its station between a cave in Italy and a moonlight lake in Cumberland , a collection of family profiles , thought unworthy of being anywhere else , over the mantelpiece , and by their side , and pinned against the wall , a small sketch of a ship sent four years ago from the Mediterranean by William , with H.M.S. Antwerp at the bottom , in letters as tall as the mainmast . 
Fanny Price	patient	exposing	Was she _ right _ in refusing what was so warmly asked , so strongly wished for — what might be so essential to a scheme on which some of those to whom she owed the greatest complaisance had set their hearts ? Was it not ill - nature , selfishness , and a fear of exposing herself ? 
Fanny Price	patient	justify	And would Edmund ’s judgment , would his persuasion of Sir Thomas ’s disapprobation of the whole , be enough to justify her in a determined denial in spite of all the rest ? 
Fanny Price	patient	inclined	It would be so horrible to her to act that she was inclined to suspect the truth and purity of her own scruples ; and as she looked around her , the claims of her cousins to being obliged were strengthened by the sight of present upon present that she had received from them . 
Fanny Price	patient	given	The table between the windows was covered with work - boxes and netting - boxes which had been given her at different times , principally by Tom ; and she grew bewildered as to the amount of the debt which all these kind remembrances produced . 
Fanny Price	patient	roused	A tap at the door roused her in the midst of this attempt to find her way to her duty , and her gentle “ Come in ” was answered by the appearance of one , before whom all her doubts were wo nt to be laid . 
Fanny Price	patient	gratified	“ My opinion ! ” she cried , shrinking from such a compliment , highly as it gratified her . “ Yes , your advice and opinion . 
Fanny Price	patient	stopt	Her conscience stopt her in 
Fanny Price	patient	interrupt	And now , dear Fanny , I will not interrupt you any longer . 
Fanny Price	patient	relieve	“ And here are Crabbe ’s Tales , and the Idler , at hand to relieve you , if you tire of your great book . 
Fanny Price	patient	distressed	The doubts and alarms as to her own conduct , which had previously distressed her , and which had all slept while she listened to him , were become of little consequence now . 
Fanny Price	patient	tease	Her cousins might attack , but could hardly tease her . 
Fanny Price	patient	persuade	Perhaps you may persuade _ her _ . ” “ No , she is quite determined . 
Fanny Price	patient	felt	And not another word was said ; but Fanny felt herself again in danger , and her indifference to the danger was beginning to fail her already . 
Fanny Price	patient	fail	And not another word was said ; but Fanny felt herself again in danger , and her indifference to the danger was beginning to fail her already . 
Fanny Price	patient	wanted	One advantage resulted from it to Fanny : at the earnest request of Miss Crawford , Mrs. Grant had , with her usual good - humour , agreed to undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted ; and this was all that occurred to gladden _ her _ heart during the day ; and even this , when imparted by Edmund , brought a pang with it , for it was Miss 
Fanny Price	patient	obliged	Crawford to whom she was obliged — it was Miss Crawford whose kind exertions were to excite her gratitude , and whose merit in making them was spoken of with a glow of admiration . 
Fanny Price	patient	shewed	But reflection brought better feelings , and shewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect , which could never have belonged to _ her _ ; and that , had she received even the greatest , she could never have been easy in joining a scheme which , considering only her uncle , she must condemn altogether . 
Fanny Price	patient	want	There was a great deal of needlework to be done , moreover , in which her help was wanted ; and that Mrs. Norris thought her quite as well off as the rest , was evident by the manner in which she claimed it—“Come , Fanny , ” she cried , “ these are fine times for you , but you must not be always walking from one room to the other , and doing the lookings - on at your ease , in this way ; I want you here . 
Fanny Price	patient	tell	_ You _ are best off , I can tell you : but if nobody did more than _ you _ , we should not get on very fast . ” Fanny took the work very quietly , without attempting any defence ; but her kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf — “ One can not wonder , sister , that Fanny _ should _ be delighted : it is all new to her , you know ; you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves , and so am I still ; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure , _ I _ mean to look in at their rehearsals too .

Fanny Price	patient	ask	“ Oh ! sister , pray do not ask her now ; for Fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time . 
Fanny Price	patient	interested	Fanny did not share her aunt ’s composure : she thought of the morrow a great deal , for if the three acts were rehearsed , Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be acting together for the first time ; the third act would bring a scene between them which interested her most particularly , and which she was longing and dreading to see how they would perform . 
Fanny Price	patient	shew	Fanny , quite surprised , endeavoured to shew herself mistress of the room by her civilities , and looked at the bright bars of her empty grate with concern . 
Fanny Price	patient	hardened	I came here to - day intending to rehearse it with Edmund — by ourselves — against the evening , but he is not in the way ; and if he _ were _ , I do not think I could go through it with _ him _ , till I have hardened myself a little ; for really there is a speech or two . 
Fanny Price	patient	seeking	He too had his book , and was seeking Fanny , to ask her to rehearse with him , and help him to prepare for the evening , without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the house ; and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together , of comparing schemes , and sympathising in praise of Fanny ’s kind offices .

Fanny Price	patient	invested	She was invested , indeed , with the office of judge and critic , and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them all their faults ; but from doing so every feeling within her shrank — she could not , would not , dared not attempt it : had she been otherwise qualified for criticism , her conscience must have restrained her from venturing at disapprobation .

Fanny Price	patient	forgot	In watching them she forgot herself ; and , agitated by the increasing spirit of Edmund ’s manner , had once closed the page and turned away 
Fanny Price	patient	forced	At last the scene was over , and Fanny forced herself to add her praise to the compliments each was giving the other ; and when again alone and able to recall the whole , she was inclined to believe their performance would , indeed , have such nature and feeling in it as must ensure their credit , and make it a very suffering exhibition to herself .

Fanny Price	patient	distress	She had known it would irritate and distress her ; she had known it her duty to keep away . 
Fanny Price	patient	left	Everybody was satisfied ; and she was left to the tremors of a most palpitating heart , while the others prepared to begin . 
Fanny Price	patient	left	were no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer the anxious inquiry , and , encouraging him by all means to pay his respects to Sir Thomas without delay , sent him after the others with delighted haste . Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates . 
Fanny Price	patient	classing	on Sir Thomas ’s affection was much too humble to give her any idea of classing herself with his children , she was glad to remain behind and gain a little breathing - time . 
Fanny Price	patient	collect	” Fanny was just beginning to collect herself , and to feel that if she staid longer behind it might seem disrespectful , when this point was settled , and being commissioned with the brother and sister ’s apology , saw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself to perform the dreadful duty of appearing before her uncle . 
Fanny Price	patient	find	Too soon did she find herself at the drawing - room door ; and after pausing a moment for what she knew would not come , for a courage which the outside of no door had ever supplied to her , she turned the lock in desperation , and the lights of the drawing - room , and all the collected family , were before her . 
Fanny Price	patient	perceiving	Why do not I see my little Fanny?”—and on perceiving her , came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her , calling her his dear Fanny , kissing her affectionately , and observing with decided pleasure how much she was grown !

Fanny Price	patient	led	He led her nearer the light and looked at her again — inquired particularly after her health , and then , correcting himself , observed that he need not inquire , 
Fanny Price	patient	reproach	He inquired next after her family , especially William : and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little , and thinking his return a misfortune ; and when , on having courage to lift her eyes to his face , she saw that he was grown thinner , and had the burnt , fagged , worn look of fatigue and a hot climate , every tender feeling was increased , and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him . 
Fanny Price	patient	entertains	It entertains _ me _ more than many other things have done ; but then I am unlike other people , I dare say . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	satisfy	He will satisfy you . 
Fanny Price	patient	embarrassed	though they may be chiefly on your person , you must put up with it , and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time . ” Such language was so new to Fanny that it quite embarrassed her . “ Your uncle thinks you very pretty , dear Fanny — and that is the long and the short of the matter .

Fanny Price	patient	harden	You must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at . 
Fanny Price	patient	set	And while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word , or seeming at all interested in the subject , I did not like — I thought it would appear as if I wanted to set myself off at their expense , by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel . ”

Fanny Price	patient	wanted	Fanny ’s consequence increased on the departure of her cousins . Becoming , as she then did , the only young woman in the drawing - room , the only occupier of that interesting division of a family in which she had hitherto held so humble a third , it was impossible for her not to be more looked at , more thought of and attended to , than she had ever been before ; and “ Where is Fanny ? ” became no uncommon question , even without her being wanted for any one ’s convenience . Not only at home did her value increase , but at the Parsonage too . 
Fanny Price	patient	providing	She was all alive again directly , and among the most active in being useful to Fanny , in detecting her to be wetter than she would at first allow , and providing her with dry clothes ; and Fanny , after being obliged to submit to all this attention , and to being assisted and waited on by mistresses and maids , being also obliged , on returning downstairs , to be fixed in their drawing - room for an hour while the rain continued , the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was thus extended to Miss Crawford , and might carry on her spirits to the period of dressing and dinner . 
Fanny Price	patient	believed	The two sisters were so kind to her , and so pleasant , that Fanny might have enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way , and could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at the end of the hour , and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant ’s carriage and horses out to take her home , with which she was threatened . As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather might occasion at home , she had nothing to suffer on that score ; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts , she was perfectly aware that none would be felt , and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain , her being in such cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram .

Fanny Price	patient	asked	You must stay and hear your cousin ’s favourite . ” Fanny felt that she must ; and though she had not waited for that sentence to be thinking of Edmund , such a memento made her particularly awake to his idea , and she fancied him sitting in that room again and again , perhaps in the very spot where she sat now , listening with constant delight to the favourite air , played , as it appeared to her , with superior tone and expression ; and though pleased with it herself , and glad to like whatever was liked by him , she was more sincerely impatient to go away at the conclusion of it than she had been before ; and on this being evident , she was so kindly asked to call again , to take them in her walk whenever she could , to come and hear more of the harp , that she felt it necessary to be done , if no objection arose at home . 
Fanny Price	patient	loving	Fanny went to her every two or three days : it seemed a kind of fascination : she could not be easy without going , and yet it was without loving her , without ever thinking like her , without any sense of obligation for being sought after now when nobody else was to be had ; and deriving no higher pleasure from her conversation than occasional amusement , and _ that _ often at the expense of her judgment , when it was raised by pleasantry on people or subjects which she wished to be respected . 
Fanny Price	patient	struck	“ This is pretty , very pretty , ” said Fanny , looking around her as they were thus sitting together one day ; “ every time I come into this shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty . 
Fanny Price	patient	consider	A friendship between two so very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished : and to the credit of the lover ’s understanding , be it stated , that he did not by any means consider Fanny as the only , or even as the greater gainer by such a friendship . 
Fanny Price	patient	accompanied	the general pace was quickened , and they all accompanied her into the house , through which it was necessary to pass . 
Fanny Price	patient	sparing	But Edmund , delighted with her having such an happiness offered , and ascertaining with half a look , and half a sentence , that she had no objection but on her aunt ’s account , could not imagine that his mother would make any difficulty of sparing her , and therefore gave his decided open advice that the invitation should be accepted ; and though Fanny would not venture , even on his encouragement , to such a flight of audacious independence , it was soon settled , that if nothing were heard to the contrary , Mrs. Grant might expect her .

Fanny Price	patient	ask	CHAPTER XXIII “ But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny 
Fanny Price	patient	asking	“ How came she to think of asking Fanny ? 
Fanny Price	patient	spare	I can not spare her , and I am sure she does not want to go . 
Fanny Price	patient	asking	“ I can not imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her ? 
Fanny Price	patient	asked	She used to ask your sisters now and then , but she never asked Fanny . 
Fanny Price	patient	ask	But he will be very much surprised that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all . 
Fanny Price	patient	asked	Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner . 
Fanny Price	patient	spare	But how can I spare her ? ” 
Fanny Price	patient	ask	He told the whole ; and she had only to add , “ So strange ! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her . ” “ But is it not very natural , ” observed Edmund , “ that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? ” “ Nothing can be more natural , ” said Sir Thomas , after a short deliberation ; “ nor , were there no sister in the case , could anything , in my opinion , be more natural . 
Fanny Price	patient	denied	But as I conclude that she must wish to go , since all young people like to be together , I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence . ” “ But can I do without her , Sir Thomas ? ” “ Indeed I think you may . ” “ She always makes tea , you know , when my sister is not here . ” “ Your sister , perhaps , may be prevailed on to spend the day with us , and I shall certainly be at home . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	pain	for am I not certain of seeing or hearing something there to pain me ? ” 
Fanny Price	patient	had	Simple as such an engagement might appear in other eyes , it had novelty and importance in hers , for excepting the day at Sotherton , she had scarcely ever dined out before ; and though now going only half a mile , and only to three people , still it was dining out , and all the little interests of preparation were enjoyments in themselves . 
Fanny Price	patient	asked	Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to _ us _ to take a little notice of you , or else it would never have come into her head , and you may be very certain that , if your cousin Julia had been at home , you would not have been asked at all . 
Fanny Price	patient	entreat	Mrs. Norris fetched breath , and went on again . “ The nonsense and folly of people ’s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves , makes me think it right to give _ you _ a hint , Fanny , now that you are going into company without any of us ; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward , and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins — as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia . 
Fanny Price	patient	putting	Mrs. Norris fetched breath , and went on again . “ The nonsense and folly of people ’s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves , makes me think it right to give _ you _ a hint , Fanny , now that you are going into company without any of us ; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward , and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins — as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia . 
Fanny Price	patient	cost	She felt that the carriage was for herself , and herself alone : and her uncle ’s consideration of her , coming immediately after such representations from her aunt , cost her some tears of gratitude when she was alone . 
Fanny Price	patient	tell	“ Now I must look at you , Fanny , ” said Edmund , with the kind smile of an affectionate brother , “ and tell you how I like you ; and as well as I can judge by this light , you look very nicely indeed . 
Fanny Price	patient	like	“ Now I must look at you , Fanny , ” said Edmund , with the kind smile of an affectionate brother , “ and tell you how I like you ; and as well as I can judge by this light , you look very nicely indeed . 
Fanny Price	patient	observe	” There was no occasion , there was no time for Fanny to say how very differently she felt ; but the idea of having such another to observe her was a great increase of the trepidation with which she performed the very awful ceremony of walking into the drawing - room . 
Fanny Price	patient	required	while they were at table , such a happy flow of conversation prevailing , in which she was not required to take any part — there was so much to be said between the brother and sister about Bath , so much between the two young men about hunting , so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and Dr. Grant , and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawford and Mrs. Grant , as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to listen in quiet , and of passing a very agreeable day . 
Fanny Price	patient	addressing	And then changing his tone again to one of gentle gallantry , and addressing Fanny , he said , “ You were Mr. Rushworth ’s best friend . 
Fanny Price	patient	concerned	I think , Miss Price , we would have indulged ourselves with a week ’s calm in the Atlantic at that season . ” He seemed determined to be answered ; and Fanny , averting her face , said , with a firmer tone than usual , “ As far as _ I _ am concerned , sir , I would not have delayed his return for a day . 
Fanny Price	patient	engaged	And then turning the conversation , he would have engaged her on some other subject , but her answers were so shy and reluctant that he could not advance in any . 
Fanny Price	patient	see	You see her every day , and therefore do not notice it ; but I assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn . 
Fanny Price	patient	grown	She must be grown two inches , at least , since October . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	compare	This is only because there were no tall women to compare her with , and because she has got a new gown , and you never saw her so well dressed before . 
Fanny Price	patient	understand	I do not understand her . 
Fanny Price	patient	entertain	I never was so long in company with a girl in my life , trying to entertain her , and succeed so ill ! 
Fanny Price	patient	plunge	I do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy ; a _ little _ love , perhaps , may animate and do her good , but I will not have you plunge her deep , for she is as good a little creature as ever lived , and has a great deal of feeling . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	kill	“ It can be but for a fortnight , ” said Henry ; “ and if a fortnight can kill her , she must have a constitution which nothing could save . 
Fanny Price	patient	reconciled	that he could relate of his own horsemanship in various countries , of the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged , the rough horses and mules he had ridden , or his many narrow escapes from dreadful falls , that he was at all equal to the management of a high - fed hunter in an English fox - chase ; nor till he returned safe and well , without accident or discredit , could she be reconciled to the risk , or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the horse which he had fully intended it should produce . 
Fanny Price	patient	feel	It was a fine arrangement for Henry Crawford , who was close to Fanny , and with his hands full of business , having two persons ’ cards to manage as well as his own ; for though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself mistress of the rules of the game in three minutes , he had yet to inspirit her play , sharpen her avarice , and harden her heart , 
Fanny Price	patient	cheat	“ Poor Fanny ! not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes ! ” 
Fanny Price	patient	have	I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of dancing too , when I can not have you . 
Fanny Price	patient	sink	Some very grave reproof , or at least the coldest expression of indifference , must be coming to distress her brother , and sink her to the ground . 
Fanny Price	patient	acquits	I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a little girl ; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her , which , perhaps , we may have an opportunity of doing ere long . ”

Fanny Price	patient	satisfy	Thursday was the day of the ball ; and on Wednesday morning Fanny , still unable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear , determined to seek the counsel of the more enlightened , and apply to Mrs. Grant and her sister , whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her blameless ;

Fanny Price	patient	suit	It was just the plan to suit Fanny ; and with a great deal of gratitude on her side for such ready and kind attention , they proceeded indoors , and upstairs , and were soon deep in the interesting subject . 
Fanny Price	patient	accused	found herself obliged to yield , that she might not be accused of pride or indifference , or some other littleness ; and having with modest reluctance given her consent , proceeded to make the selection . 
Fanny Price	patient	obliged	She would rather , perhaps , have been obliged to some other person . 
Fanny Price	patient	believing	“ Well , then , ” replied Miss Crawford more seriously , but without at all believing her , “ to convince me that you suspect no trick , and are as unsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you , take the necklace and say no more about it . 
Fanny Price	patient	satisfied	Fanny dared not make any farther opposition ; and with renewed but less happy thanks accepted the necklace again , for there was an expression in Miss Crawford ’s eyes which she could not be satisfied with . 
Fanny Price	patient	please	He evidently tried to please her : he was gallant , he was attentive , he was something like what he had been to her cousins : he wanted , she supposed , to cheat her of her tranquillity as he had cheated them ; and whether he might not have some concern in this necklace — she could not be convinced that he had not , for Miss Crawford , complaisant as a sister , was careless as a woman and a friend .

Fanny Price	patient	meeting	“ Fanny , ” said he directly , leaving his seat and his pen , and meeting her with something in his hand , “ I beg your pardon for being here . 
Fanny Price	patient	Believe	Believe me , I have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours . 
Fanny Price	patient	obliged	Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour without saying another word ; but Edmund , after waiting a moment , obliged her to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying , “ But what is it that you want to consult me about ? 
Fanny Price	patient	mortifying	mortifying her severely . 
Fanny Price	patient	shewn	Why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of ? ” 
Fanny Price	patient	prevented	“ She must not suppose it not wanted , not acceptable , at least : and its having been originally her brother ’s gift makes no difference ; for as she was not prevented from offering , nor you from taking it on that account , it ought not to prevent you from keeping it . 
Fanny Price	patient	entitled	Miss Crawford ’s attentions to you have been — not more than you were justly entitled to — I am the last person to think that _ could _ _ be _ , but they have been invariable ; and to be returning them with what must have something the _ air _ of ingratitude , though I know it could never have the _ meaning _ , is not in your nature , I am sure . 
Fanny Price	patient	engaged	Wear the necklace , as you are engaged to do , to - morrow evening , and let the chain , which was not ordered with any reference to the ball , be kept for commoner occasions . 
Fanny Price	patient	tranquillise	He was gone as he spoke ; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself as she could . 
Fanny Price	patient	support	She was one of his two dearest — that must support her . 
Fanny Price	patient	obliged	It was a stab , in spite of every long - standing expectation ; and she was obliged to repeat again and again , that she was one of his two dearest , before the words gave her any sensation . 
Fanny Price	patient	do	She would endeavour to be rational , and to deserve the right of judging of Miss Crawford ’s character , and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound intellect and an honest heart . She had all the heroism of principle , and was determined to do her duty ; but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature , let her not be much wondered at , if , after making all these good resolutions on the side of self - government , she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund had begun writing to her , as a treasure beyond all her hopes , and reading with the tenderest emotion these words , “ My very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept ” locked it up with the chain , as the dearest part of the gift . 
Fanny Price	patient	rob	The proposal was a very pleasant one to William himself , who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses , and such a good - humoured , agreeable friend ; and , in likening it to going up with despatches , was saying at once everything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination could suggest ; and Fanny , from a different motive , was exceedingly pleased ; for the original plan was that William should go up by the mail from Northampton the following night , which would not have allowed him an hour ’s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach ; and though this offer of Mr. Crawford ’s would rob her of many hours of his company , she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of such a journey , to think of anything else . 
Fanny Price	patient	worn	Edmund , she had too much reason to suppose , was at the Parsonage ; and left alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris , who was cross because the housekeeper would have her own way with the supper , and whom _ she _ could not avoid though the housekeeper might , Fanny was worn down at last to think everything an evil belonging to the ball , and when sent off with a parting worry to dress , moved as languidly towards her own room , and felt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no share in it .

Fanny Price	patient	turned	And he looked so conscious , that Fanny could think but of one errand , which turned her too sick for speech . 
Fanny Price	patient	brought	“ I wished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances , ” was the explanation that followed , and brought Fanny to life again , enabling her , as she found she was expected to speak , to utter something like an inquiry as to the result .

Fanny Price	patient	stopping	But , Fanny , ” stopping her , by taking her hand , and speaking low and seriously , “ you know what all this means .

Fanny Price	patient	grieves	She does not _ think _ evil , but she speaks it , speaks it in playfulness ; and though I know it to be playfulness , it grieves me to the soul . 
Fanny Price	patient	want	Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment , and therefore , after a moment ’s consideration , said , “ If you only want me as a listener , cousin , I will be as useful as I can ; but I am not qualified for an adviser . 
Fanny Price	patient	convinced	He had said enough to give Fanny some happier feelings than she had lately known , and with a brighter look , she answered , “ Yes , cousin , I am convinced that _ you _ would be incapable of anything else , though perhaps some might not . 
Fanny Price	patient	Tell	Tell me whatever you like . 
Fanny Price	patient	recollected	Her aunt Bertram had recollected her on this occasion with an unusual degree of wakefulness . 
Fanny Price	patient	assist	It had really occurred to her , unprompted , that Fanny , preparing for a ball , might be glad of better help than the upper housemaid ’s , and when dressed herself , she actually sent her own maid to assist her ; too late , of course , to be of any use . 
Fanny Price	patient	giving	think , my dear Sir Thomas , what extraordinary advantages you and I have been the means of giving her . 
Fanny Price	patient	taken	What would she have been if we had not taken her by the hand ? 
Fanny Price	patient	made	From a variety of causes she was happy , and she was soon made still happier ; for 
Fanny Price	patient	threw	When the carriages were really heard , when the guests began really to assemble , her own gaiety of heart was much subdued : the sight of so many strangers threw her back into herself ; and besides the gravity and formality of the first great circle , which the manners of neither Sir Thomas nor Lady Bertram were of a kind to do away , she found herself occasionally called on to endure something worse . 
Fanny Price	patient	introduced	She was introduced here and there by her uncle , and forced to be spoken to , and to curtsey , and speak again . 
Fanny Price	patient	kept	Fanny felt the advantage ; and , drawing back from the toils of civility , would have been again most happy , could she have kept her eyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford . 
Fanny Price	patient	engaging	brought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her , and her thoughts were put into another channel by his engaging her almost instantly for the first two dances . 
Fanny Price	patient	asked	To be secure of a partner at first was a most essential good — for the moment of beginning was now growing seriously near ; and she so little understood her own claims as to think that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her , she must have been the last to be sought after , and should have received a partner only through a series of inquiry , and bustle , and interference , which would have been terrible ; but at the same time there was a pointedness in his manner of asking her which she did not like , and she saw his eye glancing for a moment at her necklace , with a smile — she thought there was a smile — which made her blush and feel wretched .

Fanny Price	patient	disturb	And though there was no second glance to disturb her , though his object seemed then to be only quietly agreeable , she could not get the better of her embarrassment , heightened as it was by the idea of his perceiving it , and had no composure till he turned away to some one else . 
Fanny Price	patient	found	Then she could gradually rise up to the genuine satisfaction of having a partner , a voluntary partner , secured against the dancing began . When the company were moving into the ballroom , she found herself for the first time near Miss Crawford , whose eyes and smiles were immediately and more unequivocally directed as her brother ’s had been , and who was beginning to speak on the subject , when Fanny , anxious to get the story over , hastened to give the explanation of the second necklace : the real chain . 
Fanny Price	patient	engaged	In a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her , and asked if she were engaged ; and the “ Yes , sir ; to Mr. Crawford , ” was exactly what he had intended to hear . 
Fanny Price	patient	encourage	; in vain , however : Sir Thomas smiled , tried to encourage her , and then looked too serious , and said too decidedly , “ It must be so , my dear , ” for her to hazard another word ; and she found herself the next moment conducted by Mr. Crawford to the top of the room , and standing there to be joined by the rest of the dancers , couple after couple , as they were formed . She could hardly believe it . 
Fanny Price	patient	treating	It was treating her like her cousins ! 
Fanny Price	patient	praise	Young , pretty , and gentle , however , she had no awkwardnesses that were not as good as graces , and there were few persons present that were not disposed to praise her . 
Fanny Price	patient	said	She was attractive , she was modest , she was Sir Thomas ’s niece , and she was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford . 
Fanny Price	patient	recommending	Sir Thomas himself was watching her progress down the dance with much complacency ; he was proud of his niece ; and without attributing all her personal beauty , as Mrs. Norris seemed to do , to her transplantation to Mansfield , he was pleased with himself for having supplied everything else : education and manners she owed to him . Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas ’s thoughts as he stood , and having , in spite of all his wrongs towards her , a general prevailing desire of recommending herself to him , took an opportunity of stepping aside to say something agreeable of Fanny . 
Fanny Price	patient	perceiving	to greater advantage on the subject than his lady did soon afterwards , when Mary , perceiving her on a sofa very near , turned round before she began to dance , to compliment her on Miss Price ’s looks .

Fanny Price	patient	helped	“ Yes , she does look very well , ” was Lady Bertram ’s placid reply . “ Chapman helped her to dress . 
Fanny Price	patient	paid	Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _ her _ by commendation of Fanny ; to her , it was as the occasion offered—“Ah ! ma’am , how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to - night ! ” and Mrs. Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had time for , amid so much occupation as she found for herself in making up card - tables , giving hints to Sir Thomas , and trying to move all the chaperons to a better part of the room . 
Fanny Price	patient	filling	She meant to be giving her little heart a happy flutter , and filling her with sensations of delightful self - consequence ; and , misinterpreting Fanny ’s blushes , still thought she must be doing so when she went to her after the two first dances , and said , with a significant look , “ Perhaps _ you _ can tell me why my brother goes to town to - morrow ?

Fanny Price	patient	asked	She would much rather _ not _ have been asked by him again so very soon , and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that his previous inquiries of Mrs. Norris , about the supper hour , were all for the sake of securing her at that part of the evening .

Fanny Price	patient	advising	Shortly afterward , Sir Thomas was again interfering a little with her inclination , by advising her to go immediately to bed . 
Fanny Price	patient	left	After seeing William to the last moment , Fanny walked back to the breakfast - room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy change ; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace , conceiving , perhaps , that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her tender enthusiasm , and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in William ’s plate might but divide 
Fanny Price	patient	reproaching	Fanny ’s disposition was such that she could never even think of her aunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own small house , without reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her when they had been last together ; much less could her feelings acquit her of having done and said and thought everything by William that was due to him for a whole fortnight . It was a heavy , melancholy day . 
Fanny Price	patient	took	Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm “ Yes ” ; and at the end of a quarter of an hour ’s silent consideration spontaneously observed , “ Sir Thomas , I have been thinking — and I am very glad we took Fanny 
Fanny Price	patient	shew	Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding , “ Very true . We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face , she is now a very valuable companion .

Fanny Price	patient	have	“ Yes , ” said Lady Bertram presently ; “ and it is a comfort to think that we shall always have _ her _ . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	invite	Who should invite her ? 
Fanny Price	patient	see	Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her . 
Fanny Price	patient	asking	Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her . 
Fanny Price	patient	had	The first half - hour was lost , for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together , and unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope for nothing . 
Fanny Price	patient	bring	Now Fanny could not bring herself to speak , and Miss Crawford was disappointed ; for she had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of her power from one who she thought must know , and her spirits were clouded again . 
Fanny Price	patient	marry	No : you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price . ” The surprise was now complete ; for , in spite of whatever his consciousness might suggest , a suspicion of his having any such views had never entered his sister ’s imagination ; and she looked so truly the astonishment she felt , that he was obliged to repeat what he had said , and more fully and more solemnly . 
Fanny Price	patient	known	“ When Fanny is known to him , ” continued Henry , “ he will doat on her . 
Fanny Price	patient	see	To see her with her brother ! 
Fanny Price	patient	convinced	“ The more I think of it , ” she cried , “ the more am I convinced that you are doing quite right ; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you , I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy . 
Fanny Price	patient	selected	“ The more I think of it , ” she cried , “ the more am I convinced that you are doing quite right ; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you , I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy .

Fanny Price	patient	know	“ It was bad , very bad in me against such a creature ; but I did not know her then ; and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put it into my head . 
Fanny Price	patient	take	I will not take her from Northamptonshire . 
Fanny Price	patient	prejudice	You must not prejudice Fanny against him . 
Fanny Price	patient	love	The impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make Fanny Price happy , or of ceasing to love Fanny Price , was of course the groundwork of his eloquent answer . 
Fanny Price	patient	seen	“ Had you seen her this morning , Mary , ” he continued , “ attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt ’s stupidity , working with her , and for her , her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work , then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman ’s service , and all this with such unpretending gentleness , so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command , her hair arranged as neatly as it always is , and one little curl falling forward as she wrote , which she now and then shook back , and in the midst of all this , still speaking at intervals to _ me _ , or listening , and as if she liked to listen , to what I said .

Fanny Price	patient	seen	Had you seen her so , Mary , you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	seeing	Henry , overjoyed to have her go , bowed and watched her off , and without losing another moment , turned instantly to Fanny , and , taking out some letters , said , with a most animated look , “ I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone : I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea . Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are , I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring . 
Fanny Price	patient	congratulating	I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother ’s promotion . 
Fanny Price	patient	told	, he could not have borne any participation of his feelings , but this had been his business ; and he spoke with such a glow of what his solicitude had been , and used such strong expressions , was so abounding in the _ deepest _ _ interest _ , in _ twofold _ _ motives _ , in _ views _ _ and _ _ wishes _ _ more _ _ than _ _ could _ _ be _ _ told _ , that Fanny could not have remained insensible of his drift , had she been able to attend ; but her heart was so full and her senses still so astonished , that she could listen but imperfectly even to what he told her of William , and saying only when he paused , “ How kind ! how very kind ! 
Fanny Price	patient	led	“ She must not go , she must allow him five minutes longer , ” and he took her hand and led her back to her seat , and was in the middle of his farther explanation , before she had suspected for what she was detained . 
Fanny Price	patient	detained	“ She must not go , she must allow him five minutes longer , ” and he took her hand and led her back to her seat , and was in the middle of his farther explanation , before she had suspected for what she was detained . 
Fanny Price	patient	treating	She considered it all as nonsense , as mere trifling and gallantry , which meant only to deceive for the hour ; she could not but feel that it was treating her improperly and unworthily , and in such a way as she had not deserved ; but it was like himself , and entirely of a piece with what she had seen before ; and she would not allow herself to shew half the displeasure she felt , because he had been conferring an obligation , which no want of delicacy on his part could make a trifle to her . 
Fanny Price	patient	injured	While her heart was still bounding with joy and gratitude on William ’s behalf , she could not be severely resentful of anything that injured only herself ; and after having twice drawn back her hand , and twice attempted in vain to turn away from him , she got up , and said only , with much agitation , “ Do n’t , Mr. Crawford , pray do n’t ! 
Fanny Price	patient	distress	Do not distress me . 
Fanny Price	patient	address	Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her so again : he must have seen how unwelcome it was to her ; and in that case , how gratefully she could esteem him for his friendship to William ! 
Fanny Price	patient	satisfied	She would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the great staircase , till she had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford ’s having left the house ; but when convinced of his being gone , she was eager to go down and be with her uncle , and have all the happiness of his joy as well as her own , and all the benefit of his information or his conjectures as to what would now be William ’s destination . 
Fanny Price	patient	vex	Thomas was as joyful as she could desire , and very kind and communicative ; and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William as to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her , till she found , towards the close , that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and dine there that very day . 
Fanny Price	patient	opened	She opened her note immediately , glad to have anything to do , and happy , as she read it , to feel that the fidgetings of her aunt Norris , who was also to dine there , screened her a little from view . 
Fanny Price	patient	screened	She opened her note immediately , glad to have anything to do , and happy , as she read it , to feel that the fidgetings of her aunt Norris , who was also to dine there , screened her a little from view . 
Fanny Price	patient	call	“ MY DEAR FANNY,—for so I may now always call you , to the infinite relief of a tongue that has been stumbling at _ Miss _ _ Price _ for at least the last six weeks — I can not let my brother go without sending you a few lines of general congratulation , and giving my most joyful consent and approval . 
Fanny Price	patient	smile	I chuse to suppose that the assurance of my consent will be something ; so you may smile upon him with your sweetest smiles this afternoon , and send him back to me even happier than he goes . 
Fanny Price	patient	compliment	” These were not expressions to do Fanny any good ; for though she read in too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss Crawford ’s meaning , it was evident that she meant to compliment her on her brother ’s attachment , and even to _ appear _ to believe it serious . 
Fanny Price	patient	addressing	She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her , and he spoke to her much too often ; and she was afraid there was a something in his voice and manner in addressing her very different from what they were when he talked to the others . 
Fanny Price	patient	tempted	, she was ready to sink with shame , from the dread of Mr. Crawford ’s interpretation ; for though nothing could have tempted her to turn her eyes to the right hand , where he sat , she felt that _ his _ were immediately directed towards her . 
Fanny Price	patient	turn	, she was ready to sink with shame , from the dread of Mr. Crawford ’s interpretation ; for though nothing could have tempted her to turn her eyes to the right hand , where he sat , she felt that _ his _ were immediately directed towards her . 
Fanny Price	patient	convinced	She had quite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas and Mr. Crawford joined them . 
Fanny Price	patient	understood	I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his manners ; if he understood me as well , he would , I dare say , behave differently . 
Fanny Price	patient	wanted	Fanny had hoped , in the course of his yesterday ’s visit , to hear the day named ; but he had only spoken of their journey as what would take place ere long . Having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note would convey , she could not but be astonished to see Mr. Crawford , as she accidentally did , coming up to the house again , and at an hour as early as the day before . His coming might have nothing to do with her , but she must avoid seeing him if possible ; and being then on her way upstairs , she resolved there to remain , during the whole of his visit , unless actually sent for ; and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house , there seemed little danger of her being wanted . 
Fanny Price	patient	employ	She sat some time in a good deal of agitation , listening , trembling , and fearing to be sent for every moment ; but as no footsteps approached the East room , she grew gradually composed , could sit down , and be able to employ herself , and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come and would go without her being obliged to know anything of the matter .

Fanny Price	patient	examine	The terror of his former occasional visits to that room seemed all renewed , and she felt as if he were going to examine her again in French and English . 
Fanny Price	patient	prevent	You have an understanding which will prevent you from receiving things only in part , and judging partially by the event . 
Fanny Price	patient	preparing	You will take in the whole of the past , you will consider times , persons , and probabilities , and you will feel that _ they _ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you for that mediocrity of condition which _ seemed _ to be your lot . Though their caution may prove eventually unnecessary , it was kindly meant ; and of this you may be assured , that every advantage of affluence will be doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been imposed .

Fanny Price	patient	detain	I must speak to you for a few minutes , but I will not detain you long . 
Fanny Price	patient	embarrassed	Fanny ’s colour grew deeper and deeper ; and her uncle , perceiving that she was embarrassed to a degree that made either speaking or looking up quite impossible , turned away his own eyes , and without any farther pause proceeded in his account of Mr. Crawford ’s visit . Mr. Crawford ’s business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny , make decided proposals for her , and entreat the sanction of the uncle , who seemed to stand in the place of her parents ; and he had done it all so well , so openly , so liberally , so properly , that Sir Thomas , feeling , moreover , his own replies , and his own remarks to have been very much to the purpose , was exceedingly happy to give the particulars of their conversation ; and little aware of what was passing in his niece ’s mind , conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her far more than himself .

Fanny Price	patient	see	He is in my room , and hoping to see you there . 
Fanny Price	patient	lift	But the removal of his alarm did his niece no service : as her unaccountableness was confirmed his displeasure increased ; and getting up and walking about the room with a frown , which Fanny could picture to herself , though she dared not lift up her eyes , he shortly afterwards , and in a voice of authority , said , “ Have you any reason , child , to think ill of Mr. Crawford ’s temper ? ” 
Fanny Price	patient	guide	But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse ; that you can and will decide for yourself , without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you , without even asking their advice . 
Fanny Price	patient	shewn	You have shewn yourself very , very different from anything that I had imagined . 
Fanny Price	patient	tell	you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness , you resolve to refuse him at once , without wishing even for a little time to consider of it , a little more time for cool consideration , and for really examining your own inclinations ; and are , in a wild fit of folly , throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life , eligibly , honourably , nobly settled , as will , probably , never occur to you again . Here is a young man of sense , of character , of temper , of manners , and of fortune , exceedingly attached to you , and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way ; and let me tell you , Fanny , that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford ’s estate , or a tenth part of his merits . Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him . 
Fanny Price	patient	acquit	if your heart can acquit you of _ ingratitude _ — ” He ceased . 
Fanny Price	patient	indulge	But Fanny shewed such reluctance , such misery , at the idea of going down to him , that Sir Thomas , after a little consideration , judged it better to indulge her . 
Fanny Price	patient	left	he left her in a glow of gratitude . 
Fanny Price	patient	save	Not to excite suspicion by her look or manner was now an object worth attaining ; and she felt equal to almost anything that might save her from her aunt Norris . 
Fanny Price	patient	struck	She was struck , quite struck , when , on returning from her walk and going into the East room again , the first thing which caught her eye was a fire lighted and burning . 
Fanny Price	patient	defend	“ Heaven defend me from being ungrateful ! ” 
Fanny Price	patient	saved	when she found how much and how unpleasantly her having only walked out without her aunt ’s knowledge could be dwelt on , she felt all the reason she had to bless the kindness which saved her from the same spirit of reproach , exerted on a more momentous subject . “ If I had known you were going out , I should have got you just to go as far as my house with some orders for Nanny , ” said she , “ which I have since , to my very great inconvenience , been obliged to go and carry myself .

Fanny Price	patient	saved	I could very ill spare the time , and you might have saved me the trouble , if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were going out . 
Fanny Price	patient	advise	, I have often observed it before — she likes to go her own way to work ; she does not like to be dictated to ; she takes her own independent walk whenever she can ; she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy , and independence , and nonsense , about her , which I would advise her to get the better of . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	misled	It was over , however , at last ; and the evening set in with more composure to Fanny , and more cheerfulness of spirits than she could have hoped for after so stormy a morning ; but she trusted , in the first place , that she had done right : that her judgment had not misled her . For the purity of her intentions she could answer ; and she was willing to hope , secondly , that her uncle ’s displeasure was abating , and would abate farther as he considered the matter with more impartiality , and felt , as a good man must feel , how wretched , and how unpardonable , how hopeless , and how wicked it was to marry without affection . When the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past , she could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally concluded , and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield , that everything would soon be as if no such subject had existed .

Fanny Price	patient	strike	In London he would soon learn to wonder at his infatuation , and be thankful for the right reason in her which had saved him from its evil consequences . While Fanny ’s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes , her uncle was , soon after tea , called out of the room ; an occurrence too common to strike her , and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared ten minutes afterwards , and advancing decidedly towards herself , said , “ Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you , ma’am , in his own room . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	put	Depend upon it , it is not you who are wanted ; depend upon it , it is me ” ( looking at the butler ) ; “ but you are so very eager to put yourself forward . 
Fanny Price	patient	want	What should Sir Thomas want you for ? 
Fanny Price	patient	found	Mrs. Norris , much discontented , was obliged to compose herself to work again ; and Fanny , walking off in agitating consciousness , found herself , as she anticipated , in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford . 
Fanny Price	patient	addressing	He was now the Mr. Crawford who was addressing herself with ardent , disinterested love ; whose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and upright , whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of attachment ; who was pouring out his sense of her merits , describing and describing again his affection , proving as far as words could prove it , and in the language , tone , and spirit of a man of talent too , that he sought her for her gentleness and her goodness ; and to complete the whole , he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William ’s promotion ! Here was a change , and here were claims which could not but operate !

Here was a change , and here were claims which could not but operate ! 
Fanny Price	patient	approached	She might have disdained him in all the dignity of angry virtue , in the grounds of Sotherton , or the theatre at Mansfield Park ; but he approached her now with rights that demanded different treatment . 
Fanny Price	patient	disgusted	Here was again a want of delicacy and regard for others which had formerly so struck and disgusted her . 
Fanny Price	patient	praised	Mr. Crawford ’s steadiness was honoured , and Fanny was praised , and the connexion was still the most desirable in the world . 
Fanny Price	patient	persuade	You can not suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations . 
Fanny Price	patient	convince	Your happiness and advantage are all that I have in view , and nothing is required of you but to bear with Mr. Crawford ’s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his . 
Fanny Price	patient	disliked	It was an injury and affront to Julia , who ought to have been Mr. Crawford ’s choice ; and , independently of that , she disliked Fanny , because she had neglected her ; and she would have grudged such an elevation to one whom she had been always trying to depress . 
Fanny Price	patient	blessed	Sir Thomas gave her more credit for discretion on the occasion than she deserved ; and Fanny could have blessed her for allowing her only to see her displeasure , and not to hear it . 
Fanny Price	patient	sought	To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of fortune , raised her , therefore , very much in her opinion . 
Fanny Price	patient	assail	Fanny coloured , and doubted at first what to say ; when , hoping to assail her on her vulnerable side , she presently answered — “ My dear aunt , _ you _ can not wish me to do differently from what I have done , I am sure . 
Fanny Price	patient	miss	_ You _ can not wish me to marry ; for you would miss me , should not you ? 
Fanny Price	patient	miss	Yes , I am sure you would miss me too much for that . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	silenced	It silenced her . 
Fanny Price	patient	interested	It was designed only to express his participation in all that interested her , and to tell her that he had been hearing what quickened every feeling of affection .

Fanny Price	patient	taken	His surprise was not so great as his father ’s at her refusing Crawford , because , so far from supposing her to consider him with anything like a preference , he had always believed it to be rather the reverse , and could imagine her to be taken perfectly unprepared , but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more desirable than he did . 
Fanny Price	patient	honouring	while honouring her for what she had done under the influence of her present indifference , honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas could quite echo , he was most earnest in hoping , and sanguine in believing , that it would be a match at last , and that , united by mutual affection , it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly fitted to make them blessed in each other , as he was now beginning seriously to consider them .

Fanny Price	patient	forced	She could not abstract her mind five minutes : she was forced to listen ; his reading was capital , and her pleasure in good reading extreme . 
Fanny Price	patient	taught	His acting had first taught Fanny what pleasure a play might give , and his reading brought all his acting before her again ; nay , perhaps with greater enjoyment , for it came unexpectedly , and with no such drawback 
Fanny Price	patient	used	as she had been used to suffer in seeing him on the stage with Miss Bertram . 
Fanny Price	patient	occupy	Edmund watched the progress of her attention , and was amused and gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework , which at the beginning seemed to occupy her totally : how it fell from her hand while she sat motionless over it , and at last , how the eyes which had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were turned and fixed on Crawford — fixed on him for minutes , fixed on him , in short , till the attraction drew Crawford ’s upon her , and the book was closed , and the charm was broken . 
Fanny Price	patient	addressing	stepping eagerly to Fanny , and addressing her in a softened voice ; and upon her saying “ No , ” he added , “ Are you sure you did not speak ? 
Fanny Price	patient	know	Here Fanny , who could not but listen , involuntarily shook her head , and Crawford was instantly by her side again , entreating to know her meaning ; and as Edmund perceived , by his drawing in a chair , and sitting down close by her , that it was to be a very thorough attack , that looks and undertones were to be well tried , he sank as quietly as possible into a corner , turned his back , and took up a newspaper , very sincerely wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into explaining away that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her ardent lover ; and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the business from himself in murmurs of his own , over the various advertisements of “ A most desirable Estate in South Wales ” ; “ To Parents and Guardians ” ; and a “ Capital season’d Hunter . ”

Fanny Price	patient	displease	What had I been saying to displease you ? 
Fanny Price	patient	entreat	Nay , nay , I entreat you ; for one moment put down your work . 
Fanny Price	patient	astonish	You quite astonish me ; I wonder how you can — ” “ Do I astonish you ? ” said he . 
Fanny Price	patient	urge	I will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner , all that gives me an interest in what you look and do , and excites my present curiosity . 
Fanny Price	patient	leave	I will not leave you to wonder long . ” In spite of herself , she could not help half a smile , but she said nothing . “ You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy .

Fanny Price	patient	delivered	The solemn procession , headed by Baddeley , of tea - board , urn , and cake - bearers , made its appearance , and delivered her from a grievous imprisonment of body and mind . 
Fanny Price	patient	protected	She was at liberty , she was busy , she was protected . 
Fanny Price	patient	protected	She was at liberty , she was busy , she was protected . 
Fanny Price	patient	used	She had been used to consult him in every difficulty , and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her confidence now ; he hoped to be of service to her , he thought he must be of service to her ; whom else had she to open her heart to ? 
Fanny Price	patient	loved	She had been used to consult him in every difficulty , and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her confidence now ; he hoped to be of service to her , he thought he must be of service to her ; whom else had she to open her heart to ?

Fanny Price	patient	joined	upon Sir Thomas ’s information of her being at that very time walking alone in the shrubbery , he instantly joined her . “ I am come to walk with you , Fanny , ” said he . 
Fanny Price	patient	Drawing	Drawing her arm within his . 
Fanny Price	patient	press	I do not mean to press you , however . 
Fanny Price	patient	blamed	But I thought you blamed me . 
Fanny Price	patient	attach	I may be sorry , I may be surprised — though hardly _ that _ , for you had not had time to attach yourself — but I think you perfectly right . 
Fanny Price	patient	correcting	“ I mean , ” she cried , sorrowfully correcting herself , “ that I _ think _ I never shall , as far as the future can be answered for ; I think I never shall return his regard . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	arming	I know that the apprehension of being forced to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you against him . 
Fanny Price	patient	tell	I wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for . 
Fanny Price	patient	known	I wish he had known you as well as I do , Fanny . 
Fanny Price	patient	won	Between us , I think we should have won you . 
Fanny Price	patient	deserve	I must hope , however , that time , proving him ( as I firmly believe it will ) to deserve you by his steady affection , will give him his reward . 
Fanny Price	patient	forget	You forget yourself : there is a decided difference in your tempers , I allow . 
Fanny Price	patient	support	He is lively , you are serious ; but so much the better : his spirits will support yours . 
Fanny Price	patient	oppress	After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes , Fanny , feeling it due to herself , returned to Mr. Crawford , and said , “ It is not merely in _ temper _ that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself ; though , in _ that _ respect , I think the difference between us too great , infinitely too great : his spirits often oppress me ; but there is something in him which I object to still more . 
Fanny Price	patient	persuaded	” “ I am persuaded that he does not think , as he ought , on serious subjects . ” “ Say , rather , that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects , which I believe to be a good deal the case . 
Fanny Price	patient	persuade	Well , though I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings , you will be persuaded into them , I trust . 
Fanny Price	patient	persuaded	Well , though I may not be able to persuade you into different feelings , you will be persuaded into them , I trust . 
Fanny Price	patient	used	I was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims , which she has been too much used to hear . 
Fanny Price	patient	see	You will see her , however , before she goes . 
Fanny Price	patient	calls	She calls herself very angry , but you can imagine her anger . 
Fanny Price	patient	hurt	She is hurt , as you would be for William ; but she loves and esteems you with all her heart . 
Fanny Price	patient	used	And I observed that she always spoke of you as ‘ Fanny , ’ which she was never used to do ; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality . 
Fanny Price	patient	took	He took me wholly by surprise . 
Fanny Price	patient	teaching	I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning ; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me . 
Fanny Price	patient	consider	His sisters should consider me as well as him . 
Fanny Price	patient	understand	I thought I could understand you . 
Fanny Price	patient	used	Their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour ; that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to ; and a great deal more to the same purpose , to give them a knowledge of your character . 
Fanny Price	patient	laying	She feared she had been doing wrong : saying too much , overacting the caution which she had been fancying necessary ; in guarding against one evil , laying herself open to another ; and to have Miss Crawford ’s liveliness repeated to her at such a moment , and on such a subject , was a bitter aggravation . Edmund saw weariness and distress in her face , and immediately resolved to forbear all farther discussion ; and not even to mention the name of Crawford again , except as it might be connected with what _ must _ be agreeable to her . 
Fanny Price	patient	oppressed	You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice . ” Still , however , Fanny was oppressed and wearied ; he saw it in her looks , it could not be talked away ; and attempting it no more , he led her directly , with the kind authority of a privileged guardian , into the house .

Fanny Price	patient	used	She must be used to the consideration of his being in love with her , and then a return of affection might not be very distant . 
Fanny Price	patient	persuaded	Edmund ’s account of Fanny ’s disposition he could believe to be just ; he supposed she had all those feelings , but he must consider it as very unfortunate that she _ had _ ; for , less willing than his son to trust to the future , he could not help fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit were necessary for her , she might not have persuaded herself into receiving his addresses properly before the young man ’s inclination for paying them were over . 
Fanny Price	patient	absented	She absented herself as little as possible from Lady Bertram , kept away from the East room , and took no solitary walk in the shrubbery , in her caution to avoid any sudden attack . 
Fanny Price	patient	see	She was determined to see Fanny alone , and therefore said to her tolerably soon , in a low voice , “ I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere ” ; words that Fanny felt all over her , in all her pulses and all her nerves . 
Fanny Price	patient	scolding	I do not know when I shall have done scolding you , ” and had discretion enough to reserve the rest till they might be secure of having four walls to themselves . 
Fanny Price	patient	finding	But the evil ready to burst on her was at least delayed by the sudden change in Miss Crawford ’s ideas ; by the strong effect on her mind which the finding herself in the East room again produced . 
Fanny Price	patient	recover	And having said so , with a degree of tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in her before , and now thought only too becoming , she turned away for a moment to recover herself . “ I have had a little fit since I came into this room , as you may perceive , ” said she presently , with a playful smile , “ but it is over now ; so let us sit down and be comfortable ; for as to scolding you , Fanny , which I came fully intending to do , I have not the heart for it when it comes to the point . ”

Fanny Price	patient	embracing	And embracing her very affectionately , “ Good , gentle Fanny ! 
Fanny Price	patient	seeing	when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long , I feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you . 
Fanny Price	patient	love	when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long , I feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you . 
Fanny Price	patient	affected	Fanny was affected . 
Fanny Price	patient	leave	She cried as if she had loved Miss Crawford more than she possibly could ; and Miss Crawford , yet farther softened by the sight of such emotion , hung about her with fondness , and said , “ I hate to leave you . 
Fanny Price	patient	roused	Fanny roused herself , and replying only in part , said , “ But you are only going from one set of friends to another . 
Fanny Price	patient	seeing	How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came along , and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work ; and then your cousin ’s astonishment , when he opened the door , at seeing me here ! 
Fanny Price	patient	transport	that I could transport you for a short time into our circle in town , that you might understand how your power over Henry is thought of there ! 
Fanny Price	patient	courted	If you were to see how he is courted , and how I am courted for his sake ! 
Fanny Price	patient	wish	Now , I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you . When she comes to know the truth she will , very likely , wish me in Northamptonshire again ; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser , by a first wife , whom she is wild to get married , and wants Henry to take . 
Fanny Price	patient	see	Innocent and quiet as you sit here , you can not have an idea of the _ sensation _ that you will be occasioning , of the curiosity there will be to see you , of the endless questions I shall have to answer ! 
Fanny Price	patient	tell	But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him , I should never have done . 
Fanny Price	patient	profess	But are you so insensible as you profess yourself ? 
Fanny Price	patient	tease	I will not tease you . 
Fanny Price	patient	please	You must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power . 
Fanny Price	patient	frightened	“ I will not say , ” replied Fanny , “ that I was not half afraid at the time of its being so , for there was something in your look that frightened me , but not at first ; I was as unsuspicious of it at first — indeed , indeed I was . 
Fanny Price	patient	induced	And had I had an idea of it , nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace . 
Fanny Price	patient	got	I leave him entirely to your mercy , and when he has got you at Everingham , I do not care how much you lecture him . 
Fanny Price	patient	loves	And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before ; that he loves you with all his heart , and will love you as nearly for ever as possible . 
Fanny Price	patient	love	And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before ; that he loves you with all his heart , and will love you as nearly for ever as possible . 
Fanny Price	patient	watching	The recollection of what had been done for William was always the most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr. Crawford ; and she sat thinking deeply of it till Mary , who had been first watching her complacently , and then musing on something else , suddenly called her attention by saying : “ I should like to sit talking with you here all day , but we must not forget the ladies below , and so good - bye , my dear , my amiable , my excellent Fanny , for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast - parlour , I must take leave of you here . 
Fanny Price	patient	overcome	Her disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond treatment , and from having hitherto known so little of it , she was the more overcome by Miss Crawford ’s . 
Fanny Price	patient	resign	Her secret was still her own ; and while that was the case , she thought she could resign herself to almost everything . 
Fanny Price	patient	forgiven	Fanny believed there was scarcely a second feeling in common between them ; and she may be forgiven by older sages for looking on the chance of Miss Crawford ’s future improvement as nearly desperate , for thinking that if Edmund ’s influence in this season of love had already done so little in clearing her judgment , and regulating her notions , his worth would be finally wasted on her even in years of matrimony . Experience might have hoped more for any young people so circumstanced , and impartiality would not have denied to Miss Crawford ’s nature that participation of the general nature of women which would lead her to adopt the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own .

Fanny Price	patient	sending	; for his prime motive in sending her away had very little to do with the propriety of her seeing her parents again , and nothing at all with any idea of making her happy . 
Fanny Price	patient	incline	He certainly wished her to go willingly , but he as certainly wished her to be heartily sick of home before her visit ended ; and that a little abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of Mansfield Park would bring her mind into a sober state , and incline her to a juster estimate of the value of that home of greater permanence , and equal comfort , of which she had the offer . 
Fanny Price	patient	had	A residence of eight or nine years in the abode of wealth and plenty had a little disordered her powers of comparing and judging . 
Fanny Price	patient	divided	, she must have had a strong attack of them when she first understood what was intended , when her uncle first made her the offer of visiting the parents , and brothers , and sisters , from whom she had been divided almost half her life ; of returning for a couple of months to the scenes of her infancy , with William for the protector and companion of her journey , and the 
Fanny Price	patient	surrounded	; to feel affection without fear or restraint ; to feel herself the equal of those who surrounded her ; to be at peace from all mention of the Crawfords , safe from every look which could be fancied a reproach on their account . 
Fanny Price	patient	reason	At a distance , unassailed by his looks or his kindness , and safe from the perpetual irritation of knowing his heart , and striving to avoid his confidence , she should be able to reason herself into a properer state ; she should be able to think of him as in London , and arranging everything there , without wretchedness . 
Fanny Price	patient	missing	And as to the not missing her , which under Mrs. Norris ’s discussion was the point attempted to be proved , she set herself very steadily against admitting any such thing . Sir Thomas had appealed to her reason , conscience , and dignity . 
Fanny Price	patient	miss	“ That may be , sister , ” was all Lady Bertram ’s reply . “ I dare say you are very right ; but I am sure I shall miss her very much . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	offer	Fanny wrote to offer herself ; and her mother ’s answer , though short , was so kind — a few simple lines expressed so natural and motherly a joy in the prospect of seeing her child again , as to confirm all the daughter ’s views of happiness in being with her — convincing her that she should now find a warm and affectionate friend in the “ mama ” who had certainly shewn no remarkable fondness for her formerly ; but this she could easily suppose to have been her own fault or her own fancy .

Fanny Price	patient	told	He told Fanny of it . 
Fanny Price	patient	arm	For this letter she must try to arm herself . 
Fanny Price	patient	talked	it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving her the affectionate farewell of a brother . All this passed overnight , for the journey was to begin very early in the morning ; and when the small , diminished party met at breakfast , William and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage . CHAPTER XXXVIII The novelty of travelling , and the happiness of being with William , soon produced their natural effect on Fanny ’s spirits , when Mansfield Park was fairly left behind ; and by the time their first stage was ended , and they were to quit Sir Thomas ’s carriage , she was able to take leave of the old coachman , and send back proper messages , with cheerful looks . Of pleasant talk between the brother and sister there was no end . 
Fanny Price	patient	employed	Everything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William ’s mind , and he was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their higher - toned subjects , all of which ended , if they did not begin , in praise of the Thrush , conjectures how she would be employed , schemes for an action with some superior force , which ( supposing the first lieutenant out of the way , and William was not very merciful to the first lieutenant ) was to give himself the next step as soon as possible , or speculations upon prize - money , which was to be generously distributed at home , with only the reservation of enough to make the little cottage comfortable , in which he and Fanny were to pass all their middle and later life together . Fanny ’s immediate concerns , as far as they involved Mr. Crawford , made 
Fanny Price	patient	distress	William knew what had passed , and from his heart lamented that his sister ’s feelings should be so cold towards a man whom he must consider as the first of human characters ; but he was of an age to be all for love , and therefore unable to blame ; and knowing her wish on the subject , he would not distress her by the slightest allusion . 
Fanny Price	patient	forced	Miss Crawford ’s style of writing , lively and affectionate , was itself an evil , independent of what she was thus forced into reading from the brother ’s pen , for Edmund would never rest till she had read the chief of the letter to him ; and then she had to listen to his admiration of her language , and the warmth of her attachments . 
Fanny Price	patient	obliging	There had , in fact , been so much of message , of allusion , of recollection , so much of Mansfield in every letter , that Fanny could not but suppose it meant for him to hear ; and to find herself forced into a purpose of that kind , compelled into a correspondence which was bringing her the addresses of the man she did not love , and obliging her to administer to the adverse passion of the man she did , was cruelly mortifying . 
Fanny Price	patient	interrupted	She was interrupted by a fine tall boy of eleven years old , who , rushing out of the house , pushed the maid aside , and while William was opening the chaise - door himself , called out , “ You are just in time . 
Fanny Price	patient	helped	And Mr. Campbell was here at four o’clock to ask for you : he has got one of the Thrush ’s boats , and is going off to her at six , and hoped you would be here in time to go with him . ” A stare or two at Fanny , as William helped her out of the carriage , was all the voluntary notice which this brother bestowed ; but he made no objection to her kissing him , though still entirely engaged in detailing farther particulars of the Thrush ’s going out of harbour , in which he had a strong right of interest , being to commence his career of seamanship in her at this very time . Another moment 
Fanny Price	patient	met	Fanny was in the narrow entrance - passage of the house , and in her mother ’s arms , who met her there with looks of true kindness , and with features which Fanny loved the more , because they brought her aunt Bertram ’s before her , and there were her two sisters : Susan , a well - grown fine girl of fourteen , and Betsey , the youngest of the family , about five — both glad to see her in their way , though with no advantage of manner in receiving her . But manner Fanny did not want .

Fanny Price	patient	love	Would they but love her , she should be satisfied . 
Fanny Price	patient	taken	She was then taken into a parlour , so small that her first conviction was of its being only a passage - room to something better , and she stood for a moment expecting to be invited on ; but when she saw there was no other door , and that there were signs of habitation before her , she called back her thoughts , reproved herself , and grieved lest they should have been suspected .

Fanny Price	patient	startled	” “ I was upstairs , mama , moving my things , ” said Susan , in a fearless , self - defending tone , which startled Fanny . 
Fanny Price	patient	informed	Susan and an attendant girl , whose inferior appearance informed Fanny , to her great surprise , that she had previously seen the upper servant , brought in everything necessary for the meal ; Susan looking , as she put the kettle on the fire and glanced at her sister , as if divided between the agreeable triumph of shewing her activity and usefulness , and the dread of being thought to demean herself by such an office . “ She had been into the kitchen , ” she said , “ to hurry Sally and help make the toast , and spread the bread and butter , or she did not know when they should have got tea , and she was sure her sister must want something after her journey .

Fanny Price	patient	keeping	She could not but own that she should be very glad of a little tea , and Susan immediately set about making it , as if pleased to have the employment all to herself ; and with only a little unnecessary bustle , and some few injudicious attempts at keeping her brothers in better order than she could 
Fanny Price	patient	acquitted	, acquitted herself very well . 
Fanny Price	patient	getting	Anxious not to appear unhappy , she soon recovered herself ; and wiping away her tears , was able to notice and admire all the striking parts of his dress ; listening with reviving spirits to his cheerful hopes of being on shore some part of every day before they sailed , and even of getting her to Spithead to see the sloop . 
Fanny Price	patient	interest	and Susan could only reproach , which she did very warmly , and evidently hoping to interest Fanny on her side . 
Fanny Price	patient	learnt	Fanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris , but a message to say she hoped that her god - daughter was a good girl , and learnt her book . 
Fanny Price	patient	struck	The smallness of the rooms above and below , indeed , and the narrowness of the passage and staircase , struck her beyond her imagination . 
Fanny Price	patient	wrote	CHAPTER XXXIX Could Sir Thomas have seen all his niece ’s feelings , when she wrote her first letter to her aunt , he would not have despaired ; for though a good night ’s rest , a pleasant morning , the hope of soon seeing William again , and the comparatively quiet state of the house , from Tom and Charles being gone to school , Sam on some project of his own , and her father on his usual lounges , enabled her to express herself cheerfully on the subject of home , there were still , to her own perfect consciousness , many drawbacks suppressed .

Fanny Price	patient	failed	Everything in that quarter failed her , except William ’s affection . 
Fanny Price	patient	left	William was gone : and the home he had left her in was , Fanny could not conceal it from herself , in almost every respect the very reverse of what she could have wished . 
Fanny Price	patient	noticed	There had remained only a general impression of roughness and loudness ; and now he scarcely ever noticed her , but to make her the object of a coarse joke . 
Fanny Price	patient	tempted	The doors were in constant banging , the stairs were never at rest , nothing was done without a clatter , nobody sat still , and nobody could command attention when they spoke . In a review of the two houses , as they appeared to her before the end of a week , Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson ’s celebrated judgment as to matrimony and celibacy , and say , that though Mansfield Park might have some pains , Portsmouth could have no pleasures . CHAPTER XL Fanny was right enough in not expecting to hear from Miss Crawford now at the rapid rate in which their correspondence had begun ; Mary ’s next letter was after a decidedly longer interval than the last , but she was not right in supposing that such an interval would be felt a great relief to herself . 
Fanny Price	patient	interest	In her present exile from good society , and distance from everything that had been wo nt to interest her , a letter from one belonging to the set where her heart lived , written with affection , and some degree of elegance , was thoroughly acceptable . 
Fanny Price	patient	spur	Is not it time for you to write to Fanny ? ’ to spur me on . 
Fanny Price	patient	found	At last , after various attempts at meeting , I have seen your cousins , ‘ dear Julia and dearest Mrs. Rushworth ’ ; they found me at home yesterday , and we were glad to see each other again . 
Fanny Price	patient	write	my dear sweet Fanny , this is a long letter from London : write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry ’s eyes , when he comes back , and send me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake . 
Fanny Price	patient	interested	One morning , about this time , Fanny having now been nearly four weeks from Mansfield , a point which she never failed to think over and calculate every day , as she and Susan were preparing to remove , as usual , upstairs , they were stopped by the knock of a visitor , whom they felt they could not avoid , from Rebecca ’s alertness in going to the door , a duty which always interested her beyond any other . 
Fanny Price	patient	recall	Good sense , like hers , will always act when really called upon ; and she found that she had been able to name him to her mother , and recall her remembrance of the name , as that of “ William ’s friend , ” though she could not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable at such a moment . 
Fanny Price	patient	keep	While trying to keep herself alive , their visitor , who had at first approached her with as animated a countenance as ever , was wisely and kindly keeping his eyes away , and giving her time to recover , while he devoted himself entirely to her mother , addressing her , and attending to her with the utmost politeness and propriety , at the same time with a degree of friendliness , of interest at least , which was making his manner perfect . Mrs. Price ’s manners were also at their best .

Fanny Price	patient	scold	She might scold herself for the weakness , but there was no scolding it away . 
Fanny Price	patient	used	Nothing of all that she had been used to think of as the proof of importance , or the employment of wealth , had brought him to Portsmouth . 
Fanny Price	patient	looked	By the time he had given all this information , it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to ; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye , and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London ; that she had sent her best and kindest love , but had had no time for writing ; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour , having spent scarcely twenty - four hours in London , after his return from Norfolk , before he set off again ; that her cousin Edmund was in town , had been in town , he understood , a few days ; that he had not seen him himself , but that he was well , had left them all well at Mansfield , and was to dine , as yesterday , with the Frasers . 
Fanny Price	patient	obliged	He stopt ; and , ungentlemanlike as he looked , Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr. Crawford . 
Fanny Price	patient	give	He must soon give her up , and cease to have the smallest inclination for the match ; and yet , though she had been so much wanting his affection to be cured , this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as the complaint ; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever , agreeable man , than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations . 
Fanny Price	patient	silenced	Fanny was doubly silenced here ; though when the moment was passed , could regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged comprehension of one half of his meaning , and encouraged him to say something more of his sister and Edmund .

Fanny Price	patient	telling	, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute ’s privacy for telling Fanny that his only business in Portsmouth was to see her ; that he was come down for a couple of days on her account , and hers only , and because he could not endure a longer total separation . She was sorry , really sorry ; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said , she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him ; he was much more gentle , obliging , and attentive to other people ’s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield ; she had never seen him so agreeable — so _ near _ being agreeable ; his behaviour to her father could not offend , and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of Susan . He was decidedly improved .

He was decidedly improved . 
Fanny Price	patient	grieved	It often grieved her to the heart to think of the contrast between them ; to think that where nature had made so little difference , circumstances should have made so much , and that her mother , as handsome as Lady Bertram , and some years her junior , should have an appearance so much more worn and faded , so comfortless , so slatternly , so shabby . 
Fanny Price	patient	seeing	She _ said _ she was very well , and did not like to be supposed otherwise ; but take it all in all , he was convinced that her present residence could not be comfortable , and therefore could not be salutary for her , and he was growing anxious for her being again at Mansfield , where her own happiness , and his in seeing her , must be so much greater . 
Fanny Price	patient	conveyed	“ And how are you to be conveyed back again ? 
Fanny Price	patient	forgotten	I know the danger of your being so far forgotten , as to have your comforts give way to the imaginary convenience of any single being in the family . 
Fanny Price	patient	left	I am aware that you may be left here week after week , if Sir Thomas can not settle everything for coming himself , or sending your aunt ’s maid for you , without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he may have laid down for the next quarter of a year . 
Fanny Price	patient	take	If , therefore ” ( turning again to Fanny ) , “ you find yourself growing unwell , and any difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield , without waiting for the two months to be ended , _ that _ must not be regarded as of any consequence , if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable than usual , and will only let my sister know it , give her only the slightest hint , she and I will immediately come down , and take you back to Mansfield . 
Fanny Price	patient	detaining	“ I wish you were not so tired , ” said he , still detaining Fanny after all the others were in the house—“I wish I left you in stronger health . 
Fanny Price	patient	left	“ I wish you were not so tired , ” said he , still detaining Fanny after all the others were in the house—“I wish I left you in stronger health . 
Fanny Price	patient	detained	“ Have you no message for anybody ? ” “ My love to your sister , if you please ; and when you see my cousin , my cousin Edmund , I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him . ” “ Certainly ; and if he is lazy or negligent , I will write his excuses myself . ” He could say no more , for Fanny would be no longer detained . 
Fanny Price	patient	constrained	She was so little equal to Rebecca ’s puddings and Rebecca ’s hashes , brought to table , as they all were , with such accompaniments of half - cleaned plates , and not half - cleaned knives and forks , that she was very often constrained to defer her heartiest meal till she could send her brothers in the evening for biscuits and buns . 
Fanny Price	patient	deserted	It was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend ; and though , in one light , glad to have him gone , it seemed as if she was now deserted by everybody ; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield ; and she could not think of his returning to town , and being frequently with Mary and Edmund , without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate herself for having them .

Fanny Price	patient	persuaded	Not considering in how different a circle she had been just seeing him , nor how much might be owing to contrast , she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and regardful of others than formerly . 
Fanny Price	patient	inform	— “ I have to inform you , my dearest Fanny , that Henry has been down to Portsmouth to see you ; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday , and one still more to be dwelt on the next day , on the ramparts ; when the balmy air , the sparkling sea , and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony , and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect .

Fanny Price	patient	had	My dear , dear Fanny , if I had you here , how I would talk to you ! 
Fanny Price	patient	advise	You should listen to me till you were tired , and advise me till you were still tired more ; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper , so I will abstain altogether , and leave you to guess what you like . 
Fanny Price	patient	leave	You should listen to me till you were tired , and advise me till you were still tired more ; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper , so I will abstain altogether , and leave you to guess what you like . 
Fanny Price	patient	plague	You have politics , of course ; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people and parties that fill up my time . 
Fanny Price	patient	touched	Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr. Crawford and herself , touched her , in comparison , slightly . 
Fanny Price	patient	told	What Fanny told her of former times dwelt more on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith ; and she paid her sister the compliment of preferring her style to that of any printed author . 
Fanny Price	patient	indulge	Susan , who had an innate taste for the genteel and well - appointed , was eager to hear , and Fanny could not but indulge herself in dwelling on so beloved a theme . 
Fanny Price	patient	distressed	That a girl so capable of being made everything good should be left in such hands , distressed her more and more . 
Fanny Price	patient	invite	Were _ she _ likely to have a home to invite her to , what a blessing it would be ! 
Fanny Price	patient	prepared	As she opened , and saw its length , she prepared herself for a minute detail of happiness and a profusion of love and praise towards the fortunate creature who was now mistress of his fate . 
Fanny Price	patient	told	Crawford told me that you were wishing to hear from me , but I found it impossible to write from London , and persuaded myself that you would understand my silence .

Fanny Price	patient	understand	Crawford told me that you were wishing to hear from me , but I found it impossible to write from London , and persuaded myself that you would understand my silence . 
Fanny Price	patient	returned	I am returned to Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it . 
Fanny Price	patient	tell	So very fond of you as Miss Crawford is , it is most natural that she should tell you enough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine . 
Fanny Price	patient	prevented	I will not be prevented , however , from making my own communication . 
Fanny Price	patient	tell	It will be a comfort to me to tell you how things now are , and what are my present plans , if plans I can be said to have . 
Fanny Price	patient	said	It will be a comfort to me to tell you how things now are , and what are my present plans , if plans I can be said to have . 
Fanny Price	patient	returned	I have been returned since Saturday . 
Fanny Price	patient	torturing	You know the weak side of her character , and may imagine the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me . 
Fanny Price	patient	blame	When I think of her great attachment to you , indeed , and the whole of her judicious , upright conduct as a sister , she appears a very different creature , capable of everything noble , and I am ready to blame myself for a too harsh construction of a playful manner . 
Fanny Price	patient	convinced	I am convinced that she is not without a decided preference . 
Fanny Price	patient	refused	That would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices , which , in fact , I am scarcely justified in asking ; and , if I am refused , that , I think , will be the honest motive . 
Fanny Price	patient	banish	Connected as we already are , and , I hope , are to be , to give up Mary Crawford would be to give up the society of some of those most dear to me ; to banish myself from the very houses and friends whom , under any other distress , I should turn to for consolation . 
Fanny Price	patient	explaining	I have nearly determined on explaining myself by letter . 
Fanny Price	patient	told	I could not see him and my eldest sister in the same room without recollecting what you once told me , and I acknowledge that they did not meet as friends . 
Fanny Price	patient	know	Edmund , you do not know me . 
Fanny Price	patient	touched	His warm regard , his kind expressions , his confidential treatment , touched her strongly . 
Fanny Price	patient	neglect	Her aunt did not neglect her : she wrote again and again ; they were receiving frequent accounts from Edmund , and these accounts were as regularly transmitted to Fanny , in the same diffuse style , and the same medley of trusts , hopes , and fears , all following and producing each other at haphazard . 
Fanny Price	patient	comfort	I am quite grieved for him , and very much frightened , and so is Sir Thomas ; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me . 
Fanny Price	patient	acquaint	Lady Bertram could think nothing less , and Fanny shared her aunt ’s security , till she received a few lines from Edmund , written purposely to give her a clearer idea of his brother ’s situation , and acquaint her with the apprehensions which he and his father had imbibed from the physician with respect to some strong hectic symptoms , which seemed to seize the frame on the departure of the fever . 
Fanny Price	patient	precede	It came , and she had yet heard nothing of her return — nothing even of the going to London , which was to precede her return . 
Fanny Price	patient	disposed	Fanny was disposed to think the influence of London very much at war with all respectable attachments . 
Fanny Price	patient	Forgive	It was weeks since she had heard anything of Miss Crawford or of her other connexions in town , except through Mansfield , and she was beginning to suppose that she might never know whether Mr. Crawford had gone into Norfolk again or not till they met , and might never hear from his sister any more this spring , when the following letter was received to revive old and create some new sensations — “ Forgive me , my dear Fanny , as soon as you can , for my long silence , and behave as if you could forgive me directly .

Fanny Price	patient	included	If it be so , I am sure you must be included in that part , that discerning part , and therefore entreat you to let me know how far I have been rightly informed . 
Fanny Price	patient	entreat	If it be so , I am sure you must be included in that part , that discerning part , and therefore entreat you to let me know how far I have been rightly informed . 
Fanny Price	patient	trouble	And now , do not trouble yourself to be ashamed of either my feelings or your own . 
Fanny Price	patient	Believe	Believe me , they are not only natural , they are philanthropic and virtuous . 
Fanny Price	patient	put	I put it to your conscience , whether ‘ Sir Edmund ’ would not do more good with all the Bertram property than any other possible ‘ Sir . ’ 
Fanny Price	patient	troubled	Had the Grants been at home I would not have troubled you , but you are now the only one I can apply to for the truth , his sisters not being within my reach . 
Fanny Price	patient	prefer	Could I immediately apply to either , however , I should still prefer you , because it strikes me that they have all along been so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up , as to shut their eyes to the truth . 
Fanny Price	patient	strikes	Could I immediately apply to either , however , I should still prefer you , because it strikes me that they have all along been so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up , as to shut their eyes to the truth . 
Fanny Price	patient	left	Happily , however , she was not left to weigh and decide between opposite inclinations and doubtful notions of right ; there was no occasion to determine whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not . 
Fanny Price	patient	fetch	“ Her uncle , she understood , meant to fetch her ; and 
Fanny Price	patient	thought	as her cousin ’s illness had continued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary , she must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present , and that she should be felt an encumbrance . ” Her representation of her cousin ’s state at this time was exactly according to her own belief of it , and such as she supposed would convey to the sanguine mind of her correspondent the hope of everything she was wishing for . 
Fanny Price	patient	throw	Its object was unquestionable ; and two moments were enough to start the probability of its being merely to give her notice that they should be in Portsmouth that very day , and to throw her into all the agitation of doubting what she ought to do in such a case . 
Fanny Price	patient	reached	This was the letter — “ A most scandalous , ill - natured rumour has just reached me , and I write , dear Fanny , to warn you against giving the least credit to it , should it spread into the country . 
Fanny Price	patient	warn	This was the letter — “ A most scandalous , ill - natured rumour has just reached me , and I write , dear Fanny , to warn you against giving the least credit to it , should it spread into the country . 
Fanny Price	patient	reached	As no scandalous , ill - natured rumour had reached her 
Fanny Price	patient	addressing	As to Mr. Crawford , she hoped it might give him a knowledge of his own disposition , convince him that he was not capable of being steadily attached to any one woman in the world , and shame him from persisting any longer in addressing herself . 
Fanny Price	patient	loved	She had begun to think he really loved her , and to fancy his affection for her something more than common ; and his sister still said that he cared for nobody else . 
Fanny Price	patient	relieve	It was impossible to banish the letter from her thoughts , and she could not relieve herself by speaking of it to any human being . 
Fanny Price	patient	roused	She sat in a blaze of oppressive heat , in a cloud of moving dust , and her eyes could only wander from the walls , marked by her father ’s head , to the table cut and notched by her brothers , where stood the tea - board never thoroughly cleaned , the cups and saucers wiped in streaks , the milk a mixture of motes floating in thin blue , and the bread and butter growing every minute more greasy than even Rebecca ’s hands had first produced it . Her father read his newspaper , and her mother lamented over the ragged carpet as usual , while the tea was in preparation , and wished Rebecca would mend it ; and Fanny was first roused by his calling out to her , after humphing and considering over a particular paragraph : “ What ’s the name of your great cousins in town , Fan ? ” 
Fanny Price	patient	enabled	A moment ’s recollection enabled her to say , “ Rushworth , sir . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	do	There ” ( holding out the paper to her ) ; “ much good may such fine relations do you . 
Fanny Price	patient	believe	She spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame ; she spoke with a resolution which sprung from despair , for she spoke what she did not , could not believe herself . 
Fanny Price	patient	told	yet her judgment told her it was so . 
Fanny Price	patient	confined	She confined herself , or tried to confine herself , to the simple , indubitable family misery which must envelop all , if it were indeed a matter of certified guilt and public exposure . 
Fanny Price	patient	confine	She confined herself , or tried to confine herself , to the simple , indubitable family misery which must envelop all , if it were indeed a matter of certified guilt and public exposure . 
Fanny Price	patient	met	He was alone , and met her instantly ; and she found herself pressed to his heart with only these words , just articulate , “ My Fanny , my only sister ; my only comfort now ! ” 
Fanny Price	patient	dismissed	Fanny ’s last meal in her father ’s house was in character with her first : she was dismissed from it as hospitably as she had been welcomed . How her heart swelled with joy and gratitude as she passed the barriers of Portsmouth , and how Susan ’s face wore its broadest smiles , may be easily conceived . 
Fanny Price	patient	reached	Edmund ’s deep sighs often reached Fanny . 
Fanny Price	patient	comforted	Fanny watched him with never - failing solicitude , and sometimes catching his eye , revived an affectionate smile , which comforted her ; but the first day ’s journey passed without her hearing a word from him on the subjects that were weighing him down . 
Fanny Price	patient	desert	How a man who had once loved , could desert you ! 
Fanny Price	patient	meet	Fanny had scarcely passed the solemn - looking servants , when Lady Bertram came from the drawing - room to meet her ; came with no indolent step ; and falling on her neck , said , “ Dear Fanny ! now I shall be comfortable . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	want	devoted to her aunt Bertram , returning to every former office with more than former zeal , and thinking she could never do enough for one who seemed so much to want her . 
Fanny Price	patient	required	Lady Bertram did not think deeply , but , guided by Sir Thomas , she thought justly on all important points ; and she saw , therefore , in all its enormity , what had happened , and neither endeavoured herself , nor required Fanny to advise her , to think little of guilt and infamy . 
Fanny Price	patient	justified	_ She _ should be justified . 
Fanny Price	patient	taking	He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf , in addition to all the rest , when they were in town : he had seen or conjectured his feelings ; and , having reason to think that one interview with Miss Crawford had taken place , from which Edmund derived only increased distress , had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him out of town , and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt , with a view to his relief and benefit , no less than theirs . 
Fanny Price	patient	understood	giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past . 
Fanny Price	patient	restored	And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem . 
Fanny Price	patient	wished	I only said in reply , that from my heart I wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room . 
Fanny Price	patient	thank	I thank you for your patience , Fanny . 
Fanny Price	patient	made	Till that happened , they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone , and how she had attached him , and how delightful nature had made her , and how excellent she would have been , had she fallen into good hands earlier . 
Fanny Price	patient	influenced	submitted to believe that Tom ’s illness had influenced her , only reserving for himself this consoling thought , that considering the many counteractions of opposing habits , she had certainly been _ more _ attached to him than could have been expected , and for his sake been more near doing right . 
Fanny Price	patient	returned	She was returned to Mansfield Park , she was useful , she was beloved ; she was safe from Mr. Crawford ; and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits , of his perfect approbation and increased regard ; and happy as all this must make her , she would still have been happy without any of it , for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford .

Fanny Price	patient	gone	Not even Fanny had tears for aunt Norris , not even when she was gone for ever . 
Fanny Price	patient	keep	To keep Fanny and the Bertrams from a knowledge of what was passing became his first object . 
Fanny Price	patient	regretting	All that followed was the result of her imprudence ; and he went off with her at last , because he could not help it , regretting Fanny even at the moment , but regretting her infinitely more when all the bustle of the intrigue was over , and a very few months had taught him , by the force of contrast , to place a yet higher value on the sweetness of her temper , the purity of her mind , and the excellence of her principles .

Fanny Price	patient	persuade	Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford , and observing to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such another woman , before it began to strike him whether a very different kind of woman might not do just as well , or a great deal better : whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear , as important to him in all her smiles and all her ways , as Mary Crawford had ever been ; and whether it might not be a possible , a hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love . I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion , that every one may be at liberty to fix their own , aware that the cure of unconquerable passions , and the transfer of unchanging attachments , must vary much as to time in different people . 
Fanny Price	patient	marry	I only entreat everybody to believe that exactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so , and not a week earlier , Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford , and became as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire . 
Fanny Price	patient	protecting	Loving , guiding , protecting her , as he had been doing ever since her being ten years old , her mind in so great a degree formed by his care , and her comfort depending on his kindness , an object to him of such close and peculiar interest , dearer by all his own importance with her than any one else at Mansfield , what was there now to add , but that he should learn to prefer soft light eyes to sparkling dark ones . 
Fanny Price	patient	settling	After settling her at Thornton Lacey with every kind attention to her comfort , the object of almost every day was to see her there , or to get her away from it .

Fanny Price	patient	get	After settling her at Thornton Lacey with every kind attention to her comfort , the object of almost every day was to see her there , or to get her away from it . 
Fanny Price	patient	established	First as a comfort to Fanny , then as an auxiliary , and last as her substitute , she was established at Mansfield , with every appearance of equal permanency . 
Fanny Price	patient	keeping	“ My dear Miss Price , ” said Miss Crawford , as soon as she was at all within hearing , “ I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting ; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself — I knew it was very late , and that I was behaving extremely ill ; and therefore , if you please , you must forgive me . 
Fanny Price	patient	mentioning	When Edmund , therefore , told her in reply , as he did when she would give him the hearing , that she need not distress herself on Mrs. Rushworth ’s account , because he had taken the opportunity , as he walked with her through the hall , of mentioning Miss Price as one who would probably be of the party , and had directly received a very sufficient invitation for his cousin , 
Fanny Price	patient	convinced	“ There , ” cried Miss Crawford , “ you have quite convinced Miss Price already . ” 
Fanny Price	patient	beg	My dear Miss Price , I beg your pardon , but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help . 
Fanny Price	patient	Thank	“ Thank you ; I am quite warm , very warm . 
Fanny Price	patient	fancy	You must rehearse it with me , that I may fancy _ you _ him , and get on by degrees . 
Fanny Price	patient	telling	“ I want to be your neighbour , Sir Thomas , as you have , perhaps , heard me telling Miss Price . 
Fanny Price	patient	brought	But Miss Price had not been brought up to the trade of _ coming _ _ out _ ; and had she known in what light this ball was , in general , considered respecting her , it would very much have lessened her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doing wrong and being looked at . 
Fanny Price	patient	respecting	But Miss Price had not been brought up to the trade of _ coming _ _ out _ ; and had she known in what light this ball was , in general , considered respecting her , it would very much have lessened her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doing wrong and being looked at . 
Fanny Price	patient	disoblige	But Miss Frances married , in the common phrase , to disoblige her family , and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines , without education , fortune , or connexions , did it very thoroughly . 
Fanny Price	patient	save	To save herself from useless remonstrance , Mrs. Price never wrote to her family on the subject till actually married . 
Fanny Price	patient	left	And without attempting any farther remonstrance , she left Fanny to her fate , a fate which , had not Fanny ’s heart been guarded in a way unsuspected by Miss Crawford , might have been a little harder than she deserved ; for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young ladies of eighteen ( or one should not read about them ) as are never to be persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent , manner , attention , and flattery can do , I have no inclination to believe Fanny one of them , or to think that with so much tenderness of disposition , and so much taste as belonged to her , she could have escaped heart - whole from the courtship ( though the courtship only of a fortnight ) of such a man as Crawford , in spite of there being some previous ill opinion of him to be overcome , had not her affection been engaged elsewhere . 
Fanny Price	patient	obliged	, his continued attentions — continued , but not obtrusive , and adapting themselves more and more to the gentleness and delicacy of her character — obliged her very soon to dislike him less than formerly . 
Fanny Price	patient	pleasing	A very few days were enough to effect this ; and at the end of those few days , circumstances arose which had a tendency rather to forward his views of pleasing her , inasmuch as they gave her a degree of happiness which must dispose her to be pleased with everybody . 
Fanny Price	patient	dispose	A very few days were enough to effect this ; and at the end of those few days , circumstances arose which had a tendency rather to forward his views of pleasing her , inasmuch as they gave her a degree of happiness which must dispose her to be pleased with everybody . 
Fanny Price	patient	pleasing	She had a letter from him herself , a few hurried happy lines , written as the ship came up Channel , and sent into Portsmouth with the first boat that left the Antwerp at anchor in Spithead ; and when Crawford walked up with the newspaper in his hand , which he had hoped would bring the first tidings , he found her trembling with joy over this letter , and listening with a glowing , grateful countenance to the kind invitation which her uncle was most collectedly dictating in reply . It was but the day before that Crawford had made himself thoroughly master of the subject , or had in fact become at all aware of her having such a brother , or his being in such a ship , but the interest then excited had been very properly lively , determining him on his return to town to apply for information as to the probable period of the Antwerp ’s return from the Mediterranean , etc . ; and the good luck which attended his early examination of ship news the next morning seemed the reward of his ingenuity in finding out such a method of pleasing her , as well as of his dutiful attention to the Admiral , in having for many years taken in the paper esteemed to have the earliest naval intelligence . 
Fanny Price	patient	elevated	But his intention , the kindness of his intention , was thankfully acknowledged : quite thankfully and warmly , for she was elevated beyond the common timidity of her mind by the flow of her love for William . 
Fanny Price	patient	bring	There could be no doubt of his obtaining leave of absence immediately , for he was still only a midshipman ; and as his parents , from living on the spot , must already have seen him , and be seeing him perhaps daily , his direct holidays might with justice be instantly given to the sister , who had been his best correspondent through a period of seven years , and the uncle who had done most for his support and advancement ; and accordingly the reply to her reply , fixing a very early day for his arrival , came as soon as possible ; and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny had been in the agitation of her first dinner - visit , when she found herself in an agitation of a higher nature , watching in the hall , in the lobby , on the stairs , for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her a brother . It came happily while she was thus waiting ; and there being neither ceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment of meeting , she was with him as he entered the house , and the first minutes of exquisite feeling had no interruption and no witnesses , unless the servants chiefly intent upon opening the proper doors could be called such . 
Fanny Price	patient	approaches	Yes , Mary , my Fanny will feel a difference indeed : a daily , hourly difference , in the behaviour of every being who approaches her ; and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer of it , that I am the person to give the consequence so justly her due . 
Fanny Price	patient	forgets	“ Nay , Henry , not by all ; not forgotten by all ; not friendless or forgotten . Her cousin Edmund never forgets her . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	seen	Suppose her a pretty girl , and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence , and I dare say there would be mischief .

Edmund Bertram	agent	persevered	For a long while no answer could be obtained beyond a “ no , no — not at all — no , thank you ” ; but he still persevered ; and no sooner

Edmund Bertram	agent	said	“ You are sorry to leave Mama , my dear little Fanny , ” said he , “ which shows you to be a very good girl ; but you must remember that you are with relations and friends , who all love you , and wish to make you happy . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	found	On pursuing the subject , he found that , dear as all these brothers and sisters generally were , there was one among them who ran more in her thoughts than the rest . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	prepared	Fanny thought it a bold measure , but offered no further resistance ; and they went together into the breakfast - room , where Edmund prepared her paper , and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brother could himself have felt , and probably with somewhat more exactness .

Edmund Bertram	agent	made	His kindness to his little cousin was consistent with his situation and rights : he made her some very pretty presents , and laughed at her . As her appearance and spirits improved , Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan ; and it was pretty soon decided between them that , though far from clever , she showed a tractable disposition , and seemed likely to give them little trouble .

Edmund Bertram	agent	told	Luckily the visit happened in the Christmas holidays , when she could directly look for comfort to her cousin Edmund ; and he told her such charming things of what William was to do , and be hereafter , in consequence of his profession , as made her gradually admit that the separation might have some use .

Edmund Bertram	agent	expected	He could not but wonder at her refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt ; but , as she took early care to make him , as well as Lady Bertram , understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family , he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which , at the same time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them , would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself . Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal ; and her spontaneous , untaught felicity on the discovery , conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	danced	As to her cousins ’ gaieties , she loved to hear an account of them , especially of the balls , and whom Edmund had danced with ; but thought too lowly of her own situation to imagine she should ever be admitted to the same , and listened , therefore , without an idea of any nearer concern in them . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	returned	When he returned , to understand how Fanny was situated , and perceived its ill effects , there seemed with him but one thing to be done ; and that “ Fanny must have a horse ” was the resolute declaration with which he opposed whatever could be urged by the supineness of his mother , or the economy of his aunt , to make it appear unimportant .

Edmund Bertram	agent	tell	Fanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story , but his determined silence obliged her to relate her brother ’s situation : her voice was animated in speaking of his profession , and the foreign stations he had been on ; but she could not mention the number of years that he had been absent without tears in her eyes .

Edmund Bertram	agent	encouraging	The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride , which the former caught , soon after her being settled at Mansfield , from the example of the young ladies at the Park , and which , when Edmund ’s acquaintance with her increased , led to his encouraging the wish , and the offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts , as the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	designed	No pain , no injury , however , was designed by him to his cousin in this offer : _ she _ was not to lose a day ’s exercise by it . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	presided	Edmund , who had taken down the mare and presided at the whole ,

Edmund Bertram	agent	added	Fanny ’s answer was extremely civil , and Edmund added his conviction that she could be in no hurry . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	said	“ For there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes , ” said he , “ and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner : clouds are now coming up , and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then .

Edmund Bertram	agent	looking	For a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in their praise of the night and their remarks on the stars , to think beyond themselves ; but when the first pause came , Edmund , looking around , said , “ But where is Fanny ? 
Edmund Bertram	agent	said	You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa . ” Before half this was said , Fanny was returned to her seat at the table , and had taken up her work again ; and Julia , who was in high good - humour , from the pleasures of the day , did her the justice of exclaiming , “ I must say , ma’am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . ” “ Fanny , ” said Edmund , after looking at her attentively , “ I am sure you have the headache . ” She could not deny it , but said it was not very bad . “ I can hardly believe you , ” he replied ; “ I know your looks too well .

Edmund Bertram	agent	cried	“ She has got it , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time . ” “ What ! ” cried Edmund ; “ has she been walking as well as cutting roses ; walking across the hot park to your house , and doing it twice , ma’am ? 
Edmund Bertram	agent	know	“ I was afraid it would be too much for her , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ but when the roses were gathered , your aunt wished to have them , and then you know they must be taken home

While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived , escorting his mother , who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially , in urging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton , which had been started a fortnight before , and which , in consequence of her subsequent absence from home , had since lain dormant .

Edmund Bertram	agent	made	Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonage successful ; and Edmund made his appearance just in time to learn what had been settled for Wednesday , to attend Mrs. Rushworth to her carriage , and walk half - way down the park with the two other ladies . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	found	On his return to the breakfast - room , he found Mrs. Norris trying to make up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford ’s being of the party were desirable or not , or whether her brother ’s barouche would not be full without her . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	said	The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea , assuring her that the barouche would hold four perfectly well , independent of the box , on which _ one _ might go with him . “ But why is it necessary , ” said Edmund , “ that Crawford ’s carriage , or his _ only _ , should be employed ? 
Edmund Bertram	agent	know	“ And , my dear Edmund , ” added Mrs. Norris , “ taking out _ two _ carriages when _ one _ will do , would be trouble for nothing ; and , between ourselves , coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and Sotherton : he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage , and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas , when he comes home , find all the varnish scratched off . ” 
Edmund Bertram	agent	suppose	I will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday . ” “ There is no hardship , I suppose , nothing unpleasant , ” said Edmund , “ in going on the barouche box . ”

Edmund Bertram	agent	turned	For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort : her prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side by side , full of conversation and merriment ; and to see only his expressive profile as he turned with a smile to Julia , or to catch the laugh of the other , was a perpetual source of irritation , which her own sense of propriety could but just smooth over .

Edmund Bertram	agent	found	Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth ; and when , after a little time , the others began to form into parties , these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund , Miss Crawford , and Fanny , who seemed as naturally to unite , and who , after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties , left them and walked on . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	said	“ A very praiseworthy practice , ” said Edmund , “ but not quite universal .

Edmund Bertram	agent	arrived	It was Fanny ’s first ball , though without the preparation or splendour of many a young lady ’s first ball , being the thought only of the afternoon , built on the late acquisition of a violin player in the servants ’ hall , and the possibility of raising five couple with the help of Mrs. Grant and a new intimate friend of Mr. Bertram ’s just arrived on a visit .

Edmund Bertram	agent	supposed	as the whole arrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody , and none at all to herself , as she foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry , bustle , and importance , and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself obliged to leave her own house , where she had been living a month at her own cost , and take up her abode in theirs , that every hour might be spent in their service , she was , in fact , exceedingly delighted with the project . CHAPTER XIV Fanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	began	An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from Northampton , and been cut out by Mrs. Norris ( with a saving by her good management of full three - quarters of a yard ) , and was actually forming into a curtain by the housemaids , and still the play was wanting ; and as two or three days passed away in this manner , Edmund began almost to hope that none might ever be found . There were , in fact , so many things to be attended to , so many people to be pleased , so many best characters required , and , above all , such a need that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy , that there did seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by youth and zeal could hold out . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	make	Agatha and Amelia appeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for home representation — the situation of one , and the language of the other , so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty , that she could hardly suppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in ; and longed to have them roused as soon as possible by the remonstrance which Edmund would certainly make . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	entered	Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well , though affecting to despise it ; and was too much engaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others , or draw any of those conclusions , or feel any of that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for . Thus much was settled before Edmund , who had been out all the morning , knew anything of the matter ; but when he entered the drawing - room before dinner , the buzz of discussion was high between Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates ; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him the agreeable news . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	turned	“ Lovers ’ Vows ! ” in a tone of the greatest amazement , was his only reply to Mr. Rushworth , and he turned towards his brother and sisters as if hardly doubting a contradiction . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	said	“ But what do you do for women ? ” said Edmund gravely , and looking at Maria . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	looking	“ But what do you do for women ? ” said Edmund gravely , and looking at Maria . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	thought	Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered , “ I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done , and ” ( with a bolder eye ) “ Miss Crawford is to be Amelia . ” “ I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up , with _ us _ , ” replied Edmund , turning away to the fire , where sat his mother , aunt , and Fanny , and seating himself with a look of great vexation .

Edmund Bertram	agent	answer	Edmund could not answer him . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	took	In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter ; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates , and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth , Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying , “ I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up .

Edmund Bertram	agent	found	Nobody was at the trouble of an answer ; the others soon returned ; and Edmund found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his only satisfaction . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	said	She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram , but Edmund said nothing . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	act	Mr. Edmund Bertram , as you do not act yourself , you will be a disinterested adviser ; and , therefore , I apply to _ you _ . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	said	“ _ I _ should have no objection , ” she replied ; “ for though I should not particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported , that is , if everything went well , I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience ; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at _ that _ _ table _ ” ( looking round ) , “ it certainly will not be taken . ” Edmund said no more .

Edmund Bertram	agent	advised	She could not compliment the newly arrived gentleman , however , with any appearance of interest , in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield , and sending for his hunters from Norfolk , which , suggested by Dr. Grant , advised by Edmund , and warmly urged by the two sisters , was soon in possession of his mind , and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her

Edmund Bertram	agent	live	Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother ; and as of course he will still live at home , it will be all for his _ menus _ _ plaisirs _ ; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter , I suppose , will be the sum total of sacrifice . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	have	By the time he is four or five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year , and nothing to do for it .

Edmund Bertram	agent	conniving	This was exactly what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at , as each proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they both advised Mrs. Norris ’s continuing where she was , instead of rushing out into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them . William and Fanny soon shewed themselves ; and Sir Thomas had the pleasure of receiving , in his protégé , certainly a very different person from the one he had equipped seven years ago , but a young man of an open , pleasant countenance , and frank , unstudied , but feeling and respectful manners , and such as confirmed him his friend .

Edmund Bertram	agent	grant	The farmyard must be moved , I grant you ; but I am not aware of anything else . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	mean	The house must be turned to front the east instead of the north — the entrance and principal rooms , I mean , must be on that side , where the view is really very pretty ; I am sure it may be done .

Edmund Bertram	agent	said	“ And Fanny had much rather it were William ’s , ” said Edmund , smiling at her .

Edmund Bertram	agent	had	Edmund , on this appeal , had first to hear what was going on ; but , on understanding the question , was at no loss for an answer . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	going	“ His going , though only eight miles , will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle ; but I should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile himself to doing less .

Edmund Bertram	agent	taking	Fanny ’s last feeling in the visit was disappointment : for the shawl which Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round her shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford ’s quicker hand , and she was obliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention .

Edmund Bertram	agent	seen	Miss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield , and on this circumstance the “ no ” and the “ yes ” had been very recently in alternation . He had seen her eyes sparkle as she spoke of the dear friend ’s letter , which claimed a long visit from her in London , and of the kindness of Henry , in engaging to remain where he was till January , that he might convey her thither ; he had heard her speak of the pleasure of such a journey with an animation which had “ no ” in every tone .

Edmund Bertram	agent	heard	He had since heard her express herself differently , with other feelings , more chequered feelings : he had heard her tell Mrs. Grant that she should leave her with regret ; that she began to believe neither the friends nor the pleasures she was going to were worth those she left behind ; and that though she felt she must go , and knew she should enjoy herself when once away , she was already looking forward to being at Mansfield again .

Was there not a “ yes ” in all this ? 
Edmund Bertram	agent	felt	To engage her early for the two first dances was all the command of individual happiness which he felt in his power , and the only preparation for the ball which he could enter into , in spite of all that was passing around him on the subject , from morning till night . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	begun	She would endeavour to be rational , and to deserve the right of judging of Miss Crawford ’s character , and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound intellect and an honest heart . She had all the heroism of principle , and was determined to do her duty ; but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature , let her not be much wondered at , if , after making all these good resolutions on the side of self - government , she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund had begun writing to her , as a treasure beyond all her hopes , and reading with the tenderest emotion these words , “ My very dear Fanny , you must do me the favour to accept ” locked it up with the chain , as the dearest part of the gift . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	came	He came towards her . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	looked	Fanny , not liking to complain , found it easiest to make no answer ; and though he looked at her with his usual kindness , she believed he had soon ceased to think of her countenance .

Edmund Bertram	agent	own	They have injured the finest mind ; for sometimes , Fanny , I own to you , it does appear more than manner : it appears as if the mind itself was tainted . ” 
Edmund Bertram	agent	want	Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment , and therefore , after a moment ’s consideration , said , “ If you only want me as a listener , cousin , I will be as useful as I can ; but I am not qualified for an adviser . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	cried	“ Dearest Fanny ! ” cried Edmund , pressing her hand to his lips with almost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford ’s , “ you are all considerate thought ! 
Edmund Bertram	agent	holding	in following her aunts out of the room , Edmund , who was holding open the door , said , as she passed him , “ You must dance with me , Fanny ; you must keep two dances for me ; any two that you like , except the first . ” 
Edmund Bertram	agent	Did	Did Edmund ? 
Edmund Bertram	agent	begin	Whenever she had thought of the minutiae of the evening , it had been as a matter of course that Edmund would begin with Miss Crawford ; and the impression was so strong , that though _ her _ _ uncle _ spoke the contrary , she could not help an exclamation of surprise , a hint of her unfitness , an entreaty even to be excused . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	said	“ I am worn out with civility , ” said he . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	talking	“ I have been talking incessantly all night , and with nothing to say . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	acknowledged	A weariness , arising probably , in great measure , from the same feelings which he had acknowledged in the morning , was peculiarly to be respected , and they went down their two dances together with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker - on that Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his younger son . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	found	Miss Crawford had been in gay spirits when they first danced together , but it was not her gaiety that could do him good : it rather sank than raised his comfort ; and afterwards , for he found himself still impelled to seek her again , she had absolutely pained him by her manner of speaking of the profession to which he was now on the point of belonging .

Edmund Bertram	agent	went	She felt the want of his society every day , almost every hour , and was too much in want of it to derive anything but irritation from considering the object for which he went . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	devised	He could not have devised anything more likely to raise his consequence than this week ’s absence , occurring as it did at the very time of her brother ’s going away , of William Price ’s going too , and completing the sort of general break - up of a party which had been so animated . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	planned	He should not have planned such an absence — he should not have left home for a week , when her own departure from Mansfield was so near .

If she had felt impatience and regret before — if she had been sorry for what she said , and feared its too strong effect on him — she now felt and feared it all tenfold more .

Edmund Bertram	agent	thought	In the evening a few circumstances occurred which he thought more promising . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	walked	When he and Crawford walked into the drawing - room , his mother and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if there were nothing else to care for . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	help	Edmund could not help noticing their apparently deep tranquillity . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	watched	Edmund watched the progress of her attention , and was amused and gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework , which at the beginning seemed to occupy her totally : how it fell from her hand while she sat motionless over it , and at last , how the eyes which had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were turned and fixed on Crawford — fixed on him for minutes , fixed on him , in short , till the attraction drew Crawford ’s upon her , and the book was closed , and the charm was broken .

Edmund Bertram	agent	hoped	Then she was shrinking again into herself , and blushing and working as hard as ever ; but it had been enough to give Edmund encouragement for his friend , and as he cordially thanked him , he hoped to be expressing Fanny ’s secret feelings too . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	said	“ That play must be a favourite with you , ” said he ; “ you read as if you knew it well . ” “ It will be a favourite , I believe , from this hour , ” replied Crawford ; “ but I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand before since I was fifteen . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	said	“ No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree , ” said Edmund , “ from one ’s earliest years . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	saw	Edmund saw it all , and saw Fanny so determined _ not _ to see it , as to make it clear that the voice was enough to convey the full meaning of the protestation ; and such a quick consciousness of compliment , such a ready comprehension of a hint , he thought , was rather favourable than not .

Edmund Bertram	agent	know	And I do not know that I should be fond of preaching often ; now and then , perhaps once or twice in the spring , after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together ; but not for a constancy ; it would not do for a constancy . ” 
Edmund Bertram	agent	perceived	Here Fanny , who could not but listen , involuntarily shook her head , and Crawford was instantly by her side again , entreating to know her meaning ; and as Edmund perceived , by his drawing in a chair , and sitting down close by her , that it was to be a very thorough attack , that looks and undertones were to be well tried , he sank as quietly as possible into a corner , turned his back , and took up a newspaper , very sincerely wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into explaining away that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her ardent lover ; and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the business from himself in murmurs of his own , over the various advertisements of “ A most desirable Estate in South Wales ” ; “ To Parents and Guardians ” ; and a “ Capital season’d Hunter . ”

Edmund Bertram	agent	depended	Edmund first began again — “ I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday , particularly pleased , because I had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	knew	I knew she was very fond of you ; but yet I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved , and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	mentioned	I should not have mentioned the subject , though very anxious to know her sentiments ; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart , and sweet peculiarity of manner , that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	reached	Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity . ” “ Was Mrs. Grant in the room , then ? ” “ Yes , when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in .

Edmund Bertram	agent	done	I have done . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	have	And , and — we think very differently of the nature of women , if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply . ” “ My dear , dear Fanny , now I have the truth . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	know	I know this to be the truth ; and most worthy of you are such feelings . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	attributed	I had attributed them to you before .

Edmund Bertram	agent	understand	I thought I could understand you . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	ventured	You have now given exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs. Grant , and they were both better satisfied , though your warm - hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for Henry . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	told	I told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least ; and that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford ’s addresses was against him . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	saw	She feared she had been doing wrong : saying too much , overacting the caution which she had been fancying necessary ; in guarding against one evil , laying herself open to another ; and to have Miss Crawford ’s liveliness repeated to her at such a moment , and on such a subject , was a bitter aggravation . Edmund saw weariness and distress in her face , and immediately resolved to forbear all farther discussion ; and not even to mention the name of Crawford again , except as it might be connected with what _ must _ be agreeable to her .

Edmund Bertram	agent	presumed	It had been , as he before presumed , too hasty a measure on Crawford ’s side , and time must be given to make the idea first familiar , and then agreeable to her . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	gave	He gave this opinion as the result of the conversation to his father ; and recommended there being nothing more said to her : no farther attempts to influence or persuade ; but that everything should be left to Crawford ’s assiduities , and the natural workings of her own mind .

Edmund Bertram	agent	called	The promised visit from “ her friend , ” as Edmund called Miss Crawford , was a formidable threat to Fanny , and she lived in continual terror of it .

Edmund Bertram	agent	do	Edmund , too — to be two months from _ him _ ( and perhaps she might be allowed to make her absence three ) must do her good . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	had	He too had a sacrifice to make to Mansfield Park as well as his aunt . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	intended	He had intended , about this time , to be going to London ; but he could not leave his father and mother just when everybody else of most importance to their comfort was leaving them ; and with an effort , felt but not boasted of , he delayed for a week or two longer a journey which he was looking forward to with the hope of its fixing his happiness for ever .

Edmund Bertram	agent	added	Lady Bertram had been telling her niece in the evening to write to her soon and often , and promising to be a good correspondent herself ; and Edmund , at a convenient moment , then added in a whisper , “ And _ I _ shall write to you , Fanny , when I have anything worth writing about , anything to say that I think you will like to hear , and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter . ”

Edmund Bertram	agent	giving	it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving her the affectionate farewell of a brother . All this passed overnight , for the journey was to begin very early in the morning ; and when the small , diminished party met at breakfast , William and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage . CHAPTER XXXVIII The novelty of travelling , and the happiness of being with William , soon produced their natural effect on Fanny ’s spirits , when Mansfield Park was fairly left behind ; and by the time their first stage was ended , and they were to quit Sir Thomas ’s carriage , she was able to take leave of the old coachman , and send back proper messages , with cheerful looks . Of pleasant talk between the brother and sister there was no end . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	rest	Miss Crawford ’s style of writing , lively and affectionate , was itself an evil , independent of what she was thus forced into reading from the brother ’s pen , for Edmund would never rest till she had read the chief of the letter to him ; and then she had to listen to his admiration of her language , and the warmth of her attachments .

Edmund Bertram	agent	hear	There had , in fact , been so much of message , of allusion , of recollection , so much of Mansfield in every letter , that Fanny could not but suppose it meant for him to hear ; and to find herself forced into a purpose of that kind , compelled into a correspondence which was bringing her the addresses of the man she did not love , and obliging her to administer to the adverse passion of the man she did , was cruelly mortifying . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	procured	Either his going had been again delayed , or he had yet procured no opportunity of seeing Miss Crawford alone , or he was too happy for letter - writing ! 
Edmund Bertram	agent	gets	“ I had almost forgot ( it was Edmund ’s fault : he gets into my head more than does me good ) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and myself — I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire .

Edmund Bertram	agent	acknowledged	He acknowledged no such inducement , and his sister ought to have given him credit for better feelings than her own . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	marry	He will marry her , and be poor and miserable . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	cease	God grant that her influence do not make him cease to be respectable ! ” 
Edmund Bertram	agent	proposes	Instead of being soon well enough to follow his friends , as he had then hoped , his disorder increased considerably , and it was not long before he thought so ill of himself as to be as ready as his physician to have a letter despatched to Mansfield . “ This distressing intelligence , as you may suppose , ” observed her ladyship , after giving the substance of it , “ has agitated us exceedingly , and we can not prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive for the poor invalid , whose state Sir Thomas fears may be very critical ; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother immediately , but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on this distressing occasion , as it would be too trying for me . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	gone	Tom dangerously ill , Edmund gone to attend him , and the sadly small party remaining at Mansfield , were cares to shut out every other care , or almost every other . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	written	She could just find selfishness enough to wonder whether Edmund _ had _ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came , but no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate and disinterestedly anxious . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	imbibed	Lady Bertram could think nothing less , and Fanny shared her aunt ’s security , till she received a few lines from Edmund , written purposely to give her a clearer idea of his brother ’s situation , and acquaint her with the apprehensions which he and his father had imbibed from the physician with respect to some strong hectic symptoms , which seemed to seize the frame on the departure of the fever . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	preferred	She could do nothing but glide in quietly and look at him ; but when able to talk or be talked to , or read to , Edmund was the companion he preferred . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	appeared	Fanny would certainly believe him so at least , and must find that her estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared as the attendant , supporter , cheerer of a suffering brother . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	had	Edmund ’s letter had this postscript . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	changed	“ On the subject of my last , I had actually begun a letter when called away by Tom ’s illness , but I have now changed my mind , and fear to trust the influence of friends . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	fear	“ On the subject of my last , I had actually begun a letter when called away by Tom ’s illness , but I have now changed my mind , and fear to trust the influence of friends . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	go	When Tom is better , I shall go . ” 
Edmund Bertram	agent	added	A line occasionally added by Edmund to his mother ’s letter was enough for Fanny ’s information . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	has	One should be a brute not to feel for the distress they are in ; and from what I hear , poor Mr. Bertram has a bad chance of ultimate recovery . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	send	If he wanted , he would send for her ; and even to offer an early return was a presumption which hardly anything would have seemed to justify . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	write	He is still able to think and act ; and I write , by his desire , to propose your returning home . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	suffering	The idea of immediately seeing him , with the knowledge of what he must be suffering , brought back all her own first feelings . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	say	She could say nothing ; nor for some minutes could he say more . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	turned	He turned away to recover himself , and when he spoke again , though his voice still faltered , his manner shewed the wish of self - command , and the resolution of avoiding any farther allusion .

Edmund Bertram	agent	find	When Mansfield was considered , time was precious ; and the state of his own mind made him find relief only in motion . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	walk	He would walk round the ramparts , and join them with the carriage . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	join	He would walk round the ramparts , and join them with the carriage . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	looked	He looked very ill ; evidently suffering under violent emotions , which he was determined to suppress . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	entered	The carriage came ; and he entered the house again at the same moment , just in time to spend a few minutes with the family , and be a witness — but that he saw nothing — of the tranquil manner in which the daughters were parted with , and just in time to prevent their sitting down to the breakfast - table , which , by dint of much unusual activity , was quite and completely ready as the carriage drove from the door .

Edmund Bertram	agent	took	Just before their setting out from Oxford , while Susan was stationed at a window , in eager observation of the departure of a large family from the inn , the other two were standing by the fire ; and Edmund , particularly struck by the alteration in Fanny ’s looks , and from his ignorance of the daily evils of her father ’s house , attributing an undue share of the change , attributing _ all _ to the recent event , took her hand , and said in a low , but very expressive tone , “ No wonder — you must feel it — you must suffer .

Edmund Bertram	agent	share	Edmund could not share it . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	leaning	She looked at him , but he was leaning back , sunk in a deeper gloom than ever , and with eyes closed , as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him , and the lovely scenes of home must be shut out .

Edmund Bertram	agent	shut	She looked at him , but he was leaning back , sunk in a deeper gloom than ever , and with eyes closed , as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him , and the lovely scenes of home must be shut out . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	trying	Lady Bertram could not give her much time , or many words , but she felt her , as Fanny ’s sister , to have a claim at Mansfield , and was ready to kiss and like her ; and Susan was more than satisfied , for she came perfectly aware that nothing but ill - humour was to be expected from aunt Norris ; and was so provided with happiness , so strong in that best of blessings , an escape from many certain evils , that she could have stood against a great deal more indifference than she met with from the others . She was now left a good deal to herself , to get acquainted with the house and grounds as she could , and spent her days very happily in so doing , while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut up , or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them , at this time , for everything like comfort ; Edmund trying to bury his own feelings in exertions for the relief of his brother ’s , and Fanny 
Edmund Bertram	agent	go	Sir Thomas set off , Edmund would go with him , and the others had been left in a state of wretchedness , inferior only to what followed the receipt of the next letters from London . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	left	Sir Thomas set off , Edmund would go with him , and the others had been left in a state of wretchedness , inferior only to what followed the receipt of the next letters from London . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	gave	She was mistaken , however , in supposing that Edmund gave his father no present pain . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	suffering	He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf , in addition to all the rest , when they were in town : he had seen or conjectured his feelings ; and , having reason to think that one interview with Miss Crawford had taken place , from which Edmund derived only increased distress , had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him out of town , and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt , with a view to his relief and benefit , no less than theirs .

Edmund Bertram	agent	admit	That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit of a doubt with Fanny ; and yet , till she knew that he felt the same , her own conviction was insufficient . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	felt	That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit of a doubt with Fanny ; and yet , till she knew that he felt the same , her own conviction was insufficient . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	did	She thought he did , but she wanted to be assured of it . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	speak	If he would now speak to her with the unreserve which had sometimes been too much for her before , it would be most consoling ; but _ that _ she found was not to be . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	avoided	He probably avoided being alone with her . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	yielded	He yielded , but it was with agonies which did not admit of speech . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	began	They reached Mansfield on Thursday , and it was not till Sunday evening that Edmund began to talk to her on the subject . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	seen	He had seen Miss Crawford . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	received	He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call ; and regarding it as what was meant to be the last , last interview of friendship , and investing her with all the feelings of shame and wretchedness which Crawford ’s sister ought to have known , he had gone to her in such a state of mind , so softened , so devoted , as made it for a few moments impossible to Fanny ’s fears that it should be the last .

Edmund Bertram	agent	proceeded	But as he proceeded in his story , these fears were over . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	said	She had met him , he said , with a serious — certainly a serious — even an agitated air ; but before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence , she had introduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him .

Edmund Bertram	agent	done	At last , “ Now , Fanny , ” said he , “ I shall soon have done . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	speak	As soon as I could speak , I replied that I had not supposed it possible , coming in such a state of mind into that house as I had done , that anything could occur to make me suffer more , but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence . That though I had , in the course of our acquaintance , been often sensible of some difference in our opinions , on points , too , of some moment ,

That though I had , in the course of our acquaintance , been often sensible of some difference in our opinions , on points , too , of some moment , 
Edmund Bertram	agent	pretended	That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister ( with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say ) , but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself , 
Edmund Bertram	agent	thought	giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	confess	And yet , that I must and would confess that , could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before , I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting , for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem .

Edmund Bertram	agent	said	This is what I said , the purport of it ; but , as you may imagine , not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	saw	I saw her change countenance . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	imagined	I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings : a great , though short struggle ; half a wish of yielding to truths , half a sense of shame , but habit , habit carried it .

Edmund Bertram	agent	hear	At this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey ; and when I hear of you next , it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists , or as a missionary into foreign parts . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	said	I only said in reply , that from my heart I wished her well , and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly , and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire , the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty , to the lessons of affliction , and immediately left the room .

Edmund Bertram	agent	heard	I had gone a few steps , Fanny , when I heard the door open behind me . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	looked	I looked back . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	resisted	I resisted ; it was the impulse of the moment to resist , and still walked on . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	go	I have since , sometimes , for a moment , regretted that I did not go back , but I know I was right , and such has been the end of our acquaintance . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	thank	I thank you for your patience , Fanny . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	contributing	and quite as soon as Sir Thomas could place dependence on such sources of good , Edmund was contributing to his father ’s ease by improvement in the only point in which he had given him pain before — improvement in his spirits . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	marrying	Would he have persevered , and uprightly , Fanny must have been his reward , and a reward very voluntarily bestowed , within a reasonable period from Edmund ’s marrying Mary . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	had	Edmund had greatly the advantage of her in this respect . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	wait	He had not to wait and wish with vacant affections for an object worthy to succeed her in them .

Edmund Bertram	agent	done	Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford , and observing to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such another woman , before it began to strike him whether a very different kind of woman might not do just as well , or a great deal better : whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear , as important to him in all her smiles and all her ways , as Mary Crawford had ever been ; and whether it might not be a possible , a hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love . I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion , that every one may be at liberty to fix their own , aware that the cure of unconquerable passions , and the transfer of unchanging attachments , must vary much as to time in different people .

Edmund Bertram	agent	became	I only entreat everybody to believe that exactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so , and not a week earlier , Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford , and became as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	learn	Loving , guiding , protecting her , as he had been doing ever since her being ten years old , her mind in so great a degree formed by his care , and her comfort depending on his kindness , an object to him of such close and peculiar interest , dearer by all his own importance with her than any one else at Mansfield , what was there now to add , but that he should learn to prefer soft light eyes to sparkling dark ones . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	done	Having once set out , and felt that he had done so on this road to happiness 
Edmund Bertram	agent	acknowledged	Even in the midst of his late infatuation , he had acknowledged Fanny ’s mental superiority . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	clothe	His happiness in knowing himself to have been so long the beloved of such a heart , must have been great enough to warrant any strength of language in which he could clothe it to her or to himself ; it must have been a delightful happiness . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	pondered	Sick of ambitious and mercenary connexions , prizing more and more the sterling good of principle and temper , and chiefly anxious to bind by the strongest securities all that remained to him of domestic felicity , he had pondered with genuine satisfaction on the more than possibility of the two young friends finding their natural consolation in each other for all that had occurred of disappointment to either ; and the joyful consent which met Edmund ’s application , the high sense of having realised a great acquisition in the promise of Fanny for a daughter , formed just such a contrast with his early opinion on the subject when the poor little girl ’s coming had been first agitated , as time is for ever producing between the plans and decisions of mortals , for their own instruction , and their neighbours ’ entertainment . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	wanted	Fanny was indeed the daughter that he wanted . 
Edmund Bertram	agent	made	He might have made her childhood happier ; but it had been an error of judgment only which had given him the appearance of harshness , and deprived him of her early love ; and now , on really knowing each other , their mutual attachment became very strong .

Edmund Bertram	patient	wrote	He wrote with his own hand his love to his cousin William , and sent him half a guinea under the seal . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	robbed	You have robbed Edmund for ten , twenty , thirty years , perhaps for life , of more than half the income which ought to be his . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	obliged	It may hereafter be in my power , or in yours ( I hope it will ) , to procure him better preferment ; but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us , and that nothing can , in fact , be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	disappoint	Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow ; but escaping as quickly as possible , could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect , firstly , that he had not been half so much in debt as some of his friends ; secondly , that his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it ; and , thirdly , that the future incumbent , whoever he might be , would , in all probability , die very soon . On Mr. Norris ’s death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant , who came consequently to reside at Mansfield ; and on proving to be a hearty man of forty - five , seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram ’s calculations . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	gratify	The Doctor was very fond of eating , and would have a good dinner every day ; and Mrs. Grant , instead of contriving to gratify him at little expense , gave her cook as high wages as they did at Mansfield Park , and was scarcely ever seen in her offices . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	made	this third he resolved to exchange for one that his cousin might ride ; he knew where such a one was to be met with ; and having once made up his mind , the whole business was soon completed . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	induce	It was some months before Sir Thomas ’s consent could be received ; but , in the meanwhile , as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasure in the connexion , the intercourse of the two families was carried on without restraint , and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs. Norris ’s talking of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of at present . Edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in the business ; but no representation of his aunt ’s could induce him to find Mr. Rushworth a desirable companion . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	seen	Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near them , and not at all displeased either at her sister ’s early care , or the choice it had fallen on . Matrimony was her object , provided she could marry well : and having seen Mr. Bertram in town , she knew that objection could no more be made to his person than to his situation in life . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	quizzing	You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	quiz	But I _ will _ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure , if you will tell me what about . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	imposed	you carry it off very well , but I can not be quite so far imposed 
Edmund Bertram	patient	introduced	When Anderson first introduced me to his family , about two years ago , his sister was not _ out _ , and I could not get her to speak to me . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	claimed	She came up to me , claimed me as an acquaintance , stared me out of countenance ; and talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	stared	She came up to me , claimed me as an acquaintance , stared me out of countenance ; and talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	attached	I made my bow in form ; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men , attached myself to one of her daughters , walked by her side all the way home , and made myself as agreeable as I could ; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners , and as ready to talk as to listen . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	forgiven	Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months ; and Miss Sneyd , I believe , has never forgiven me . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	miss	Mr. Bertram set off for — — — — , and Miss Crawford was prepared to find a great chasm in their society , and to miss him decidedly in the meetings which were now becoming almost daily between the families ; and 
Edmund Bertram	patient	silenced	It did not suit his sense of propriety , and he was silenced , till induced by further smiles and liveliness to put the matter by for the present . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	embarrassed	The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose : our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out ; but , in harvest , it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse . ” “ I shall understand all your ways in time ; but , coming down with the true London maxim , that everything is to be got with money , I was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	wish	“ If I write , I will say whatever you wish me ; but I do not , at present , foresee any occasion for writing . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	assure	” “ No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse , I assure you , ” said she , as she sprang down with his help 
Edmund Bertram	patient	assure	I sat three - quarters of an hour in the flower - garden , while Fanny cut the roses ; and very pleasant it was , I assure you , but very hot . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	restored	Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangement which restored him to his share of the party ; and Mrs. Norris thought it an excellent plan , and had it at her tongue ’s end , and was on the point of proposing it , when Mrs. Grant spoke . Wednesday was fine , and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived , Mr. Crawford driving his sisters ; and as everybody was ready , there was nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take their places . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	see	For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort : her prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side by side , full of conversation and merriment ; and to see only his expressive profile as he turned with a smile to Julia , or to catch the laugh of the other , was a perpetual source of irritation , which her own sense of propriety could but just smooth over . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	ordained	How unlucky that you are not ordained ; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	misunderstand	And with regard to their influencing public manners , Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me , or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of good - breeding , the regulators of refinement and courtesy , the masters of the ceremonies of life . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	told	With as much ease as I was told to go into this wilderness . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	forestall	“ Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two , but I forestall you ; remember , I have forestalled you . ” “ You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a _ bon _ _ mot _ , for there is not the least wit in my nature .

Edmund Bertram	patient	touch	“ You scarcely touch me , ” said he . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	used	At Oxford I have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street , and you are only a fly in the comparison . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	assure	“ My taking orders , I assure you , is quite as voluntary as Maria ’s marrying . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	biassed	“ Which you suppose has biassed me ? ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	affirm	“ Thank you for your good word , Fanny , but it is more than I would affirm myself . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	bias	On the contrary , the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	have	I have no doubt that I was biased , but I think it was blamelessly . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	ask	“ Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled , if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without ? 
Edmund Bertram	patient	leaving	Fanny turned farther into the window ; and Miss Crawford had only time to say , in a pleasant manner , “ I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it ” ; when , being earnestly invited by the Miss Bertrams to join in a glee , she tripped off to the instrument , leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many virtues , from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	brought	The season and duties which brought Mr. Bertram back to Mansfield took Mr. Crawford into Norfolk . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	convinced	“ I can not agree with you ; I am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	left	Tom walked out of the room as he said it , and Edmund was left to sit down and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	followed	Fanny ’s eyes followed Edmund , and her heart beat for him as she heard this speech , and saw his look , and felt what his sensations must be . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	seating	Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered , “ I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done , and ” ( with a bolder eye ) “ Miss Crawford is to be Amelia . ” “ I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up , with _ us _ , ” replied Edmund , turning away to the fire , where sat his mother , aunt , and Fanny , and seating himself with a look of great vexation . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	followed	Mr. Rushworth followed him to say , “ I come in three times , and have two - and - forty speeches . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	called	In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter ; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates , and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth , Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying , “ I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	convinced	It will not be necessary to send you to your _ father ’s _ judgment , I am convinced . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	convinced	“ I am convinced , madam , ” said Edmund , preventing Fanny , “ that Sir Thomas would not like it . ” “ There , my dear , do you hear what Edmund says ? ” “ If I were to decline the part , ” said Maria , with renewed zeal , “ Julia would certainly take it . ” “ What ! ” cried Edmund , “ if she knew your reasons ! ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	tempt	“ If _ any _ part could tempt _ you _ to act , I suppose it would be Anhalt , ” observed the lady archly , after a short pause ; “ for he is a clergyman , you know . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	disappoint	If I were to undertake it , I should only disappoint you . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	driven	Edmund might still look grave , and say he did not like the scheme in general , and must disapprove the play in particular ; their point was gained : he was to act , and he was driven to it by the force of selfish inclinations only . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	admitting	They behaved very well , however , to _ him _ on the occasion , betraying no exultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth , and seemed to think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of Charles Maddox , as if they had been forced into admitting him against their inclination . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	assured	Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his dress , Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt ’s last scene with the Baron admitted a good deal of action and emphasis , and Mr. Rushworth undertook to count his speeches . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	make	He had learned his part — all his parts , for he took every trifling one that could be united with the Butler , and began to be impatient to be acting ; and every day thus unemployed was tending to increase his sense of the insignificance of all his parts together , and make him more ready to regret that some other play had not been chosen . Fanny , being always a very courteous listener , and often the only listener at hand , came in for the complaints and the distresses of most of them . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	look	How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things ? 
Edmund Bertram	patient	fancy	You must rehearse it with me , that I may fancy _ you _ him , and get on by degrees . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	representing	She began , and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the idea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire ; but with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of a man . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	come	Surprise , consciousness , and pleasure appeared in each of the three on this unexpected meeting ; and as Edmund was come on the very same business that had brought Miss Crawford , consciousness and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in _ them _ . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	help	He too had his book , and was seeking Fanny , to ask her to rehearse with him , and help him to prepare for the evening , without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the house ; and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together , of comparing schemes , and sympathising in praise of Fanny ’s kind offices . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	alarm	I had very little hope of _ him _ from the first ; but you , Mrs. Grant , my sister , my own sister , I think I had a right to alarm you a little . ” “ Do not flatter yourself , my dearest Mary . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	flatter	I had very little hope of _ him _ from the first ; but you , Mrs. Grant , my sister , my own sister , I think I had a right to alarm you a little . ” “ Do not flatter yourself , my dearest Mary . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	moving	You have not the smallest chance of moving me . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	telling	if I could have altered the weather , you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time — for here are some of my plants which Robert _ will _ leave out because the nights are so mild , and I know the end of it will be , that we shall have a sudden change of weather , a hard frost setting in all at once , taking everybody ( at least Robert ) by surprise , and I shall lose every one ; and what is worse , cook has just been telling me that the turkey , which I particularly wished not to be dressed till Sunday , because I know 
Edmund Bertram	patient	invited	In the moment of parting , Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant to eat his mutton with him the next day ; and Fanny had barely time for an unpleasant feeling on the occasion , when Mrs. Grant , with sudden recollection , turned to her and asked for the pleasure of her company too . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	assure	“ And you know what your dinner will be , ” said Mrs. Grant , smiling—“the turkey , and I assure you a very fine one ; for , my dear , ” turning to her husband , “ cook insists upon the turkey ’s being dressed to - morrow . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	Thank	“ Thank you , I am _ so _ glad , ” was Fanny ’s instinctive reply ; though when she had turned from him and shut the door , she could not help feeling , “ And yet why should I be glad ? 
Edmund Bertram	patient	Leave	Leave him to settle _ that _ . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	engaged	Here he was again on the same ground where all had passed before , and apparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams , as if he had never known Mansfield in any other state . She heard them spoken of by him only in a general way , till they were all re - assembled in the drawing - room , when Edmund , being engaged apart in some matter of business with Dr. Grant , which seemed entirely to engross them , and Mrs. Grant occupied at the tea - table , he began talking of them with more particularity to his other sister . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	eyeing	Miss Crawford , who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund , now observed , “ Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	hear	You must preach at Mansfield , you know , that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	disconcert	” “ I shall keep clear of you , Crawford , as long as I can , ” said Edmund ; “ for you would be more likely to disconcert me , and I should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	meet	She _ had _ begun to think of him ; she felt that she had , with great regard , with almost decided intentions ; but she would now meet him with his own cool feelings . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	fixing	It was plain that he could have no serious views , no true attachment , by fixing himself in a situation which he must know she would never stoop to . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	match	She would learn to match him in his indifference . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	satisfied	I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	suffice	I think the house and premises may be made comfortable , and given the air of a gentleman ’s residence , without any very heavy expense , and that must suffice me ; and , I hope , may suffice all who care about me . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	content	Edmund might , in the common phrase , do the duty of Thornton , that is , he might read prayers and preach , without giving up Mansfield Park : he might ride over every Sunday , to a house nominally inhabited , and go through divine service ; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day , for three or four hours , if that would content him . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	prove	He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey ; and that if he does not live among his parishioners , and prove himself , by constant attention , their well - wisher and friend , he does very little either for their good or his own . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	see	One of whom , having never before understood that Thornton was so soon and so completely to be his home , was pondering with downcast eyes on what it would be _ not _ to see Edmund every day ; and the other , startled from the agreeable fancies she had been previously indulging on the strength of her brother ’s description , no longer able , in the picture she had been forming of a future Thornton , to shut out the church , sink the clergyman , and see only the respectable , elegant , modernised , and occasional residence of a man of independent fortune , was considering Sir Thomas , with decided ill - will , as the destroyer of all this , and suffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his character and manner commanded , and from not daring to relieve herself by a single attempt at throwing ridicule on his cause . All the agreeable of _ her _ speculation was over for that hour . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	love	Did she love him well enough to forego what had used to be essential points ? 
Edmund Bertram	patient	love	Did she love him well enough to make them no longer essential ? 
Edmund Bertram	patient	gone	and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton , and she had reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out , she walked down to the Parsonage without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private discussion ; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important part of it to Fanny , being more than half - ashamed of her own solicitude . She met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage , just setting out to call on her , and as it seemed to her that her friend , though obliged to insist on turning back , was unwilling to lose her walk , she explained her business at once , and observed , that if she would be so kind as to give her opinion , it might be all talked over as well without doors as within . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	consult	Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour without saying another word ; but Edmund , after waiting a moment , obliged her to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying , “ But what is it that you want to consult me about ? 
Edmund Bertram	patient	found	As she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday ; it had been about the same hour that she had returned from the Parsonage , and found Edmund in the East room . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	find	“ Suppose I were to find him there again to - day ! ” said she to herself , in a fond indulgence of fancy . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	saw	Starting and looking up , she saw , across the lobby she had just reached , Edmund himself , standing at the head of a different staircase . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	guess	“ You may guess my errand there , Fanny . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	distress	Fanny struggled for speech , and said , “ I am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	oblige	She had , to oblige Edmund , resolved to wear it ; but it was too large for the purpose . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	worn	His , therefore , must be worn ; and having , with delightful feelings , joined the chain and the cross — those memorials of the two most beloved of her heart , those dearest tokens so formed for each other by everything real and imaginary — and put them round her neck , and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were , she was able , without an effort , to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford ’s necklace too . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	worn	“ I am worn out with civility , ” said he . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	pained	Miss Crawford had been in gay spirits when they first danced together , but it was not her gaiety that could do him good : it rather sank than raised his comfort ; and afterwards , for he found himself still impelled to seek her again , she had absolutely pained him by her manner of speaking of the profession to which he was now on the point of belonging . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	brought	All this was bad , but she had still more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund ; when Saturday came and still no Edmund ; and when , through the slight communication with the other family which Sunday produced , she learned that he had actually written home to defer his return , having promised to remain some days longer with his friend . If she had felt impatience and regret before — if she had been sorry for what she said , and feared its too strong effect on him — she now felt and feared it all tenfold more . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	miss	You must miss him . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	seeing	He is a very — a very pleasing young man himself , and I can not help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London , as will now undoubtedly be the case . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	seen	I should like to have seen him once more , I confess . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	pressed	All that I heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer , and that he had agreed to do so . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	awaiting	Many surprises were awaiting him . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	taken	Coming as he did from such a purport fulfilled as had taken him away , he would have expected anything rather than a look of satisfaction , and words of simple , pleasant meaning . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	bring	It was enough to set his heart in a glow , and to bring him home in the properest state for feeling the full value of the other joyful surprises at hand . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	induced	CHAPTER XXXV Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse whether her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned between them or not ; and that if she did not lead the way , it should never be touched on by him ; but after a day or two of mutual reserve , he was induced by his father to change his mind , and try what his influence might do for his friend . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	consult	She had been used to consult him in every difficulty , and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her confidence now ; he hoped to be of service to her , he thought he must be of service to her ; whom else had she to open her heart to ? 
Edmund Bertram	patient	come	upon Sir Thomas ’s information of her being at that very time walking alone in the shrubbery , he instantly joined her . “ I am come to walk with you , Fanny , ” said he . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	suppose	But how could you possibly suppose me against you ? 
Edmund Bertram	patient	imagine	How could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love ? 
Edmund Bertram	patient	imagine	Were I even careless in general on such matters , how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake ? ” “ My uncle thought me wrong , and I knew he had been talking to you . ” “ As far as you have gone , Fanny , I think you perfectly right . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	astonished	And she spoke with a warmth which quite astonished Edmund , and which she blushed at the recollection of herself , when she saw his look , and heard him reply , “ Never ! 
Edmund Bertram	patient	heard	And she spoke with a warmth which quite astonished Edmund , and which she blushed at the recollection of herself , when she saw his look , and heard him reply , “ Never ! 
Edmund Bertram	patient	shocked	I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of it ; but , if she could undertake the part , we must not be surprised at the rest . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	used	It proves him , in short , everything that I had been used to wish to believe him , and feared he was not . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	pressed	I was most kindly pressed , and had nearly consented . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	tell	Had I received any letter from Mansfield , to tell me how you were all going on , I believe I should certainly have staid ; but I knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight , and felt that I had been away long enough . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	finding	I doubt their finding me so . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	tell	He did not understand her : he felt that he did not ; and therefore applied to Edmund to tell him how she stood affected on the present occasion , and whether she were more or less happy than she had been . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	surprised	What chiefly surprised Edmund was , that Crawford ’s sister , the friend and companion who had been so much to her , should not be more visibly regretted . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	think	If she could have believed Mary ’s future fate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother ’s should be , if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant as she was much inclined to think his , she would have been light of heart indeed ; but the more she recollected and observed , the more deeply was she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for Miss Crawford ’s marrying Edmund than it had ever been before . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	marrying	If she could have believed Mary ’s future fate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother ’s should be , if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant as she was much inclined to think his , she would have been light of heart indeed ; but the more she recollected and observed , the more deeply was she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for Miss Crawford ’s marrying Edmund than it had ever been before . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	deserve	love , but she did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	reasoned	So reasoned Edmund , till his father made him the confidant of a scheme which placed Fanny ’s chance of seeing the second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush in all his glory in another light . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	fixing	He had intended , about this time , to be going to London ; but he could not leave his father and mother just when everybody else of most importance to their comfort was leaving them ; and with an effort , felt but not boasted of , he delayed for a week or two longer a journey which he was looking forward to with the hope of its fixing his happiness for ever . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	had	Her greatest wonder on the subject soon became — not that Susan should have been provoked into disrespect and impatience against her better knowledge — but that so much better knowledge , so many good notions should have been hers at all ; and that , brought up in the midst of negligence and error , she should have formed such proper opinions of what ought to be ; she , who had had no cousin Edmund to direct her thoughts or fix her principles . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	pursuing	In this occupation she hoped , moreover , to bury some of the recollections of Mansfield , which were too apt to seize her mind if her fingers only were busy ; and , especially at this time , hoped it might be useful in diverting her thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London , whither , on the authority of her aunt ’s last letter , she knew he was gone . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	supposed	The postman ’s knock within the neighbourhood was beginning to bring its daily terrors , and if reading could banish the idea for even half an hour , it was something gained . CHAPTER XLI A week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town , and Fanny had heard nothing of him . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	seen	By the time he had given all this information , it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to ; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye , and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London ; that she had sent her best and kindest love , but had had no time for writing ; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour , having spent scarcely twenty - four hours in London , after his return from Norfolk , before he set off again ; that her cousin Edmund was in town , had been in town , he understood , a few days ; that he had not seen him himself , but that he was well , had left them all well at Mansfield , and was to dine , as yesterday , with the Frasers . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	give	The idea that returned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford , after proving herself cooled and staggered by a return to London habits , would yet prove herself in the end too much attached to him to give him up . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	known	_ She _ who had known him intimately half a year 
Edmund Bertram	patient	blinded	He is blinded , and nothing will open his eyes ; nothing can , after having had truths before him so long in vain . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	condemn	Fix , commit , condemn yourself . ” 
Edmund Bertram	patient	miss	We shall greatly miss Edmund in our small circle , but I trust and hope he will 
Edmund Bertram	patient	bring	find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be apprehended , and that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield shortly , which Sir Thomas proposes should be done , and thinks best on 
Edmund Bertram	patient	worried	His aunt worried him by her cares , and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down his conversation or his voice to the level of irritation and feebleness . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	believe	Fanny would certainly believe him so at least , and must find that her estimation of him was higher than ever when he appeared as the attendant , supporter , cheerer of a suffering brother . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	nurse	chiefly concerned for those who had to nurse him 
Edmund Bertram	patient	keep	Happily , however , she was not left to weigh and decide between opposite inclinations and doubtful notions of right ; there was no occasion to determine whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	forgiven	Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman , it seemed , under certain conditions of wealth ; and this , she suspected , was all the conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate himself upon . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	see	You will see me early by the mail.—Yours , etc . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	heard	The girls heard his entrance from above , and Fanny went down . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	seeing	The idea of immediately seeing him , with the knowledge of what he must be suffering , brought back all her own first feelings . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	recover	He turned away to recover himself , and when he spoke again , though his voice still faltered , his manner shewed the wish of self - command , and the resolution of avoiding any farther allusion . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	gone	He was gone again ; glad to get away even from Fanny . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	drove	Had he been alone with her , his heart must have opened in spite of every resolution ; but Susan ’s presence drove him quite into himself , and his attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never be long supported 
Edmund Bertram	patient	watched	Fanny watched him with never - failing solicitude , and sometimes catching his eye , revived an affectionate smile , which comforted her ; but the first day ’s journey passed without her hearing a word from him on the subjects that were weighing him down . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	weighing	Fanny watched him with never - failing solicitude , and sometimes catching his eye , revived an affectionate smile , which comforted her ; but the first day ’s journey passed without her hearing a word from him on the subjects that were weighing him down . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	oppressed	She looked at him , but he was leaning back , sunk in a deeper gloom than ever , and with eyes closed , as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him , and the lovely scenes of home must be shut out . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	get	He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf , in addition to all the rest , when they were in town : he had seen or conjectured his feelings ; and , having reason to think that one interview with Miss Crawford had taken place , from which Edmund derived only increased distress , had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him out of town , and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt , with a view to his relief and benefit , no less than theirs . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	engaged	He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf , in addition to all the rest , when they were in town : he had seen or conjectured his feelings ; and , having reason to think that one interview with Miss Crawford had taken place , from which Edmund derived only increased distress , had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him out of town , and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt , with a view to his relief and benefit , no less than theirs . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	saw	She seldom saw him : never alone . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	invited	He had been invited to see her . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	beg	He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call ; and regarding it as what was meant to be the last , last interview of friendship , and investing her with all the feelings of shame and wretchedness which Crawford ’s sister ought to have known , he had gone to her in such a state of mind , so softened , so devoted , as made it for a few moments impossible to Fanny ’s fears that it should be the last . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	met	She had met him , he said , with a serious — certainly a serious — even an agitated air ; but before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence , she had introduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	shocked	She had met him , he said , with a serious — certainly a serious — even an agitated air ; but before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence , she had introduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	see	“ ‘ I heard you were in town , ’ said she ; ‘ I wanted to see you . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	watching	After repeating this , Edmund was so much affected that Fanny , watching him with silent , but most tender concern , was almost sorry that the subject had been entered on at all . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	convinced	giving it every reproach but the right ; considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong ; and last of all , and above all , recommending to us a compliance , a compromise , an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin , on the chance of a marriage which , thinking as I now thought of her brother , should rather be prevented than sought ; all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her before , and that , as far as related to mind , it had been the creature of my own imagination , not Miss Crawford , that I had been too apt to dwell on for many months past . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	subdue	‘ Mr. Bertram , ’ said she , with a smile ; but it was a smile ill - suited to the conversation that had passed , a saucy playful smile , seeming to invite in order to subdue me ; at least it appeared so to me . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	deceived	And what an acquaintance has it been ! How have I been deceived ! 
Edmund Bertram	patient	put	Mary , though perfectly resolved against ever attaching herself to a younger brother again , was long in finding among the dashing representatives , or idle heir - apparents , who were at the command of her beauty , and her £ 20,000 , any one who could satisfy the better taste she had acquired at Mansfield , whose character and manners could authorise a hope of the domestic happiness she had there learned to estimate , or put Edmund Bertram sufficiently out of her head . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	strike	Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford , and observing to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such another woman , before it began to strike him whether a very different kind of woman might not do just as well , or a great deal better : whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear , as important to him in all her smiles and all her ways , as Mary Crawford had ever been ; and whether it might not be a possible , a hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love . I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion , that every one may be at liberty to fix their own , aware that the cure of unconquerable passions , and the transfer of unchanging attachments , must vary much as to time in different people . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	stop	, there was nothing on the side of prudence to stop him or make his progress slow ; no doubts of her deserving , no fears of opposition of taste , no need of drawing new hopes of happiness from dissimilarity of temper . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	knowing	His happiness in knowing himself to have been so long the beloved of such a heart , must have been great enough to warrant any strength of language in which he could clothe it to her or to himself ; it must have been a delightful happiness . 
Edmund Bertram	patient	deprived	He might have made her childhood happier ; but it had been an error of judgment only which had given him the appearance of harshness , and deprived him of her early love ; and now , on really knowing each other , their mutual attachment became very strong . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	had	Sir Thomas Bertram had interest , which , 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	had	from principle as well as pride — from a general wish of doing right , and a desire of seeing all that were connected with him in situations of respectability , he would have been glad to exert for the advantage of Lady Bertram ’s sister ; but her husband ’s profession was such as no interest could reach ; and before he had time to devise any other method of assisting them , an absolute breach between the sisters had taken place . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	think	No situation would be beneath him ; or what did Sir Thomas think of Woolwich ? 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	sent	Sir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions , Lady Bertram dispatched money and baby - linen , and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	dispatched	Sir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions , Lady Bertram dispatched money and baby - linen , and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	give	Sir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	debated	He debated and hesitated;—it was a serious charge;—a girl so brought up must be adequately provided for , or there would be cruelty instead of kindness in taking her from her family . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	provided	He debated and hesitated;—it was a serious charge;—a girl so brought up must be adequately provided for , or there would be cruelty instead of kindness in taking her from her family . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	thought	He thought of his own four children , of his two sons , of cousins in love , etc.;—but no sooner 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	begun	he deliberately begun to state his objections , than Mrs. Norris interrupted him with a reply to them all , whether stated or not 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	thinking	You are thinking of your sons — but do not you know that , of all things upon earth , _ that _ is the least likely to happen , brought up as they would be , always together like brothers and sisters ?

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	seen	Suppose her a pretty girl , and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence , and I dare say there would be mischief . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	say	But breed her up with them from this time , and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel , and she will never be more to either than a sister . ” “ There is a great deal of truth in what you say , ” replied Sir Thomas , “ and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	replied	But breed her up with them from this time , and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel , and she will never be more to either than a sister . ” “ There is a great deal of truth in what you say , ” replied Sir Thomas , “ and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	meant	I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in , and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price , and creditable to ourselves , we must secure to the child , or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter , as circumstances may arise , the provision of a gentlewoman , if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting . ” “ I thoroughly understand you , ” cried Mrs. Norris , “ you are everything that is generous and considerate , and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	know	Whatever I can do , as you well know , I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love ; and , though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children , nor consider her , in any respect , so much my own , I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	made	Except to the attack on Nanny ’s cousin , Sir Thomas no longer made any objection , and a more respectable , though less economical rendezvous being accordingly substituted , everything was considered as settled , and the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	heard	Sir Thomas heard with some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris ’s power to take any share in the personal charge of her . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	added	After a short pause Sir Thomas added with dignity , “ Yes , let her home be in this house . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	“ Should her disposition be really bad , ” said Sir Thomas , “ we must not , for our own children ’s sake , continue her in the family ; but there is no reason to expect so great an evil . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	trust	We shall probably see much to wish altered in her , and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance , some meanness of opinions , and very distressing vulgarity of manner ; but these are not incurable faults ; nor , I trust , can they be dangerous for her associates . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	hope	Had my daughters been _ younger _ than herself , I should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment ; but , as it is , I hope there can be nothing to fear for _ them _ , and everything to hope for _ her _ , from the association . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	observed	“ I hope she will not tease my poor pug , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ I have but just got Julia to leave it alone . ” “ There will be some difficulty in our way , Mrs. Norris , ” observed Sir Thomas , “ as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up : how to preserve in the minds of my _ daughters _ the consciousness of what they are , without making them think too lowly of their cousin ; and how , without depressing her spirits too far , to make her remember that she is not a _ Miss Bertram _ . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	wish	I should wish to see them very good friends , and would , on no account , authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation ; but still they can not be equals .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	received	Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly ; and Sir Thomas , seeing how much she needed encouragement , tried to be all that was conciliating : but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of deportment ; and Lady Bertram , without taking half so much trouble , or speaking one word where he spoke ten , by the mere aid of a good - humoured smile , became immediately the less awful character of the two .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	know	Sir Thomas did not know what was wanting , because , though a truly anxious father , he was not outwardly affectionate , and the reserve of his manner repressed all the flow of their spirits before him . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	forget	Amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested , Sir Thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of Mrs. Price : he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of her sons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit ; and Fanny , though almost totally separated from her family , was sensible of the truest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them , or of anything at all promising in their situation or conduct . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	feel	There was another family living actually held for Edmund ; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir Thomas ’s conscience , he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice , and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction , in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been able to say or do .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	listened	Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow ; but escaping as quickly as possible , could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect , firstly , that he had not been half so much in debt as some of his friends ; secondly , that his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it ; and , thirdly , that the future incumbent , whoever he might be , would , in all probability , die very soon . On Mr. Norris ’s death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant , who came consequently to reside at Mansfield ; and on proving to be a hearty man of forty - five , seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram ’s calculations .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	expected	The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister - in - law to claim her share in their niece , the change in Mrs. Norris ’s situation , and the improvement in Fanny ’s age , seeming not merely to do away any former objection to their living together , but even to give it the most decided eligibility ; and as his own circumstances were rendered less fair than heretofore , by some recent losses on his West India estate , in addition to his eldest son ’s extravagance , it became not undesirable to himself to be relieved from the expense of her support , and the obligation of her future provision . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	mentioned	In the fullness of his belief that such a thing must be , he mentioned its probability to his wife ; and the first time of the subject ’s occurring to her again happening to be when Fanny was present , she calmly observed to her , “ So , Fanny , you are going to leave us , and live with my sister . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	to	I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas , nor he to me .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	forbidden	They were relieved by it from all restraint ; and without aiming at one gratification that would probably have been forbidden by Sir Thomas , they felt themselves immediately at their own disposal , and to have every indulgence within their reach . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	go	Sir Thomas , who had done so much for her and her brothers , and who was gone perhaps never to return ! that she should see him go without a tear ! 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	He had said to her , moreover , on the very last morning , that he hoped she might see William again in the course of the ensuing winter , and had charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to be in England . “ This was so thoughtful and kind ! ” and would he only have smiled upon her , and called her “ my dear Fanny , ”

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	ended	But he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification , by adding , “ If William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . ”

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	spent	Tom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at home that he could be only nominally missed ; and Lady Bertram was soon astonished to find how very well they did even without his father , how well Edmund could supply his place in carving , talking to the steward , writing to the attorney , settling with the servants , and equally saving her from all possible fatigue or exertion in every particular but that of directing her letters .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	intended	was sure Sir Thomas had never intended it : and she must say that , to be making such a purchase in his absence , and adding to the great expenses of his stable , at a time when a large part of his income was unsettled , seemed to her very unjustifiable . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	settle	Lady Bertram did : she entirely agreed with her son as to the necessity of it , and as to its being considered necessary by his father ; she only pleaded against there being any hurry ; she only wanted him to wait till Sir Thomas ’s return , and then Sir Thomas might settle it all himself . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	beginning	Unfavourable circumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment when he was beginning to turn all his thoughts towards England ; and the very great uncertainty in which everything was then involved determined him on sending home his son , and waiting the final arrangement by himself . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	arrived	Tom arrived safely , bringing an excellent account of his father ’s health ; but to very little purpose , as far as Mrs. Norris was concerned . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	heard	Sir Thomas , however , was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance so unquestionably advantageous , and of which he heard nothing but the perfectly good and agreeable . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	conditioned	He only conditioned that the marriage should not take place before his return , which he was again looking eagerly forward to . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	wrote	He wrote in April , and had strong hopes of settling everything to his entire satisfaction , and leaving Antigua before the end of the summer . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	had	He wrote in April , and had strong hopes of settling everything to his entire satisfaction , and leaving Antigua before the end of the summer . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	had	Tom Bertram must have been thought pleasant , indeed , at any rate ; he was the sort of young man to be generally liked , his agreeableness was of the kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a higher stamp , for he had easy manners , excellent spirits , a large acquaintance , and a great deal to say ; and the reversion of Mansfield Park , and a baronetcy , did no harm to all this . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	do	Miss Crawford soon felt that he and his situation might do . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	had	It might do very well ; she believed she should accept him ; and she began accordingly to interest herself a little about the horse which he had to run at the B — — races .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	had	how you did tremble when Sir Thomas first had you put on ! ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	wrote	Sir Thomas wrote of it with as much decision as experience and anxiety could authorise . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	looked	His business was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take his passage in the September packet , and he consequently looked forward with the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	dancing	“ My dear Tom , ” cried his aunt soon afterwards , “ as you are not dancing , I dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber ; shall you ? ”

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	“ We must have a curtain , ” said Tom Bertram ; “ a few yards of green baize for a curtain , and perhaps that may be enough . ” “ Oh , quite enough , ” cried Mr. Yates , “ with only just a side wing or two run up , doors in flat , and three or four scenes to be let down ; nothing 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	prefer	“ True , to see real acting , good hardened real acting ; but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade : a set of gentlemen and ladies , who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through . ” After a short pause , however , the subject still continued , and was discussed with unabated eagerness , every one ’s inclination increasing by the discussion , and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest ; and though nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy , and his sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy , and that nothing in the world could be easier than to find a piece which would please them all , the resolution to act something or other seemed so decided as to make Edmund quite uncomfortable . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	began	Tom , returning from them into the drawing - room , where Edmund was standing thoughtfully by the fire , while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at a little distance , and Fanny close beside her arranging her work , thus began as he entered—“Such a horribly vile billiard - table as ours is not to be met with , I believe , above ground .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	” “ For everything of that nature I will be answerable , ” said Tom , in a decided tone . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	have	I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have ; and as to such alterations as I was suggesting just now , such as moving a bookcase , or unlocking a door , or even as using the billiard - room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it , you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room , and less in the breakfast - room , than we did before he went away , or to my sister ’s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	condition	Let it but be comic , I condition for nothing more . ” For about the fifth time he then proposed the Heir at Law , doubting only whether to prefer Lord Duberley or Dr. Pangloss for himself ; and very earnestly , but very unsuccessfully , trying to persuade the others that there were some fine tragic parts in the rest of the Dramatis Personæ . The pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended by the same speaker , who , taking up one of the many volumes of plays that lay on the table , and turning it over , suddenly exclaimed—“Lovers ’ Vows !

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	opposed	But this was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram , who asserted the part of Amelia to be in every respect the property of Miss Crawford , if she would accept it .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	began	Tom Bertram began again — “ Miss Crawford must be Amelia . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	walking	When this had lasted some time , the division of the party was completed by Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off together to consult farther in the room now beginning to be called _ the _ _ Theatre _ , and Miss Bertram ’s resolving to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer of Amelia to Miss Crawford ; and Fanny remained alone . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	known	I only wish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began , for there was the loss of half a day ’s work about those side - doors . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	cried	Such a forward young lady may well frighten the men . ” “ I should be but too happy in taking the part , if it were possible , ” cried Tom ; “ but , unluckily , the Butler and Anhalt are in together . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	try	I will not entirely give it up , however ; I will try what can be done — I will look it over again . ”

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	Her entreaty had no effect on Tom : he only said again what he had said before ; and it was not merely Tom , for the requisition was now backed by Maria , and Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Yates , with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious , and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny ; and before she could breathe after it , Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you !

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	go	“ Oh , cousin ! ” “ If you are against me , I ought to distrust myself , and yet — But it is absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way , riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act — no matter whom : the look of a gentleman is to be enough . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	“ Perhaps , ” said Tom , “ Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	comes	When Sir Thomas comes , I dare say he will be in for some borough , but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing anything yet .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	began	Entirely against _ his _ judgment , a scene - painter arrived from town , and was at work , much to the increase of the expenses , and , what was worse , of the eclat of their proceedings ; and his brother , instead of being really guided by him as to the privacy of the representation , was giving an invitation to every family who came in his way . Tom himself began to fret over the scene - painter ’s slow progress , and to feel the miseries of waiting . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	spoke	_ She _ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant dreadfully ; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford ; that Tom Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible ; that Mrs. Grant spoiled everything by laughing ; that Edmund was behindhand with his part , and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth , who was wanting a prompter through every speech .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	inquired	He inquired next after her family , especially William : and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little , and thinking his return a misfortune ; and when , on having courage to lift her eyes to his face , she saw that he was grown thinner , and had the burnt , fagged , worn look of fatigue and a hot climate , every tender feeling was increased , and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	had	He had the best right to be the talker ; and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own house , in the centre of his family , after such a separation , made him communicative and chatty in a very unusual degree ; and he was ready to give every information as to his voyage , and answer every question of his two sons almost before it was put .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	talk	It was so agreeable to her to see him again , and hear him talk , to have her ear amused and her whole comprehension filled by his narratives , that she began particularly to feel how dreadfully she must have missed him , and how impossible it would have been for her to bear a lengthened absence .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	think	His immediate communications were exhausted , and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him , now at one , now at another of the beloved circle ; but the pause was not long : in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative , and what were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say , “ How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately , Sir

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	know	Some one was talking there in a very loud accent ; he did not know the voice — more than talking — almost hallooing . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	stepped	He stepped to the door , rejoicing at that moment in having the means of immediate communication , and , opening it , found himself on the stage of a theatre , and opposed to a ranting young man , who appeared likely to knock him down backwards .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	lost	His father ’s looks of solemnity and amazement on this his first appearance on any stage , and the gradual metamorphosis of the impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well - bred and easy Mr. Yates , making his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram , was such an exhibition , such a piece of true acting , as he would not have lost upon any account .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	received	Sir Thomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which was due to his own character , but was really as far from pleased with the necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner of its commencement . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	felt	Mr. Yates ’s family and connexions were sufficiently known to him to render his introduction as the “ particular friend , ” another of the hundred particular friends of his son , exceedingly unwelcome ; and it needed all the felicity of being again at home , and all the forbearance it could supply , to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding himself thus bewildered in his own house , making part of a ridiculous exhibition in the midst of theatrical nonsense , and forced in so untoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young man whom he felt sure of disapproving , and whose easy indifference and volubility in the course of the first five minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of the two . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	understood	Tom understood his father ’s thoughts , and heartily wishing he might be always as well disposed to give them but partial expression , began to see , more clearly than he had ever done before , that there might be some ground of offence , that there might be some reason for the glance his father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room ; and that when he inquired with mild gravity after the fate of the billiard - table , he was not proceeding beyond a very allowable curiosity .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	exerted	A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side ; and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates , as to the happiness of the arrangement , the three gentlemen returned to the drawing - room together , Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which was not lost on all

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	feel	Edmund ’s first object the next morning was to see his father alone , and give him a fair statement of the whole acting scheme , defending his own share in it as far only as he could then , in a soberer moment , feel his motives to deserve , and acknowledging , with perfect ingenuousness , that his concession had been attended with such partial good as to make his judgment in it very doubtful .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	burning	The scene - painter was gone , having spoilt only the floor of one room , ruined all the coachman ’s sponges , and made five of the under - servants idle and dissatisfied ; and Sir Thomas was in hopes that another day or two would suffice to wipe away every outward memento of what had been , even to the destruction of every unbound copy of Lovers ’ Vows in the house , for he was burning all that met his eye . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	called	The evening passed with external smoothness , though almost every mind was ruffled ; and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his daughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	get	“ It is about my uncle ’s usual time . ” “ When do you think of going ? ” “ I may , perhaps , get as far as Banbury to - day . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	felt	In _ his _ departure Sir Thomas felt the chief interest : wanting to be alone with his family , the presence of a stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been irksome ; but of him , trifling and confident , idle and expensive , it was every way vexatious . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	became	In himself he was wearisome , but as the friend of Tom and the admirer of Julia he became offensive . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	walked	Sir Thomas had been quite indifferent to Mr. Crawford ’s going or staying : but his good wishes for Mr. Yates ’s having a pleasant journey , as he walked with him to the hall - door , were given with genuine satisfaction . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	solicit	The Rushworths were the only addition to his own domestic circle which he could solicit .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	applied	Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four days after Henry Crawford ’s leaving Mansfield , before her feelings were at all tranquillised , before she had given up every hope of him , or absolutely resolved on enduring his rival , her answer might have been different ; but after another three or four days , when there was no return , no letter , no message , no symptom of a softened heart , no hope of advantage from separation , her mind became cool enough to seek all the comfort that pride and self revenge could give . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	felt	Sir Thomas felt as an anxious father must feel , and was indeed experiencing much of the agitation which his wife had been apprehensive of for herself , but had fortunately escaped .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	consider	“ As you please , ma’am , on that head ; but I meant my father ’s opinion as to the _ propriety _ of the invitation ’s being accepted or not ; and I think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant , as well as by Fanny , that being the _ first _ invitation it should be accepted . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	looking	There was nothing more to be said , or that could be said to any purpose , till Sir Thomas were present ; but the subject involving , as it did , her own evening ’s comfort for the morrow , was so much uppermost in Lady Bertram ’s mind , that half an hour afterwards , on his looking in for a minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing - room , she called him back again , when he had almost closed the door , with “ Sir Thomas , stop a moment — I have something to say to you .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	came	Her tone of calm languor , for she never took the trouble of raising her voice , was always heard and attended to ; and Sir Thomas came back . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	“ Well , ” said Sir Thomas , as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise . “ Edmund wants her to go . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	“ She will be late , ” said Sir Thomas , taking out his watch ; “ but what is your difficulty ? ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	He told the whole ; and she had only to add , “ So strange ! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her . ” “ But is it not very natural , ” observed Edmund , “ that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? ” “ Nothing can be more natural , ” said Sir Thomas , after a short deliberation ; “ nor , were there no sister in the case , could anything , in my opinion , be more natural . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	feel	The only surprise I can feel is , that this should be the _ first _ time of its being paid . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	conclude	But as I conclude that she must wish to go , since all young people like to be together , I can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence . ” “ But can I do without her , Sir Thomas ? ” “ Indeed I think you may . ” “ She always makes tea , you know , when my sister is not here . ” “ Your sister , perhaps , may be prevailed on to spend the day with us , and I shall certainly be at home . ”

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	repeated	“ Walk ! ” repeated Sir Thomas , in a tone of most unanswerable dignity , and coming farther into the room . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	saw	The coachman drove round to a minute ; another minute brought down the gentleman ; and as the lady had , with a most scrupulous fear of being late , been many minutes seated in the drawing - room , Sir Thomas saw them off in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	hear	You must preach at Mansfield , you know , that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	conniving	This was exactly what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at , as each proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they both advised Mrs. Norris ’s continuing where she was , instead of rushing out into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them . William and Fanny soon shewed themselves ; and Sir Thomas had the pleasure of receiving , in his protégé , certainly a very different person from the one he had equipped seven years ago , but a young man of an open , pleasant countenance , and frank , unstudied , but feeling and respectful manners , and such as confirmed him his friend .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	observe	On the morrow they were walking about together with true enjoyment , and every succeeding morrow renewed a _ tête - à - tête _ which Sir Thomas could not but observe with complacency , even before Edmund had pointed it out to him . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	seemed	His readiness , however , in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage , when the general invitation was at last hazarded , after many debates and many doubts as to whether it were worth while , “ because Sir Thomas seemed so ill inclined , and Lady Bertram was so indolent ! ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	do	“ What shall I do , Sir Thomas ? 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	recommended	Whist and speculation ; which will amuse me most ? ” Sir Thomas , after a moment ’s thought , recommended speculation . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	inquired	Twice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of his lady , but in vain ; no pause was long enough for the time his measured manner needed ; and very little of her state could be known till Mrs. Grant was able , at the end of the first rubber , to go to her and pay her compliments . “ I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game . ”

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	seen	As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford ’s behaviour ; but when the whist - table broke up at the end of the second rubber , and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their last play , he became a looker - on at the other , he found his niece the object of attentions , or rather of professions , of a somewhat pointed character . Henry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about Thornton Lacey ; and not being able to catch Edmund ’s ear , was detailing it to his fair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	understands	“ Sir Thomas , ” said Edmund , “ undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish priest . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	observed	Henry Crawford ’s chair was the first to be given a direction towards them , and he sat silently observing them for a few minutes ; himself , in the meanwhile , observed by Sir Thomas , who was standing in chat with Dr. Grant . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	heard	He passed , however , for an admirer of her dancing ; and Sir Thomas , by no means displeased , prolonged the conversation on dancing in general , and was so well engaged in describing the balls of Antigua , and listening to what his nephew could relate of the different modes of dancing which had fallen within his observation , that he had not heard his carriage announced , and was first called to the knowledge of it by the bustle of Mrs. Norris . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	dissent	My dear Sir Thomas , we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you , and Edmund and William . ” Sir Thomas could not dissent , as it had been his own arrangement , previously communicated to his wife and sister ; but _ that _ seemed forgotten by Mrs. Norris , who must fancy that she settled it all herself .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	brought	Mr. Crawford was not far off ; Sir Thomas brought him to her , saying something which discovered to Fanny , that _ she _ was to lead the way and open the ball ; an idea that had never occurred to her before . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	smiled	; in vain , however : Sir Thomas smiled , tried to encourage her , and then looked too serious , and said too decidedly , “ It must be so , my dear , ” for her to hazard another word ; and she found herself the next moment conducted by Mr. Crawford to the top of the room , and standing there to be joined by the rest of the dancers , couple after couple , as they were formed .

Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas ’s thoughts as he stood , and having , in spite of all his wrongs towards her , a general prevailing desire of recommending herself to him , took an opportunity of stepping aside to say something agreeable of Fanny .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	bringing	A weariness , arising probably , in great measure , from the same feelings which he had acknowledged in the morning , was peculiarly to be respected , and they went down their two dances together with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker - on that Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his younger son . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	my good friend , ” said Sir Thomas , producing his watch with all necessary caution ; “ it is three o’clock , and your sister is not used to these sort of hours . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	asked	After a short consideration , Sir Thomas asked Crawford to join the early breakfast party in that house instead of eating alone : he should himself be of it ; and the readiness with which his invitation was accepted convinced him that the suspicions whence , he must confess to himself , this very ball had in great measure sprung , were well founded . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	interfering	Shortly afterward , Sir Thomas was again interfering a little with her inclination , by advising her to go immediately to bed . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	thinking	“ Advise ” was his word , but it was the advice of absolute power , and she had only to rise , and , with Mr. Crawford ’s very cordial adieus , pass quietly away ; stopping at the entrance - door , like the Lady of Branxholm Hall , “ one moment and no more , ” to view the happy scene , and take a last look at the five or six determined couple who were still hard at work ; and then , creeping slowly up the principal staircase , pursued by the ceaseless country - dance , feverish with hopes and fears , soup and negus , sore - footed and fatigued , restless and agitated , yet feeling , in spite of everything , that a ball was indeed delightful . In thus sending her away , Sir Thomas perhaps might not be thinking 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	mean	It might occur to him that Mr. Crawford had been sitting by her long enough , or he might mean to recommend her as a wife by shewing her persuadableness . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	reading	The cards were brought , and Fanny played at cribbage with her aunt till bedtime ; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself , no sounds were heard in the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the game—“And _ that _ makes thirty - one ; four in hand and eight in crib . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	added	“ And there is no reason to suppose , ” added Sir Thomas , “ but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	thought	This wish was levelled principally at Julia , who had just applied for permission to go to town with Maria ; and as Sir Thomas thought it best for each daughter that the permission should be granted , Lady Bertram , though in her own good - nature she would not have prevented it , was lamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia ’s return , which would otherwise have taken place about this time . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	improved	Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding , “ Very true . We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face , she is now a very valuable companion . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	paused	Sir Thomas paused , half smiled , glanced at his niece , and then gravely replied , “ She will never leave us , I hope , till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here . ” “ And _ that _ is not very likely to be , Sir Thomas . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	smiled	Sir Thomas paused , half smiled , glanced at his niece , and then gravely replied , “ She will never leave us , I hope , till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here . ” “ And _ that _ is not very likely to be , Sir Thomas .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	do	Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	written	If he had written to you , there would have been more particulars . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	sent	He would have sent you a description of everything and everybody . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	do	What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together do , what _ do _ they do for her happiness , comfort , honour , and dignity in the world , to what I _ shall _ do ? ” CHAPTER XXXI Henry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning , and at an earlier hour than common visiting warrants . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	know	She was almost at the door , and not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain , she still went on , after a civil reception , a short sentence about being waited for , and a “ Let Sir Thomas know ” to the servant . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	sought	It was no time for farther assurances or entreaty , though to part with her at a moment when her modesty alone seemed , to his sanguine and preassured mind , to stand in the way of the happiness he sought , was a cruel necessity . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	reached	She rushed out at an opposite door from the one her uncle was approaching , and was walking up and down the East room in the utmost confusion of contrary feeling , before Sir Thomas ’s politeness or apologies were over , or he had reached the beginning of the joyful intelligence which his visitor came to communicate . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	observed	Her comfort in that day ’s dinner was quite destroyed : she could hardly eat anything ; and when Sir Thomas good - humouredly observed that joy had taken away her appetite 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	told	“ Sir Thomas told me £ 10 would be enough . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	went	After a moment ’s pause , Sir Thomas , trying to suppress a smile , went on . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	gratifying	Fanny ’s colour grew deeper and deeper ; and her uncle , perceiving that she was embarrassed to a degree that made either speaking or looking up quite impossible , turned away his own eyes , and without any farther pause proceeded in his account of Mr. Crawford ’s visit . Mr. Crawford ’s business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny , make decided proposals for her , and entreat the sanction of the uncle , who seemed to stand in the place of her parents ; and he had done it all so well , so openly , so liberally , so properly , that Sir Thomas , feeling , moreover , his own replies , and his own remarks to have been very much to the purpose , was exceedingly happy to give the particulars of their conversation ; and little aware of what was passing in his niece ’s mind , conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her far more than himself . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	talked	He talked , therefore , for several minutes without Fanny ’s daring to interrupt him . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	ceased	For a moment he ceased , but she had barely become conscious of it , when , rising from his chair , he said , “ And now , Fanny , having performed one part of my commission , and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory , I may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs , where , though I can not but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself , I must submit to your finding one still better worth listening to .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	“ Am I to understand , ” said Sir Thomas , after a few moments ’ silence , “ that you mean to _ refuse _ Mr. Crawford ? ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	mean	“ Am I to understand , ” said Sir Thomas , after a few moments ’ silence , “ that you mean to _ refuse _ Mr. Crawford ? ”

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	like	“ I — I can not like him , sir , well enough to marry him . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	“ This is very strange ! ” said Sir Thomas , in a voice of calm displeasure . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	known	And he is not an acquaintance of to - day ; you have now known him some time . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	suppose	His sister , moreover , is your intimate friend , and he has been doing _ that _ for your brother , which I should suppose would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you , had there been no other . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	continued	“ You must have been aware , ” continued Sir Thomas presently , “ you must have been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford ’s manners to you . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	observed	You must have observed his attentions ; and though you always received them very properly ( I have no accusation to make on that head ) , I never perceived them to be unpleasant to you .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	looked	Sir Thomas looked at her with deeper surprise . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	said he .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	eyed	Young as you are , and having seen scarcely any one , it is hardly possible that your affections — ” He paused and eyed her fixedly . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	saw	He saw her lips formed into a _ no _ , though the sound was inarticulate , but her face was like scarlet . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	added	That , however , in so modest a girl , might be very compatible with innocence ; and chusing at least to appear satisfied , he quickly added , “ No , no , I know _ that _ is quite out of the question ; quite impossible . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	say	And for a few minutes he did say nothing . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	” said Sir Thomas , beginning again , and very composedly , “ his wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	judge	This is so much my opinion , that I am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son , your cousin , Mr. Bertram , is to marry early ; but at present , as far as I can judge , matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	wish	I wish he were more likely to fix . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	consider	“ Edmund , I consider , from his dispositions and habits , as much more likely to marry early than his brother . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	thought	_ He _ , indeed , I have lately thought , has seen the woman he could love , which , I am convinced , my eldest son has not . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	said	But the removal of his alarm did his niece no service : as her unaccountableness was confirmed his displeasure increased ; and getting up and walking about the room with a frown , which Fanny could picture to herself , though she dared not lift up her eyes , he shortly afterwards , and in a voice of authority , said , “ Have you any reason , child , to think ill of Mr. Crawford ’s temper ? ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	have	She longed to add , “ But of his principles I have ” ; but her heart sunk under the appalling prospect of discussion , explanation , and probably non - conviction . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	came	Sir Thomas came towards the table where she sat in trembling wretchedness , and with a good deal of cold sternness , said , “ It is of no use , I perceive , to talk to you .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	think	For I _ had _ , Fanny , as I think my behaviour must have shewn , formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to England . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	thought	I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper , self - conceit , and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much in modern days , even in young women , and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	imagined	You have shewn yourself very , very different from anything that I had imagined . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	tell	you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness , you resolve to refuse him at once , without wishing even for a little time to consider of it , a little more time for cool consideration , and for really examining your own inclinations ; and are , in a wild fit of folly , throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life , eligibly , honourably , nobly settled , as will , probably , never occur to you again . Here is a young man of sense , of character , of temper , of manners , and of fortune , exceedingly attached to you , and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way ; and let me tell you , Fanny , that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford ’s estate , or a tenth part of his merits . Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	gave	Maria is nobly married ; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia ’s hand , I should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria ’s to Mr. Rushworth . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	thought	I should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	began	“ If it were possible for me to do otherwise ” said she , with another strong effort ; “ but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him happy , and that I should be miserable myself . ” Another burst of tears ; but in spite of that burst , and in spite of that great black word _ miserable _ , which served to introduce it , Sir Thomas began to think a little relenting , a little change of inclination , might have something to do with it ; and to augur favourably from the personal entreaty of the young man himself . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	knew	He knew her to be very timid , and exceedingly nervous ; and thought it not improbable that her mind might be in such a state as a little time , a little pressing , a little patience , and a little impatience , a judicious mixture of all on the lover ’s side , might work their usual effect on . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	began	If the gentleman would but persevere , if he had but love enough to persevere , Sir Thomas began to have hopes ; and these reflections having passed across his mind and cheered it , “ Well , ” said he , in a tone of becoming gravity , but of less anger , “ well , child , dry up your tears .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	judged	But Fanny shewed such reluctance , such misery , at the idea of going down to him , that Sir Thomas , after a little consideration , judged it better to indulge her . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	looked	His hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered a small depression in consequence ; but when he looked at his niece , and saw the state of feature and complexion which her crying had brought her into , he thought there might be as much lost as gained by an immediate interview .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	walked	With a few words , therefore , of no particular meaning , he walked off by himself , leaving his poor niece to sit and cry over what had passed , with very wretched feelings . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	have	She wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think of such a trifle again ; but she soon found , from the voluntary information of the housemaid , who came in to attend it , that so it was to be every day .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	thought	As a general reflection on Fanny , Sir Thomas thought nothing could be more unjust , though he had been so lately expressing the same sentiments himself , and he tried to turn the conversation : tried repeatedly before he could succeed ; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment enough to perceive , either now , or at any other time , to what degree he thought well of his niece , or how very far he was from wishing to have his own children ’s merits set off by the depreciation of hers .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	wishes	In London he would soon learn to wonder at his infatuation , and be thankful for the right reason in her which had saved him from its evil consequences . While Fanny ’s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes , her uncle was , soon after tea , called out of the room ; an occurrence too common to strike her , and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared ten minutes afterwards , and advancing decidedly towards herself , said , “ Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you , ma’am , in his own room . ”

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	have	Your happiness and advantage are all that I have in view , and nothing is required of you but to bear with Mr. Crawford ’s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	engaged	I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls , as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	found	In spite of his intended silence , Sir Thomas found himself once more obliged to mention the subject to his niece , to prepare her briefly for its being imparted to her aunts ; a measure which he would still have avoided , if possible , but which became necessary from the totally opposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	understood	When Sir Thomas understood this , he felt the necessity of making his own wife and sister - in - law acquainted with the business without delay ; though , on Fanny ’s account , he almost dreaded the effect of the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	thought	A day , and a very early day , was actually fixed for the Crawfords ’ departure ; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one more effort for the young man before he left Mansfield , that all his professions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to sustain them as possible .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	hope	She had tasted of consequence in its most flattering form ; and he did hope that the loss of it , the sinking again into nothing , would awaken very wholesome regrets in her mind .

Sir Thomas Bertram	agent	give	By the time Mrs. Price ’s answer arrived , there remained but a very few days more to be spent at Mansfield ; and for part of one of those days the young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of their journey , for when the mode of it came to be talked of , and Mrs. Norris found that all her anxiety to save her brother - in - law ’s money was vain , and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less expensive conveyance of Fanny , they were to travel post ; when she saw Sir Thomas actually give William notes for the purpose , she was struck with the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage , and suddenly seized with a strong inclination to go with them , to go and see her poor dear sister Price .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	captivate	﻿ [ Mansfield Park by Jane Austen ( 1814 ) ] CHAPTER I About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward , of Huntingdon , with only seven thousand pounds , had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram , of Mansfield Park , in the county of Northampton , and to be thereby raised to the rank of a baronet ’s lady , with all the comforts and consequences of an handsome house and large income . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	interrupted	he deliberately begun to state his objections , than Mrs. Norris interrupted him with a reply to them all , whether stated or not 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	comprehend	“ My dear Sir Thomas , I perfectly comprehend you , and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions , which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct ; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one ’s own hands ; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	understand	I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in , and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price , and creditable to ourselves , we must secure to the child , or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter , as circumstances may arise , the provision of a gentlewoman , if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting . ” “ I thoroughly understand you , ” cried Mrs. Norris , “ you are everything that is generous and considerate , and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	bear	Whatever I can do , as you well know , I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love ; and , though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children , nor consider her , in any respect , so much my own , I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	resolved	The division of gratifying sensations ought not , in strict justice , to have been equal ; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and consistent patron of the selected child , and Mrs. Norris had not the least intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	made	His kindness to his little cousin was consistent with his situation and rights : he made her some very pretty presents , and laughed at her . As her appearance and spirits improved , Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan ; and it was pretty soon decided between them that , though far from clever , she showed a tractable disposition , and seemed likely to give them little trouble . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	leaving	From about the time of her entering the family , Lady Bertram , in consequence of a little ill - health , and a great deal of indolence , gave up the house in town , which she had been used to occupy every spring , and remained wholly in the country , leaving Sir Thomas to attend his duty in Parliament , with whatever increase or diminution of comfort might arise from her absence .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	pity	“ I blush for you , Tom , ” said he , in his most dignified manner ; “ I blush for the expedient which I am driven on , and I trust I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	misled	Not all her precautions , however , could save her from being suspected of something better ; or , perhaps , her very display of the importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose it really intended for Fanny . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	nursing	Here am I , a poor desolate widow , deprived of the best of husbands , my health gone in attending and nursing him , my spirits still worse , all my peace in this world destroyed , with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman , and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed — what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny ? 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	reconciled	The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light , and the hope of its utility to his son , reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the rest of his family , and of leaving his daughters to the direction of others at their present most interesting time of life . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	invite	He had said to her , moreover , on the very last morning , that he hoped she might see William again in the course of the ensuing winter , and had charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to be in England . “ This was so thoughtful and kind ! ” and would he only have smiled upon her , and called her “ my dear Fanny , ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	determined	Unfavourable circumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment when he was beginning to turn all his thoughts towards England ; and the very great uncertainty in which everything was then involved determined him on sending home his son , and waiting the final arrangement by himself . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	fated	“ If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to return , it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria well married , ” she very often thought ; always when they were in the company of men of fortune , and particularly on the introduction of a young man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and finest places in the country . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	thought	Tom Bertram must have been thought pleasant , indeed , at any rate ; he was the sort of young man to be generally liked , his agreeableness was of the kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a higher stamp , for he had easy manners , excellent spirits , a large acquaintance , and a great deal to say ; and the reversion of Mansfield Park , and a baronetcy , did no harm to all this . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	accept	It might do very well ; she believed she should accept him ; and she began accordingly to interest herself a little about the horse which he had to run at the B — — races . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	call	These races were to call him away not long after their acquaintance began ; and as it appeared that the family did not , from his usual goings on , expect him back again for many weeks , it would bring his passion to an early proof .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	justify	His business was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take his passage in the September packet , and he consequently looked forward with the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	mortified	Sir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half that his daughters felt on the subject of his return , and would hardly have found consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in the breast of another young lady . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	call	Sir Thomas was to return in November , and his eldest son had duties to call him earlier home . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	assure	never more so , I assure you . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	surprise	What is there to surprise you in it ? ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	throwing	this wo n’t do , ” cried Tom , throwing himself into a chair with a hearty laugh . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	give	I take any part you chuse to give me , so as it be comic . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	said	“ It falls as naturally , as necessarily to her , ” said he , “ as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	tell	I forgot to tell Tom of something that happened to me this very day . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	quiet	I am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom . ” Fanny could not answer him . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	see	“ You will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family , I assure you . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	bless	Could Sir Thomas look in upon us just now , he would bless himself , for we are rehearsing all over the house . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	receiving	The ruin of the play was to them a certainty : they felt the total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand ; while Mr. Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption , a disaster for the evening , and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal being renewed after tea , when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over , and he might be at leisure to be amused by it . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	correcting	He led her nearer the light and looked at her again — inquired particularly after her health , and then , correcting himself , observed that he need not inquire , 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	justified	A fine blush having succeeded the previous paleness of her face , he was justified in his belief of her equal improvement in health and beauty . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	loving	He inquired next after her family , especially William : and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little , and thinking his return a misfortune ; and when , on having courage to lift her eyes to his face , she saw that he was grown thinner , and had the burnt , fagged , worn look of fatigue and a hot climate , every tender feeling was increased , and she was miserable in considering how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	interrupting	His business in Antigua had latterly been prosperously rapid , and he came directly from Liverpool , having had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a private vessel , instead of waiting for the packet ; and all the little particulars of his proceedings and events , his arrivals and departures , were most promptly delivered , as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with heartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him — interrupting himself more than once , however , to remark on his good fortune in finding them all at home — coming unexpectedly as he did — all collected together exactly as he could have wished , but dared not depend on . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	listened	By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken , unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife , who was really extremely happy to see him , and whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer agitation than she had been for the last twenty years .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	see	It was so agreeable to her to see him again , and hear him talk , to have her ear amused and her whole comprehension filled by his narratives , that she began particularly to feel how dreadfully she must have missed him , and how impossible it would have been for her to bear a lengthened absence .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	seeing	Instead of being sent for out of the room , and seeing him first , and having to spread the happy news through the house , Sir Thomas , with a very reasonable dependence , perhaps , on the nerves of his wife and children , had sought no confidant but the butler , and had been following him almost instantaneously into the drawing - room .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	casting	Sir Thomas had been a good deal surprised to find candles burning in his room ; and on casting his eye round it , to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general air of confusion in the furniture . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	struck	struck him especially , but he had scarcely more than time to feel astonished at all this , before there were sounds from the billiard - room to astonish him still farther .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	knock	He stepped to the door , rejoicing at that moment in having the means of immediate communication , and , opening it , found himself on the stage of a theatre , and opposed to a ranting young man , who appeared likely to knock him down backwards . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	perceiving	At the very moment of Yates perceiving Sir Thomas , and giving perhaps the very best start he had ever given in the whole course of his rehearsals , Tom Bertram entered at the other end of the room ; and never had he found greater difficulty in keeping his countenance .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	save	Mr. Yates ’s family and connexions were sufficiently known to him to render his introduction as the “ particular friend , ” another of the hundred particular friends of his son , exceedingly unwelcome ; and it needed all the felicity of being again at home , and all the forbearance it could supply , to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding himself thus bewildered in his own house , making part of a ridiculous exhibition in the midst of theatrical nonsense , and forced in so untoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young man whom he felt sure of disapproving , and whose easy indifference and volubility in the course of the first five minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of the two .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	exerted	A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side ; and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr. Yates , as to the happiness of the arrangement , the three gentlemen returned to the drawing - room together , Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which was not lost on all 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	found	“ I come from your theatre , ” said he composedly , as he sat down ; “ I found myself in it rather unexpectedly . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	took	Its vicinity to my own room — but in every respect , indeed , it took me by surprise , as I had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	keep	And then he would have changed the subject , and sipped his coffee in peace over domestic matters of a calmer hue ; but Mr. Yates , without discernment to catch Sir Thomas ’s meaning , or diffidence , or delicacy , or discretion enough to allow him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the others with the least obtrusiveness himself , would keep him on the topic of the theatre , would torment him with questions and remarks relative to it , and finally would make him hear the whole history of

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	vindicating	He was anxious , while vindicating himself , to say nothing unkind of the others : but there was only one amongst them whose conduct he could mention without some necessity of defence or palliation . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	forgotten	Sir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among such a party , and at such a time , as strongly as his son had ever supposed he must ; he felt it too much , indeed , for many words ; and having shaken hands with Edmund , meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression , and forget how much he had been forgotten himself as soon as he could , after the house had been cleared of every object enforcing the remembrance , and restored to its proper state . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	hold	‘ Upon my word , Mrs. Norris , ’ said Mrs. Grant the other day , ‘ if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own , he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect . ’ 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	reinstate	He had to reinstate himself in all the wonted concerns of his Mansfield life : to see his steward and his bailiff ; to examine and compute , and , in the intervals of business , to walk into his stables and his gardens , and nearest plantations ; but active and methodical , he had not only done all this before he resumed his seat as master of the house at dinner , he had also set the carpenter to work in pulling down what had been so lately put up in the billiard - room , and given the scene - painter his dismissal long enough to justify the pleasing belief of his being then at least as far off as Northampton . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	meet	Her sensations were indefinable , and so were they a few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford , who had a chair between herself and Tom , ask the latter in an undervoice whether there were any plans for resuming the play after the present happy interruption ( with a courteous glance at Sir Thomas ) , because , in that case , he should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time required by the party : he was going away immediately , being to meet his uncle at Bath without delay ; but if there were any prospect of a renewal of Lovers ’ Vows , he should hold himself positively engaged , he should break through every other claim , he should absolutely condition with his uncle for attending them whenever he might be wanted .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	deceive	He can not much longer deceive himself . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	prevent	Not all his good - will for Mr. Rushworth , not all Mr. Rushworth ’s deference for him , could prevent him from soon discerning some part of the truth — that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man , as ignorant in business as in books , with opinions in general unfixed , and without seeming much aware of it himself . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	tell	Little observation there was necessary to tell him that indifference was the most favourable state they could be in . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	thanked	She thanked him for his great attention , his paternal kindness , but he was quite mistaken in supposing she had the smallest desire of breaking through her engagement , or was sensible of any change of opinion or inclination since her forming it . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	ask	I will ask Sir Thomas , as soon as he comes in , whether I can do without her . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	ask	We will ask him . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	called	There was nothing more to be said , or that could be said to any purpose , till Sir Thomas were present ; but the subject involving , as it did , her own evening ’s comfort for the morrow , was so much uppermost in Lady Bertram ’s mind , that half an hour afterwards , on his looking in for a minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing - room , she called him back again , when he had almost closed the door , with “ Sir Thomas , stop a moment — I have something to say to you . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	tell	It began , on Lady Bertram ’s part , with—“I have something to tell you 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	surprise	will surprise you 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	confirmed	This was exactly what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at , as each proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they both advised Mrs. Norris ’s continuing where she was , instead of rushing out into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them . William and Fanny soon shewed themselves ; and Sir Thomas had the pleasure of receiving , in his protégé , certainly a very different person from the one he had equipped seven years ago , but a young man of an open , pleasant countenance , and frank , unstudied , but feeling and respectful manners , and such as confirmed him his friend . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	amuse	Whist and speculation ; which will amuse me most ? ” Sir Thomas , after a moment ’s thought , recommended speculation . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	amuse	He was a whist player himself , and perhaps might feel that it would not much amuse him to have her for a partner . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	considering	One of whom , having never before understood that Thornton was so soon and so completely to be his home , was pondering with downcast eyes on what it would be _ not _ to see Edmund every day ; and the other , startled from the agreeable fancies she had been previously indulging on the strength of her brother ’s description , no longer able , in the picture she had been forming of a future Thornton , to shut out the church , sink the clergyman , and see only the respectable , elegant , modernised , and occasional residence of a man of independent fortune , was considering Sir Thomas , with decided ill - will , as the destroyer of all this , and suffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his character and manner commanded , and from not daring to relieve herself by a single attempt at throwing ridicule on his cause . All the agreeable of _ her _ speculation was over for that hour . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	tempted	If dear Julia were at home , or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton , to afford a reason , an occasion for such a thing , you would be tempted to give the young people a dance at Mansfield . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	assured	Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very little trouble ; and she assured him “ that she was not at all afraid of the trouble ; indeed , she could not imagine there would be any . ” 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	amusing	Sir Thomas had been amusing himself with shaping a very complete outline of the business ; and as soon as she would listen quietly , could read his list of the families to be invited , from whom he calculated , with all necessary allowance for the shortness of the notice , to collect young people enough to form twelve or fourteen couple : and could detail the considerations which had induced him to

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	assured	Sir Thomas said no more ; but when they sat down to table the eyes of the two young men assured him that the subject might be gently touched again , when the ladies withdrew , with more success . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	look	To be urging her opinion against Sir Thomas ’s was a proof of the extremity of the case ; but such was her horror at the first suggestion , that she could actually look him in the face and say that she hoped it might be settled otherwise 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	ask	; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be . ” And these were her longest speeches and clearest communications : the rest was only a languid “ Yes , yes ; very well ; did you ? 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	heard	She had burst away from him , and at that moment Sir Thomas was heard speaking to a servant in his way towards the room they were in . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	interrupt	He talked , therefore , for several minutes without Fanny ’s daring to interrupt him . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	accompany	For a moment he ceased , but she had barely become conscious of it , when , rising from his chair , he said , “ And now , Fanny , having performed one part of my commission , and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory , I may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs , where , though I can not but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself , I must submit to your finding one still better worth listening to . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	astonished	There was a look , a start , an exclamation on hearing this , which astonished Sir Thomas ; but what was his increase of astonishment on hearing her exclaim—“Oh ! 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	pleased	I was very much pleased with what I collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion ; it shewed a discretion highly to be commended . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	taken	This can not have taken you by surprise .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	mark	I will , therefore , only add , as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct , that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed , and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what I had supposed . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	shewn	But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse ; that you can and will decide for yourself , without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you , without even asking their advice .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	alarm	Mr. Rushworth had been gone at this time to Bath , to pass a few days with his mother , and bring her back to town , and Maria was with these friends without any restraint , without even Julia ; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Street two or three weeks before , on a visit to some relations of Sir Thomas ; a removal which her father and mother were now disposed to attribute to some view of convenience on Mr. Yates ’s account . Very soon after the Rushworths ’ return to Wimpole Street , Sir Thomas had received a letter from an old and most particular friend in London , who hearing and witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter , wrote to recommend Sir Thomas ’s coming to London himself , and using his influence with his daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already exposing her to unpleasant remarks , and evidently making Mr. Rushworth uneasy . Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter , without communicating its contents to any creature at Mansfield , when it was followed by another , sent express from the same friend , to break to him the almost desperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	met	Tom ’s complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his sister ’s conduct , and his recovery so much thrown back by it , that even Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference , and all her alarms were regularly sent off to her husband ; and Julia ’s elopement , the additional blow which had met him on his arrival in London , though its force had been deadened at the moment , must , she knew , be sorely felt . She saw that it was . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	refusing	Mr. Crawford would have fully acquitted her conduct in refusing him ; but this , though most material to herself , would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	Let	Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour and compassion , and it may all end well ; but if he get his daughter away , it will be destroying the chief hold . ’ 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	reconciling	These were the circumstances and the hopes which gradually brought their alleviation to Sir Thomas , deadening his sense of what was lost , and in part reconciling him to himself ; though the anguish arising from the conviction of his own errors in the education of his daughters was never to be entirely done away . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	marry	She hoped to marry him , and they continued together till she was obliged to be convinced that such hope was vain , and till the disappointment and wretchedness arising from the conviction rendered her temper so bad , and her feelings for him so like hatred , as to make them for a while each other ’s punishment , and then induce a voluntary separation . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	leaving	She had lived with him to be reproached as the ruin of all his happiness in Fanny , and carried away no better consolation in leaving him than that she _ had _ divided them . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	despised	She had despised him , and loved another ; and he had been very much aware that it was so . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	released	_ He _ was released from the engagement to be mortified and unhappy , till some other pretty girl could attract him into matrimony again , and he might set forward on a second , and , it is to be hoped , more prosperous trial of the state : if duped , to be duped at least with good humour and good luck ; while she must withdraw with infinitely stronger feelings to a retirement and reproach which could allow no second spring of hope or character .

Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	placing	She persisted in placing his scruples to _ her _ account , though Sir Thomas very solemnly assured her that , had there been no young woman in question , had there been no young person of either sex belonging to him , to be endangered by the society or hurt by the character of Mrs. Rushworth , he would never have offered so great an insult to the neighbourhood as to expect it to notice her . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	known	Maria had destroyed her own character , and he would not , by a vain attempt to restore what never could be restored , by affording his sanction to vice , or in seeking to lessen its disgrace , be anywise accessory to introducing such misery in another man ’s family as he had known himself . 
Sir Thomas Bertram	patient	convincing	: in every transaction together from that period , in their daily intercourse , in business , or in chat , she had been regularly losing ground in his esteem , and convincing him that either time had done her much disservice , or that he had considerably over - rated her sense , and wonderfully borne with her manners before . 
Mary Crawford	agent	tried	Miss Crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions , though they arose principally from doubts of her sister ’s style of living and tone of society ; and it was not till after she had tried in vain to persuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house , that she could resolve to hazard herself among her other relations .

Mary Crawford	agent	found	Miss Crawford found a sister without preciseness or rusticity , a sister ’s husband who looked the gentleman , and a house commodious and well fitted up ; and Mrs. Grant received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young man and woman of very prepossessing appearance . 
Mary Crawford	agent	knew	Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near them , and not at all displeased either at her sister ’s early care , or the choice it had fallen on . Matrimony was her object , provided she could marry well : and having seen Mr. Bertram in town , she knew that objection could no more be made to his person than to his situation in life .

Mary Crawford	agent	looked	She looked about her with due consideration , and found almost everything in his favour : a park , a real park , five miles round , a spacious modern - built house , so well placed and well screened as to deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen ’s seats in the kingdom , and wanting only to be completely new furnished — pleasant sisters , a quiet mother , and an agreeable man himself — with the advantage of being tied up from much gaming at present by a promise to his father , and of being Sir Thomas hereafter .

Mary Crawford	agent	know	I do not know who or what you mean . 
Mary Crawford	agent	quiz	But I _ will _ quiz you with a great deal of pleasure , if you will tell me what about .

Mary Crawford	agent	retook	on their all dining together at the Park soon after his going , she retook her chosen place near the bottom of the table , fully expecting to feel a most melancholy difference in the change of masters . 
Mary Crawford	agent	try	She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upper end of the table , and in observing Mr. Rushworth , who was now making his appearance at Mansfield for the first time since the Crawfords ’ arrival .

Mary Crawford	agent	living	An uncle with whom she has been living so many years , and who , whatever his faults may be , is so very fond of her brother , treating him , they say , quite like a son . 
Mary Crawford	agent	acquit	I do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements , though the Admiral ’s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife ; but it is natural and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely . 
Mary Crawford	agent	occasioned	The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride , which the former caught , soon after her being settled at Mansfield , from the example of the young ladies at the Park , and which , when Edmund ’s acquaintance with her increased , led to his encouraging the wish , and the offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts , as the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish . 
Mary Crawford	agent	made	Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself , and no inconvenience to Fanny . 
Mary Crawford	agent	know	Miss Crawford ’s enjoyment of riding was such that she did not know how to leave off . 
Mary Crawford	agent	formed	Active and fearless , and though rather small , strongly made , she seemed formed for a horsewoman ; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise , something was probably added in Edmund ’s attendance and instructions , and something more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in general by her early progress , to make her unwilling to dismount .

Mary Crawford	agent	made	At first Miss Crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field , which was not small , at a foot ’s pace ; then , at _ her _ apparent suggestion , they rose into a canter ; and to Fanny ’s timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well she sat .

Mary Crawford	agent	guessed	Miss Crawford was not slow to admire ; she pretty well guessed Miss Bertram ’s feelings , and made it a point of honour to promote her enjoyment to the utmost . Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility ; and even Fanny had something to say in admiration , and might be heard with complacency . Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach ; and after being at some pains to get a view of the house , and observing that “ it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect , ” she added , “ Now , where is the avenue ?

Mary Crawford	agent	perceive	The house fronts the east , I perceive . 
Mary Crawford	agent	seen	Of pictures there were abundance , and some few good , but the larger part were family portraits , no longer anything to anybody but Mrs. Rushworth , who had been at great pains to learn all that the housekeeper could teach , and was now almost equally well qualified to shew the house . On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to Miss Crawford and Fanny , but there was no comparison in the willingness of their attention ; for Miss Crawford , who had seen scores of great houses , and cared for none of them , had only the appearance of civilly listening , while Fanny , to whom everything was almost as interesting as it was new , attended with unaffected earnestness to all that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in former times , its rise and grandeur , regal visits and loyal efforts , delighted to connect anything with history already known , or warm her imagination with scenes of the past .

Mary Crawford	agent	found	Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth ; and when , after a little time , the others began to form into parties , these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund , Miss Crawford , and Fanny , who seemed as naturally to unite , and who , after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties , left them and walked on . 
Mary Crawford	agent	said	“ This is insufferably hot , ” said Miss Crawford , when they had taken one turn on the terrace , and were drawing a second time to the door in the middle which opened to the wilderness . 
Mary Crawford	agent	began	At length , after a short pause , Miss Crawford began with , “ So you are to be a clergyman , Mr. Bertram .

Mary Crawford	agent	seem	There were points on which they did not quite agree ; there were moments in which she did not seem propitious ; and though trusting altogether to her affection , so far as to be resolved — almost resolved — on bringing it to a decision within a very short time , as soon as the variety of business before him were arranged , and he knew what he had to offer her , he had many anxious feelings , many doubting hours as to the result .

Mary Crawford	agent	spoke	Miss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield , and on this circumstance the “ no ” and the “ yes ” had been very recently in alternation .

Mary Crawford	agent	done	for Edmund was so struck with the circumstance , so delighted with what Miss Crawford had done , so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct between them , that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one pleasure over his own mind , though it might have its drawback .

Mary Crawford	agent	given	All went well : she did not dislike her own looks ; and when she came to the necklaces again , her good fortune seemed complete , for upon trial the one given her by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the cross . 
Mary Crawford	agent	had	Miss Crawford had a claim ; and when it was no longer to encroach on , to interfere with the stronger claims , the truer kindness of another 
Mary Crawford	agent	do	, she could do her justice even with pleasure to herself . 
Mary Crawford	agent	listened	Miss Crawford listened ; and all her intended compliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten : she felt only one thing ; and her eyes , bright as they had been before , shewing they could yet be brighter , she exclaimed with eager pleasure , “ Did he ?

Mary Crawford	agent	honour	I honour him beyond expression . ” 
Mary Crawford	agent	saw	Sir Thomas himself was watching her progress down the dance with much complacency ; he was proud of his niece ; and without attributing all her personal beauty , as Mrs. Norris seemed to do , to her transplantation to Mansfield , he was pleased with himself for having supplied everything else : education and manners she owed to him . Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas ’s thoughts as he stood , and having , in spite of all his wrongs towards her , a general prevailing desire of recommending herself to him , took an opportunity of stepping aside to say something agreeable of Fanny . 
Mary Crawford	agent	knew	Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _ her _ by commendation of Fanny ; to her , it was as the occasion offered—“Ah ! ma’am , how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to - night ! ” and Mrs. Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had time for , amid so much occupation as she found for herself in making up card - tables , giving hints to Sir Thomas , and trying to move all the chaperons to a better part of the room .

Mary Crawford	agent	pained	Miss Crawford had been in gay spirits when they first danced together , but it was not her gaiety that could do him good : it rather sank than raised his comfort ; and afterwards , for he found himself still impelled to seek her again , she had absolutely pained him by her manner of speaking of the profession to which he was now on the point of belonging . 
Mary Crawford	agent	ridiculed	They had talked , and they had been silent ; he had reasoned , she had ridiculed ; and they had parted at last with mutual vexation . 
Mary Crawford	agent	sitting	When her two dances with him were over , her inclination and strength for more were pretty well at an end ; and Sir Thomas , having seen her walk rather than dance down the shortening set , breathless , and with her hand at her side , gave his orders for her sitting down entirely . 
Mary Crawford	agent	think	Did she think of being up before you set off ? ” 
Mary Crawford	agent	began	But at last Lady Bertram left the room , and then almost immediately Miss Crawford thus began , with a voice as well regulated as she could—“And how do _ you _ like your cousin Edmund ’s staying away so long ? 
Mary Crawford	agent	consider	Being the only young person at home , I consider _ you _ as the greatest sufferer . 
Mary Crawford	agent	help	He is a very — a very pleasing young man himself , and I can not help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I go to London , as will now undoubtedly be the case .

Mary Crawford	agent	think	Yes ; I think it must be compliments . 
Mary Crawford	agent	thought	if he wrote to his father ; but I thought it might have been to Lady Bertram or you . 
Mary Crawford	agent	said	“ That is the first question , you know , ” said Miss Crawford , trying to appear gay and unconcerned , “ which every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another . 
Mary Crawford	agent	like	I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near . 
Mary Crawford	agent	going	She does not like my going . ” Fanny felt obliged to speak .

Mary Crawford	agent	imagine	But I dare say you know exactly — I always imagine you are — perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all — or not at present . ” 
Mary Crawford	agent	walked	Miss Crawford ’s uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation , and she walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost another week of the same small party in the same bad weather , had they been put to the proof ; but as that very evening brought her brother down from London again in quite , or more than quite , his usual cheerfulness , she had nothing farther to try her own . 
Mary Crawford	agent	meant	” These were not expressions to do Fanny any good ; for though she read in too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss Crawford ’s meaning , it was evident that she meant to compliment her on her brother ’s attachment , and even to _ appear _ to believe it serious . 
Mary Crawford	agent	excuse	The rest of your note I know means nothing ; but I am so unequal to anything of the sort , that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice . 
Mary Crawford	agent	found	The conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright , for she found that Mr. Crawford , under pretence of receiving the note , was coming towards her .

Mary Crawford	agent	desired	That was what she most earnestly desired : go and take his sister with him , as he was to do , and as he returned to Mansfield on purpose to do . 
Mary Crawford	agent	wanted	And why it was not done already she could not devise , for Miss Crawford certainly wanted no delay . 
Mary Crawford	agent	made	Miss Crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother . 
Mary Crawford	agent	meant	She meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time , and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years ’ happy marriage . 
Mary Crawford	agent	made	You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice . ” Still , however , Fanny was oppressed and wearied ; he saw it in her looks , it could not be talked away ; and attempting it no more , he led her directly , with the kind authority of a privileged guardian , into the house . 
Mary Crawford	agent	come	She was safe in the breakfast - room , with her aunt , when Miss Crawford did come ; and the first misery over , and Miss Crawford looking and speaking with much less particularity of expression than she had anticipated , Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse to be endured than a half - hour of moderate agitation . 
Mary Crawford	agent	speak	She was determined to see Fanny alone , and therefore said to her tolerably soon , in a low voice , “ I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere ” ; words that Fanny felt all over her , in all her pulses and all her nerves .

Mary Crawford	agent	overcome	Her disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond treatment , and from having hitherto known so little of it , she was the more overcome by Miss Crawford ’s . 
Mary Crawford	agent	marrying	If she could have believed Mary ’s future fate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother ’s should be , if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant as she was much inclined to think his , she would have been light of heart indeed ; but the more she recollected and observed , the more deeply was she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for Miss Crawford ’s marrying Edmund than it had ever been before . 
Mary Crawford	agent	deserve	love , but she did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment .

Mary Crawford	agent	thought	Whether Mr. Crawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no concern of hers , though , everything considered , she thought he _ would _ go without delay .

Mary Crawford	agent	thought	If Mr. Crawford remembered her message to her cousin , she thought it very likely , most likely , that he would write to her at all events ; it would be most consistent with his usual kindness ; and till she got rid of this idea , till it gradually wore off , by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days more , she was in a most restless , anxious state . 
Mary Crawford	agent	had	Susan was growing very fond of her , and though without any of the early delight in books which had been so strong in Fanny , with a disposition much less inclined to sedentary pursuits , or to information for information ’s sake , she had so strong a desire of not _ appearing _ ignorant , as , with a good clear understanding , made her a most attentive , profitable , thankful pupil . 
Mary Crawford	agent	tell	So very fond of you as Miss Crawford is , it is most natural that she should tell you enough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine . 
Mary Crawford	agent	loves	They are very fond of her ; but I am sure she does not love them as she loves you . 
Mary Crawford	agent	appears	When I think of her great attachment to you , indeed , and the whole of her judicious , upright conduct as a sister , she appears a very different creature , capable of everything noble , and I am ready to blame myself for a too harsh construction of a playful manner . 
Mary Crawford	agent	had	If I did not believe that she had some regard for me 
Mary Crawford	agent	returns	I have sometimes thought of going to London again after Easter , and sometimes resolved on doing nothing till she returns to Mansfield . 
Mary Crawford	agent	speaks	Even now , she speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield in June ; but June is at a great distance , and I believe I shall write to her . 
Mary Crawford	agent	resolves	I shall be able to write much that I could not say , and shall be giving her time for reflection before she resolves on her answer , and I am less afraid of the result of reflection than of an immediate hasty impulse ; I think I am .

Mary Crawford	agent	consulting	My greatest danger would lie in her consulting Mrs. Fraser , and I at a distance unable to help my own cause . 
Mary Crawford	agent	gave	There was not only the debility of recent illness to assist : there was also , as she now learnt , nerves much affected , spirits much depressed to calm and raise , and her own imagination added that there must be a mind to be properly guided . The family were not consumptive , and she was more inclined to hope than fear for her cousin , except when she thought of Miss Crawford ; but Miss Crawford gave her the idea of being the child of good luck , and to her selfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only son . Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten . 
Mary Crawford	agent	hoped	She was only sorry for the parties concerned and for Mansfield , if the report should spread so far ; but she hoped it might not . 
Mary Crawford	agent	said	If the Rushworths were gone themselves to Mansfield , as was to be inferred from what Miss Crawford said , it was not likely that anything unpleasant should have preceded them , or at least should make any impression .

Mary Crawford	agent	reprobated	She reprobated her brother ’s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for , to do what must lose him the woman he adored ; but still more the folly of poor Maria , in sacrificing such a situation , plunging into such difficulties , under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear . 
Mary Crawford	agent	felt	Guess what I must have felt . 
Mary Crawford	agent	say	No reluctance , no horror , no feminine , shall I say , no modest loathings ? 
Mary Crawford	agent	told	She had not waited her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her : she had fixed on Tom Bertram ; the eldest son of a baronet was not too good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds , with all the elegance and accomplishments which Mrs. Grant foresaw in her ; and being a warm - hearted , unreserved woman , Mary had not been three hours in the house before she told her what she had planned .

Mary Crawford	agent	have	I have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn ; and the pains which they , their mothers ( very clever women ) , as well as my dear aunt and myself , have taken to reason , coax , or trick him into marrying , is inconceivable !

Mary Crawford	agent	accepting	Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next , under the conviction that everybody must be wanting to see Sotherton , to include Miss Crawford in the invitation ; and though Mrs. Grant , who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs. Rushworth , on her coming into the neighbourhood , civilly declined it on her own account , she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister ; and Mary , properly pressed and persuaded , was not long in accepting her share of the civility .

Mary Crawford	agent	left	And without attempting any farther remonstrance , she left Fanny to her fate , a fate which , had not Fanny ’s heart been guarded in a way unsuspected by Miss Crawford , might have been a little harder than she deserved ; for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young ladies of eighteen ( or one should not read about them ) as are never to be persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent , manner , attention , and flattery can do , I have no inclination to believe Fanny one of them , or to think that with so much tenderness of disposition , and so much taste as belonged to her , she could have escaped heart - whole from the courtship ( though the courtship only of a fortnight ) of such a man as Crawford , in spite of there being some previous ill opinion of him to be overcome , had not her affection been engaged elsewhere .

Mary Crawford	agent	turned	to greater advantage on the subject than his lady did soon afterwards , when Mary , perceiving her on a sofa very near , turned round before she began to dance , to compliment her on Miss Price ’s looks . 
Mary Crawford	agent	felt	She felt the want of his society every day , almost every hour , and was too much in want of it to derive anything but irritation from considering the object for which he went . 
Mary Crawford	agent	felt	She felt it keenly . 
Mary Crawford	agent	help	Angry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions , and acting on them in defiance of her ( and she had been so angry that they had hardly parted friends at the ball ) , she could not help thinking of him continually when absent , dwelling on his merit and affection , and longing again for the almost daily meetings they lately had .

Mary Crawford	agent	exclaimed	when his sister , who had been waiting for him to walk with her in the garden , met him at last most impatiently in the sweep , and cried out , “ My dear Henry , where can you have been all this time ? ” he had only to say that he had been sitting with Lady Bertram and Fanny . “ Sitting with them an hour and a half ! ” exclaimed Mary . 
Mary Crawford	agent	looked	No : you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price . ” The surprise was now complete ; for , in spite of whatever his consciousness might suggest , a suspicion of his having any such views had never entered his sister ’s imagination ; and she looked so truly the astonishment she felt , that he was obliged to repeat what he had said , and more fully and more solemnly .

Mary Crawford	patient	hazard	Miss Crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions , though they arose principally from doubts of her sister ’s style of living and tone of society ; and it was not till after she had tried in vain to persuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house , that she could resolve to hazard herself among her other relations .

Mary Crawford	patient	assure	But , in general , I can assure you that they are all passed over , and all very ill used . 
Mary Crawford	patient	like	CHAPTER VII “ Well , Fanny , and how do you like Miss Crawford _ now _ ? 
Mary Crawford	patient	like	“ How did you like her yesterday ? ” 
Mary Crawford	patient	misleads	I do not know that her uncle has any claim to her _ gratitude _ ; his wife certainly had ; and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt ’s memory which misleads her here . 
Mary Crawford	patient	justified	There she can not be justified . 
Mary Crawford	patient	come	“ My dear Miss Price , ” said Miss Crawford , as soon as she was at all within hearing , “ I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting ; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself — I knew it was very late , and that I was behaving extremely ill ; and therefore , if you please , you must forgive me . 
Mary Crawford	patient	forgive	“ My dear Miss Price , ” said Miss Crawford , as soon as she was at all within hearing , “ I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting ; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself — I knew it was very late , and that I was behaving extremely ill ; and therefore , if you please , you must forgive me . 
Mary Crawford	patient	bless	Very different from you , miss , when you first began , six years ago come next Easter . Lord bless you ! 
Mary Crawford	patient	celebrated	In the drawing - room Miss Crawford was also celebrated .

Mary Crawford	patient	have	“ I do not want her at all for myself , ” said he ; “ but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home , I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time — for a whole morning , in short . 
Mary Crawford	patient	telling	She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common : Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views , and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it . 
Mary Crawford	patient	include	Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next , under the conviction that everybody must be wanting to see Sotherton , to include Miss Crawford in the invitation ; and though Mrs. Grant , who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs. Rushworth , on her coming into the neighbourhood , civilly declined it on her own account , she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister ; and Mary , properly pressed and persuaded , was not long in accepting her share of the civility . 
Mary Crawford	patient	press	I wish you had my seat , but I dare say you will not take it , let me press you ever so much ; ” 
Mary Crawford	patient	tell	She could not tell Miss Crawford that “ those woods belonged to Sotherton , ” she could not carelessly observe that “ she believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth ’s property on each side of the road , ” without elation of heart ; and it was a pleasure to increase with their approach to the capital freehold mansion , and ancient manorial residence of the family , with all its rights of court - leet and court - baron . “ Now we shall have no more rough road , Miss Crawford ; our difficulties are over . 
Mary Crawford	patient	promote	Miss Crawford was not slow to admire ; she pretty well guessed Miss Bertram ’s feelings , and made it a point of honour to promote her enjoyment to the utmost . Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility ; and even Fanny had something to say in admiration , and might be heard with complacency . Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach ; and after being at some pains to get a view of the house , and observing that “ it was a sort of building which she could not look at but with respect , ” she added , “ Now , where is the avenue ? 
Mary Crawford	patient	pitied	Fanny pitied her . 
Mary Crawford	patient	surprise	“ Why should it surprise you ? 
Mary Crawford	patient	convince	“ I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too . ” “ I do not think you ever will , ” said she , with an arch smile ; “ I am just as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to take orders . 
Mary Crawford	patient	fatigues	“ I must move , ” said she ; “ resting fatigues me . 
Mary Crawford	patient	convince	“ Now , Miss Crawford , if you will look up the walk , you will convince yourself that it can not be half a mile long , or half half a mile . ” 
Mary Crawford	patient	put	“ Do n’t be affronted , ” said she , laughing , “ but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes , who , after performing great exploits in a foreign land , offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return . ” 
Mary Crawford	patient	Thank	“ Thank you for your good word , Fanny , but it is more than I would affirm myself . 
Mary Crawford	patient	justify	clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish — read the newspaper , watch the weather , and quarrel with his wife . His curate does all the work , and the business of his own life is to dine . ” “ There are such clergymen , no doubt , but I think they are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character . 
Mary Crawford	patient	push	“ I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle , ” said Miss Crawford , “ that I can hardly suppose — and since you push me so hard , I must observe , that I am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are , being at this present time the guest of my own brother , Dr. Grant . 
Mary Crawford	patient	driven	To own the truth , Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose , which he could not get the better of . 
Mary Crawford	patient	interest	After continuing in chat with the party round the fire a few minutes , Miss Crawford returned to the party round the table ; and standing by them , seemed to interest herself in their arrangements till , as if struck by a sudden recollection , she exclaimed , “ My good friends , you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses , inside and out ; but pray let me know my fate in the meanwhile . 
Mary Crawford	patient	want	“ They do not want me at all , ” said she , seating herself . 
Mary Crawford	patient	seating	“ They do not want me at all , ” said she , seating herself . 
Mary Crawford	patient	silenced	Miss Crawford was silenced , and with some feelings of resentment and mortification , moved her chair considerably nearer the tea - table , and gave all her attention to Mrs. Norris , who was presiding there . 
Mary Crawford	patient	placed	Edmund was too angry to speak ; but Miss Crawford , looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris , and then at Fanny , whose tears were beginning to shew themselves , immediately said , with some keenness , “ I do not like my situation : this _ place _ is too hot for me , ” and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table , close to Fanny , saying to her , in a kind , low whisper , as she placed herself , “ Never mind , my dear Miss Price , this is a cross evening : everybody is cross and teasing , but do not let us mind them ” ; 
Mary Crawford	patient	love	Fanny did not love Miss Crawford ; but she felt very much obliged to her for her present kindness ; 
Mary Crawford	patient	concerned	After a moment ’s thought , Miss Crawford calmly replied , “ As far as I am concerned , I can have no objection to anything that you all think eligible . 
Mary Crawford	patient	Put	Put yourself in Miss Crawford ’s place , Fanny . 
Mary Crawford	patient	known	“ I am sorry for Miss Crawford ; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against , and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle . 
Mary Crawford	patient	brought	Surprise , consciousness , and pleasure appeared in each of the three on this unexpected meeting ; and as Edmund was come on the very same business that had brought Miss Crawford , consciousness and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in _ them _ . 
Mary Crawford	patient	applied	Why was not Miss Crawford to be applied to as well ? 
Mary Crawford	patient	leave	“ Where did you leave Miss Crawford , Fanny ? ” 
Mary Crawford	patient	betray	I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country ; and November is a still more serious month , and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on . ” Fanny could have said a great deal , but it was safer to say nothing , and leave untouched all Miss Crawford ’s resources — her accomplishments , her spirits , her importance , her friends , lest it should betray her into any observations seemingly unhandsome . 
Mary Crawford	patient	seeing	“ To say the truth , ” replied Miss Crawford , “ I am something like the famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV . ; and may declare that I see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it . 
Mary Crawford	patient	told	If anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home , that I should be spending month after month here , as I have done , I certainly should not have believed them . 
Mary Crawford	patient	Commend	“ Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer . ” 
Mary Crawford	patient	pushing	There are his own two men pushing it back into its old quarters . 
Mary Crawford	patient	checked	” Miss Crawford _ could _ have said that there would be a something to do and to suffer for it , which she could not think lightly of ; but she checked herself and let it pass ; and tried to look calm and unconcerned 
Mary Crawford	patient	soothed	With that she soothed herself and amused her friend . 
Mary Crawford	patient	pay	” The game was hers , and only did not pay her for what she had given to secure it . 
Mary Crawford	patient	Excuse	( Excuse me , your ladyship must not see your cards . 
Mary Crawford	patient	knowing	was not always perfectly assured of knowing Miss Crawford ’s . 
Mary Crawford	patient	offer	There were points on which they did not quite agree ; there were moments in which she did not seem propitious ; and though trusting altogether to her affection , so far as to be resolved — almost resolved — on bringing it to a decision within a very short time , as soon as the variety of business before him were arranged , and he knew what he had to offer her , he had many anxious feelings , many doubting hours as to the result . 
Mary Crawford	patient	convey	Miss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield , and on this circumstance the “ no ” and the “ yes ” had been very recently in alternation . He had seen her eyes sparkle as she spoke of the dear friend ’s letter , which claimed a long visit from her in London , and of the kindness of Henry , in engaging to remain where he was till January , that he might convey her thither ; he had heard her speak of the pleasure of such a journey with an animation which had “ no ” in every tone . 
Mary Crawford	patient	express	He had since heard her express herself differently , with other feelings , more chequered feelings : he had heard her tell Mrs. Grant that she should leave her with regret ; that she began to believe neither the friends nor the pleasures she was going to were worth those she left behind ; and that though she felt she must go , and knew she should enjoy herself when once away , she was already looking forward to being at Mansfield again . Was there not a “ yes ” in all this ?

Was there not a “ yes ” in all this ? 
Mary Crawford	patient	engage	To engage her early for the two first dances was all the command of individual happiness which he felt in his power , and the only preparation for the ball which he could enter into , in spite of all that was passing around him on the subject , from morning till night . 
Mary Crawford	patient	met	and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton , and she had reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out , she walked down to the Parsonage without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private discussion ; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important part of it to Fanny , being more than half - ashamed of her own solicitude . She met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage , just setting out to call on her , and as it seemed to her that her friend , though obliged to insist on turning back , was unwilling to lose her walk , she explained her business at once , and observed , that if she would be so kind as to give her opinion , it might be all talked over as well without doors as within . 
Mary Crawford	patient	answered	She was answered by having a small trinket - box placed before her , and being requested to chuse from among several gold chains and necklaces . 
Mary Crawford	patient	oblige	You must forgive the liberty , and oblige me . ” Fanny still resisted , and from her heart . 
Mary Crawford	patient	convince	“ Well , then , ” replied Miss Crawford more seriously , but without at all believing her , “ to convince me that you suspect no trick , and are as unsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you , take the necklace and say no more about it . 
Mary Crawford	patient	marry	He would marry Miss Crawford . 
Mary Crawford	patient	engage	“ I wished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances , ” was the explanation that followed , and brought Fanny to life again , enabling her , as she found she was expected to speak , to utter something like an inquiry as to the result . 
Mary Crawford	patient	blinded	You are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said ; but you have always known my opinion of her ; you can bear me witness , Fanny , that I have never been blinded . 
Mary Crawford	patient	fear	You need not fear me ; I have almost given up 
Mary Crawford	patient	befell	every serious idea of her ; but I must be a blockhead indeed , if , whatever befell me , I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude . ” He had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen . 
Mary Crawford	patient	wearing	His , therefore , must be worn ; and having , with delightful feelings , joined the chain and the cross — those memorials of the two most beloved of her heart , those dearest tokens so formed for each other by everything real and imaginary — and put them round her neck , and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were , she was able , without an effort , to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford ’s necklace too . 
Mary Crawford	patient	do	, she could do her justice even with pleasure to herself . 
Mary Crawford	patient	seek	Miss Crawford had been in gay spirits when they first danced together , but it was not her gaiety that could do him good : it rather sank than raised his comfort ; and afterwards , for he found himself still impelled to seek her again , she had absolutely pained him by her manner of speaking of the profession to which he was now on the point of belonging . 
Mary Crawford	patient	visit	“ Poor Fanny ! ” cried William , coming for a moment to visit her , and working away his partner ’s fan as if for life , “ how soon she is knocked up ! 
Mary Crawford	patient	knocked	“ Poor Fanny ! ” cried William , coming for a moment to visit her , and working away his partner ’s fan as if for life , “ how soon she is knocked up ! 
Mary Crawford	patient	detain	I am looking for Henry every day , and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield . 
Mary Crawford	patient	compliment	But I am not fishing ; do n’t compliment me . 
Mary Crawford	patient	discovered	I may be discovered by those who want to see me . 
Mary Crawford	patient	see	I may be discovered by those who want to see me . 
Mary Crawford	patient	tell	His still refusing to tell her what he had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety ; a day before it might have irritated , but now it was a pleasant joke — suspected only of concealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself . 
Mary Crawford	patient	begging	The rest of your note I know means nothing ; but I am so unequal to anything of the sort , that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice . 
Mary Crawford	patient	hurry	“ You can not think I mean to hurry you , ” said he , in an undervoice , perceiving the amazing trepidation with which she made up the note , “ you can not think I have any such object . 
Mary Crawford	patient	hurry	Do not hurry yourself , I entreat . ” 
Mary Crawford	patient	thank	I thank you ; I have quite done , just done ; it will be ready in a moment ; I am very much obliged to you ; if you will be so good as to give _ that _ to Miss Crawford 
Mary Crawford	patient	avoid	His absence had been extended beyond a fortnight purposely to avoid Miss Crawford . 
Mary Crawford	patient	see	Her reception of him was of a sort which he could not have hoped for , had he expected to see her . 
Mary Crawford	patient	avoiding	His avoiding her was quite at an end . 
Mary Crawford	patient	saw	“ It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford . ” 
Mary Crawford	patient	loved	She cried as if she had loved Miss Crawford more than she possibly could ; and Miss Crawford , yet farther softened by the sight of such emotion , hung about her with fondness , and said , “ I hate to leave you . 
Mary Crawford	patient	convince	I feel that we are born to be connected ; and those tears convince me that you feel it too , dear Fanny . ” 
Mary Crawford	patient	seeing	Either his going had been again delayed , or he had yet procured no opportunity of seeing Miss Crawford alone , or he was too happy for letter - writing ! 
Mary Crawford	patient	proving	The idea that returned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford , after proving herself cooled and staggered by a return to London habits , would yet prove herself in the end too much attached to him to give him up . 
Mary Crawford	patient	remembered	If Mr. Crawford remembered her message to her cousin , she thought it very likely , most likely , that he would write to her at all events ; it would be most consistent with his usual kindness ; and till she got rid of this idea , till it gradually wore off , by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days more , she was in a most restless , anxious state .

Mary Crawford	patient	wear	Suspense must be submitted to , and must not be allowed to wear her out , and make her useless . 
Mary Crawford	patient	saw	I was three weeks in London , and saw her ( for London ) very often . 
Mary Crawford	patient	see	Had she been different when I did see her , I should have made no complaint , but from the very first she was altered 
Mary Crawford	patient	altered	Had she been different when I did see her , I should have made no complaint , but from the very first she was altered 
Mary Crawford	patient	leading	leading her astray for years . 
Mary Crawford	patient	detached	Could she be detached from them!—and sometimes I do not despair of it , for the affection appears to me principally on their side . 
Mary Crawford	patient	give	I can not give her up , Fanny . 
Mary Crawford	patient	lose	I could better bear to lose her because not rich enough , than because of my profession . 
Mary Crawford	patient	give	I can not give her up . 
Mary Crawford	patient	thanked	She thanked Miss Crawford , but gave a decided negative . 
Mary Crawford	patient	seen	He had seen Miss Crawford . 
Mary Crawford	patient	see	He had been invited to see her . 
Mary Crawford	patient	investing	He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call ; and regarding it as what was meant to be the last , last interview of friendship , and investing her with all the feelings of shame and wretchedness which Crawford ’s sister ought to have known , he had gone to her in such a state of mind , so softened , so devoted , as made it for a few moments impossible to Fanny ’s fears that it should be the last . 
Mary Crawford	patient	told	She had not waited her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her : she had fixed on Tom Bertram ; the eldest son of a baronet was not too good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds , with all the elegance and accomplishments which Mrs. Grant foresaw in her ; and being a warm - hearted , unreserved woman , Mary had not been three hours in the house before she told her what she had planned . 
Mary Crawford	patient	find	“ My dear sister , ” said Mary , “ if you can persuade him into anything of the sort , it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever , and I shall only regret that you have 
Mary Crawford	patient	said	“ Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home , ” said Mary , after a pause . 
Mary Crawford	patient	blame	Then she began to blame herself . 
Mary Crawford	patient	consider	Being the only young person at home , I consider _ you _ as the greatest sufferer . 
Mary Crawford	patient	surprise	Does his staying longer surprise you ? ” 
Mary Crawford	patient	astonish	Will it astonish you ? 
Mary Crawford	patient	tell	But tell me all about it ! 
Mary Crawford	patient	love	Were you even less pleasing — supposing her not to love you already ( of which , however , I can have little doubt)—you would be safe . 
Mary Crawford	patient	marry	From my soul I do not think she would marry you _ without _ love ; that is , if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition 
Mary Crawford	patient	love	, I can suppose it her ; but ask her to love you , and she will never have the heart to refuse . 
Mary Crawford	patient	recollected	When she had spoken it , she recollected herself , and wished it unsaid ; but there was no need of confusion ; for her brother saw her only as the supposed inmate of Mansfield parsonage , and replied but to invite her in the kindest manner to his own house , and to claim the best right in her .

Mary Crawford	patient	delights	It quite delights me . 
Mary Crawford	patient	gone	And the other , that you will often call on Mrs. Grant , and make her amends for my being gone . 
Mary Crawford	patient	taken	It was the gift of her good godmother , old Mrs. Admiral Maxwell , only six weeks before she was taken for death . 
Mary Crawford	patient	taken	Well , she was taken away from evil to come . 
Mary Crawford	patient	tell	Shall I tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was mentioned ? 
Mary Crawford	patient	spoken	Upon the whole , Julia was in the best looks of the two , at least after you were spoken of . 
Mary Crawford	patient	seeing	By the time he had given all this information , it was not unreasonable to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to ; and she was tolerably able to bear his eye , and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving London ; that she had sent her best and kindest love , but had had no time for writing ; that he thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour , having spent scarcely twenty - four hours in London , after his return from Norfolk , before he set off again ; that her cousin Edmund was in town , had been in town , he understood , a few days ; that he had not seen him himself , but that he was well , had left them all well at Mansfield , and was to dine , as yesterday , with the Frasers . 
Mary Crawford	patient	consider	The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of Fanny . 
Mary Crawford	patient	keep	Happily , however , she was not left to weigh and decide between opposite inclinations and doubtful notions of right ; there was no occasion to determine whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not . 
Mary Crawford	patient	marrying	Would he have persevered , and uprightly , Fanny must have been his reward , and a reward very voluntarily bestowed , within a reasonable period from Edmund ’s marrying Mary . 
Mary Crawford	patient	had	Mrs. Grant , with a temper to love and be loved , must have gone with some regret from the scenes and people she had been used to ; but the same happiness of disposition must in any place , and any society , secure her a great deal to enjoy , and she had again a home to offer Mary ; and Mary had had enough of her own friends , enough of vanity , ambition , love , and disappointment in the course of the last half - year , to be in need of the true kindness of her sister ’s heart , and the rational tranquillity of her ways . 
Mary Crawford	patient	attaching	Mary , though perfectly resolved against ever attaching herself to a younger brother again , was long in finding among the dashing representatives , or idle heir - apparents , who were at the command of her beauty , and her £ 20,000 , any one who could satisfy the better taste she had acquired at Mansfield , whose character and manners could authorise a hope of the domestic happiness she had there learned to estimate , or put Edmund Bertram sufficiently out of her head . 
Mary Crawford	patient	succeed	He had not to wait and wish with vacant affections for an object worthy to succeed her in them . 
Mary Crawford	patient	regretting	Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford , and observing to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such another woman , before it began to strike him whether a very different kind of woman might not do just as well , or a great deal better : whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear , as important to him in all her smiles and all her ways , as Mary Crawford had ever been ; and whether it might not be a possible , a hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love . I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion , that every one may be at liberty to fix their own , aware that the cure of unconquerable passions , and the transfer of unchanging attachments , must vary much as to time in different people . 
Henry Crawford	agent	mean	Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger ! 
Henry Crawford	agent	began	the Miss Bertrams were worth pleasing , and were ready to be pleased ; and he began with no object but of making them like him .

Henry Crawford	agent	doing	Mr. Crawford , after properly depreciating his own abilities , was quite at his service in any way that could be useful . Mr. Rushworth then began to propose Mr. Crawford ’s doing him the honour of coming over to Sotherton , and taking a bed there ; when Mrs. Norris , as if reading in her two nieces ’ minds their little approbation of a plan which was to take Mr. Crawford away , interposed with an amendment . “ There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford ’s willingness ; but why should not more of us go ? 
Henry Crawford	agent	take	I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche , and Edmund can go on horseback , you know , sister , and Fanny will stay at home with you .

Henry Crawford	agent	saved	She could not but think , indeed , that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved him the trouble ; that it would have been particularly proper and becoming in a brother to have done it himself ; but Mr. Crawford , with all his boasted good - nature , and all his coachmanship , probably knew nothing of the matter , and had no active kindness in comparison of Edmund .

Henry Crawford	agent	depends	“ Besides , ” said Maria , “ I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us . 
Henry Crawford	agent	claim	After what passed at first , he would claim it as a promise . ” 
Henry Crawford	agent	driving	Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangement which restored him to his share of the party ; and Mrs. Norris thought it an excellent plan , and had it at her tongue ’s end , and was on the point of proposing it , when Mrs. Grant spoke . Wednesday was fine , and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived , Mr. Crawford driving his sisters ; and as everybody was ready , there was nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take their places . 
Henry Crawford	agent	sitting	For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort : her prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side by side , full of conversation and merriment ; and to see only his expressive profile as he turned with a smile to Julia , or to catch the laugh of the other , was a perpetual source of irritation , which her own sense of propriety could but just smooth over .

Henry Crawford	agent	give	Starting , the lady instinctively moved a step or two , but recovering herself in a moment , affected to laugh , and asked him , in a tone not much louder , “ If he would give her away ? 
Henry Crawford	agent	do	“ I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly , ” was his reply , with a look of meaning . 
Henry Crawford	agent	said	“ Query , ” said Mr. Crawford , looking round him , “ whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther ? 
Henry Crawford	agent	see	I see walls of great promise . 
Henry Crawford	agent	said	“ It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now , as we are so far from the house already , ” said Mr. Crawford , when he was gone . 
Henry Crawford	agent	said	At the same moment Mr. Crawford , approaching Julia , said , “ I hope I am not to lose my companion , unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat . ” The request had not been foreseen , but was very graciously received , and Julia ’s day was likely to end almost as well as it began .

Henry Crawford	agent	went	He went for a fortnight — a fortnight of such dullness to the Miss Bertrams as ought to have put them both on their guard , and made even Julia admit , in her jealousy of her sister , the absolute necessity of distrusting his attentions , and wishing him not to return ; and a fortnight of sufficient leisure , in the intervals of shooting and sleeping , to have convinced the gentleman that he ought to keep longer away , had he been more in the habit of examining his own motives , and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity was tending ; but , thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad example , he would not look beyond the present moment .

Henry Crawford	agent	returned	The sisters , handsome , clever , and encouraging , were an amusement to his sated mind ; and finding nothing in Norfolk to equal the social pleasures of Mansfield , he gladly returned to it at the time appointed , and was welcomed thither quite as gladly by those whom he came to trifle with further .

Henry Crawford	agent	growing	He is growing extremely particular in his attentions . ” 
Henry Crawford	agent	desired	Mr. Crawford desired _ that _ might not be thought of : he was very sure his sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful , and that she would not allow herself to be considered in the present case . 
Henry Crawford	agent	backed	Her entreaty had no effect on Tom : he only said again what he had said before ; and it was not merely Tom , for the requisition was now backed by Maria , and Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Yates , with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious , and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny ; and before she could breathe after it , Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you ! 
Henry Crawford	agent	had	As far as she could judge , Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor of all : he had more confidence than Edmund , more judgment than Tom , more talent and taste than Mr. Yates . 
Henry Crawford	agent	remembering	As to his ever making anything _ tolerable _ of them , nobody had the smallest idea of that except his mother ; _ she _ , indeed , regretted that his part was not more considerable , and deferred coming over to Mansfield till they were forward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his scenes ; but the others aspired at nothing beyond his remembering the catchword , and the first line of his speech , and being able to follow the prompter through the rest . 
Henry Crawford	agent	lose	It was of the utmost consequence to her that Crawford should now lose no time in declaring himself , and she was disturbed that even a day should be gone by without seeming to advance that point . 
Henry Crawford	agent	going	Sir Thomas had been quite indifferent to Mr. Crawford ’s going or staying : but his good wishes for Mr. Yates ’s having a pleasant journey , as he walked with him to the hall - door , were given with genuine satisfaction .

Henry Crawford	agent	see	I see him now — his toil and his despair . 
Henry Crawford	agent	addressed	her tranquillity remained undisturbed the rest of the evening , except when Mr. Crawford now and then addressed to her a question or observation , which she could not avoid answering . 
Henry Crawford	agent	intended	that he could relate of his own horsemanship in various countries , of the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged , the rough horses and mules he had ridden , or his many narrow escapes from dreadful falls , that he was at all equal to the management of a high - fed hunter in an English fox - chase ; nor till he returned safe and well , without accident or discredit , could she be reconciled to the risk , or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the horse which he had fully intended it should produce . 
Henry Crawford	agent	remained	it was proved , however , to have done William no harm , she could allow it to be a kindness , and even reward the owner with a smile when the animal was one minute tendered to his use again ; and the next , with the greatest cordiality , and in a manner not to be resisted , made over to his use entirely so long as he remained in Northamptonshire . 
Henry Crawford	agent	does	I am never to see my cards ; and Mr. Crawford does all the rest . ”

Henry Crawford	agent	seen	“ Have you ever seen the place ? ” 
Henry Crawford	agent	pursued	Fanny gave a quick negative , and tried to hide her interest in the subject by an eager attention to her brother , who was driving as hard a bargain , and imposing on her as much as he could ; but Crawford pursued with “ No , no , you must not part with the queen .

Henry Crawford	agent	engaging	brought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her , and her thoughts were put into another channel by his engaging her almost instantly for the first two dances . 
Henry Crawford	agent	asked	To be secure of a partner at first was a most essential good — for the moment of beginning was now growing seriously near ; and she so little understood her own claims as to think that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her , she must have been the last to be sought after , and should have received a partner only through a series of inquiry , and bustle , and interference , which would have been terrible ; but at the same time there was a pointedness in his manner of asking her which she did not like , and she saw his eye glancing for a moment at her necklace , with a smile — she thought there was a smile — which made her blush and feel wretched . 
Henry Crawford	agent	perceiving	And though there was no second glance to disturb her , though his object seemed then to be only quietly agreeable , she could not get the better of her embarrassment , heightened as it was by the idea of his perceiving it , and had no composure till he turned away to some one else .

Henry Crawford	agent	conducted	; in vain , however : Sir Thomas smiled , tried to encourage her , and then looked too serious , and said too decidedly , “ It must be so , my dear , ” for her to hazard another word ; and she found herself the next moment conducted by Mr. Crawford to the top of the room , and standing there to be joined by the rest of the dancers , couple after couple , as they were formed . She could hardly believe it . 
Henry Crawford	agent	admired	She was attractive , she was modest , she was Sir Thomas ’s niece , and she was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford . 
Henry Crawford	agent	sat	From that time Mr. Crawford sat down likewise . 
Henry Crawford	agent	call	Mr. Crawford , I think you call for him at half - past nine ? ” 
Henry Crawford	agent	said	“ Yes , half - past nine , ” said Crawford to William as the latter was leaving them , “ and I shall be punctual , for there will be no kind sister to get up for _ me _ . ” 
Henry Crawford	agent	have	And in a lower tone to Fanny , “ I shall have only a desolate house to hurry from . 
Henry Crawford	agent	confess	After a short consideration , Sir Thomas asked Crawford to join the early breakfast party in that house instead of eating alone : he should himself be of it ; and the readiness with which his invitation was accepted convinced him that the suspicions whence , he must confess to himself , this very ball had in great measure sprung , were well founded . 
Henry Crawford	agent	had	He had a pleasing anticipation of what would be . 
Henry Crawford	agent	foretold	Mr. Crawford had , as he foretold , been very punctual , and short and pleasant had been the meal . 
Henry Crawford	agent	address	Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her so again : he must have seen how unwelcome it was to her ; and in that case , how gratefully she could esteem him for his friendship to William ! 
Henry Crawford	agent	think	This was a most unwelcome hearing , for though he might think nothing of what had passed , it would be quite distressing to her to see him again so soon . 
Henry Crawford	agent	had	He had a note to deliver from his sister . 
Henry Crawford	agent	spoke	She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her , and he spoke to her much too often ; and she was afraid there was a something in his voice and manner in addressing her very different from what they were when he talked to the others .

Henry Crawford	agent	sat	, she was ready to sink with shame , from the dread of Mr. Crawford ’s interpretation ; for though nothing could have tempted her to turn her eyes to the right hand , where he sat , she felt that _ his _ were immediately directed towards her . 
Henry Crawford	agent	joined	She had quite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas and Mr. Crawford joined them .

Henry Crawford	agent	had	The note was held out , and must be taken ; and as she instantly and with averted eyes walked towards the fireplace , where sat the others , he had nothing to do but to go in good earnest . Fanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation , both of pain and pleasure ; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to die with the day ; for every day would restore the knowledge of William ’s advancement , whereas the pain , she hoped , would return no more . 
Henry Crawford	agent	go	If Mr. Crawford would but go away ! 
Henry Crawford	agent	returned	That was what she most earnestly desired : go and take his sister with him , as he was to do , and as he returned to Mansfield on purpose to do . 
Henry Crawford	agent	spoken	Fanny had hoped , in the course of his yesterday ’s visit , to hear the day named ; but he had only spoken of their journey as what would take place ere long . Having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note would convey , she could not but be astonished to see Mr. Crawford , as she accidentally did , coming up to the house again , and at an hour as early as the day before . His coming might have nothing to do with her , but she must avoid seeing him if possible ; and being then on her way upstairs , she resolved there to remain , during the whole of his visit , unless actually sent for ; and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house , there seemed little danger of her being wanted . 
Henry Crawford	agent	come	She sat some time in a good deal of agitation , listening , trembling , and fearing to be sent for every moment ; but as no footsteps approached the East room , she grew gradually composed , could sit down , and be able to employ herself , and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come and would go without her being obliged to know anything of the matter .

Henry Crawford	agent	done	Fanny ’s colour grew deeper and deeper ; and her uncle , perceiving that she was embarrassed to a degree that made either speaking or looking up quite impossible , turned away his own eyes , and without any farther pause proceeded in his account of Mr. Crawford ’s visit . Mr. Crawford ’s business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny , make decided proposals for her , and entreat the sanction of the uncle , who seemed to stand in the place of her parents ; and he had done it all so well , so openly , so liberally , so properly , that Sir Thomas , feeling , moreover , his own replies , and his own remarks to have been very much to the purpose , was exceedingly happy to give the particulars of their conversation ; and little aware of what was passing in his niece ’s mind , conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her far more than himself . 
Henry Crawford	agent	know	Mr. Crawford ought to know — he must know that : 
Henry Crawford	agent	spoke	I told him enough yesterday to convince him ; he spoke to me on this subject yesterday , and I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me , and quite out of my power to return his good opinion . ”

Henry Crawford	agent	gone	It was over , however , at last ; and the evening set in with more composure to Fanny , and more cheerfulness of spirits than she could have hoped for after so stormy a morning ; but she trusted , in the first place , that she had done right : that her judgment had not misled her . For the purity of her intentions she could answer ; and she was willing to hope , secondly , that her uncle ’s displeasure was abating , and would abate farther as he considered the matter with more impartiality , and felt , as a good man must feel , how wretched , and how unpardonable , how hopeless , and how wicked it was to marry without affection . When the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past , she could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally concluded , and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield , that everything would soon be as if no such subject had existed . 
Henry Crawford	agent	learn	In London he would soon learn to wonder at his infatuation , and be thankful for the right reason in her which had saved him from its evil consequences . While Fanny ’s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes , her uncle was , soon after tea , called out of the room ; an occurrence too common to strike her , and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared ten minutes afterwards , and advancing decidedly towards herself , said , “ Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you , ma’am , in his own room . ”

Henry Crawford	agent	called	Crawford called the next day , and on the score of Edmund ’s return , Sir Thomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner ; it was really a necessary compliment . 
Henry Crawford	agent	walked	When he and Crawford walked into the drawing - room , his mother and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if there were nothing else to care for .

Henry Crawford	agent	proceeded	Edmund had already gone through the service once since his ordination ; and upon this being understood , he had a variety of questions from Crawford as to his feelings and success ; questions , which being made , though with the vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste , without any touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew to be most offensive to Fanny , he had true pleasure in satisfying ; and when Crawford proceeded to ask his opinion and give his own as to the properest manner in which particular passages in the service should be delivered , shewing it to be a subject on which he had thought before , and thought with judgment , Edmund was still more and more pleased .

Henry Crawford	agent	observed	“ Our liturgy , ” observed Crawford , “ has beauties , which not even a careless , slovenly style of reading can destroy ; but it has also redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt .

Henry Crawford	agent	persisting	Fanny , meanwhile , vexed with herself for not having been as motionless as she was speechless , and grieved to the heart to see Edmund ’s arrangements , was trying by everything in the power of her modest , gentle nature , to repulse Mr. Crawford , and avoid both his looks and inquiries ; and he , unrepulsable , was persisting in both .

Henry Crawford	agent	admired	And , Fanny , though I hope I do justice to my sisters ’ good qualities , I think it very possible that they might , one or both , be more desirous of being admired by Crawford , and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent . 
Henry Crawford	agent	has	Next to your happiness , Fanny , his has the first claim on me . 
Henry Crawford	agent	came	Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity . ” “ Was Mrs. Grant in the room , then ? ” “ Yes , when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in . 
Henry Crawford	agent	has	But , even supposing it is so , allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has , how was I to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own ? 
Henry Crawford	agent	took	He took me wholly by surprise . 
Henry Crawford	agent	taking	I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning ; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me . 
Henry Crawford	agent	meant	I am sure his sisters , rating him as they do , must have thought it so , supposing he had meant nothing . 
Henry Crawford	agent	said	How , then , was I to be — to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me ? 
Henry Crawford	agent	amused	I could not but see that Mr. Crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing . ” 
Henry Crawford	agent	making	He has now and then been a sad flirt , and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies ’ affections .

Henry Crawford	agent	gone	Mr. Crawford gone , Sir Thomas ’s next object was that he should be missed ; and he entertained great hope that his niece would find a blank in the loss of those attentions which at the time she had felt , or fancied , an evil . 
Henry Crawford	agent	forgotten	She had reason to suppose herself not yet forgotten by Mr. Crawford . 
Henry Crawford	agent	walked	It was a gentleman ’s voice ; it was a voice that Fanny was just turning pale about , when Mr. Crawford walked into the room .

Henry Crawford	agent	began	After talking a little more about Mansfield , a subject in which her interest was most apparent , Crawford began to hint at the expediency of an early walk . 
Henry Crawford	agent	give	He must soon give her up , and cease to have the smallest inclination for the match ; and yet , though she had been so much wanting his affection to be cured , this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as the complaint ; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever , agreeable man , than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations .

Henry Crawford	agent	regard	Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his future father - in - law with any idea of taking him for a model in dress ; but ( as Fanny instantly , and to her great relief , discerned ) her father was a very different man , a very different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly respected stranger , from what he was in his own family at home . 
Henry Crawford	agent	wished	Crawford could not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down ; but he could have wished her sister away . 
Henry Crawford	agent	content	He must content himself with being only generally agreeable , and letting Susan have her share of entertainment , with the indulgence , now and then , of a look or hint for the better - informed and conscious Fanny . 
Henry Crawford	agent	had	what he had mostly to talk of 
Henry Crawford	agent	going	For her approbation , the particular reason of his going into Norfolk at all , at this unusual time of year , was given . 
Henry Crawford	agent	believed	It had been real business , relative to the renewal of a lease in which the welfare of a large and — he believed — industrious family was at stake .

Henry Crawford	agent	mentioned	Now so long divided from everybody who knew the place , she felt it quite the voice of a friend when he mentioned it , and led the way to her fond exclamations in praise of its beauties and comforts , and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed her to gratify her own heart in the warmest eulogium , in speaking of her uncle as all that was clever and good , and her aunt as having the sweetest of all sweet tempers .

Henry Crawford	agent	contrived	, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute ’s privacy for telling Fanny that his only business in Portsmouth was to see her ; that he was come down for a couple of days on her account , and hers only , and because he could not endure a longer total separation . She was sorry , really sorry ; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said , she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him ; he was much more gentle , obliging , and attentive to other people ’s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield ; she had never seen him so agreeable — so _ near _ being agreeable ; his behaviour to her father could not offend , and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of Susan .

She was sorry , really sorry ; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said , she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him ; he was much more gentle , obliging , and attentive to other people ’s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield ; she had never seen him so agreeable — so _ near _ being agreeable ; his behaviour to her father could not offend , and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of Susan .

Henry Crawford	agent	take	She had a few tender reveries now and then , which he could sometimes take advantage of to look in her face without detection ; and the result of these looks was , that though as bewitching as ever , her face was less blooming than it ought to be . 
Henry Crawford	agent	growing	She _ said _ she was very well , and did not like to be supposed otherwise ; but take it all in all , he was convinced that her present residence could not be comfortable , and therefore could not be salutary for her , and he was growing anxious for her being again at Mansfield , where her own happiness , and his in seeing her , must be so much greater .

Henry Crawford	agent	travelling	CHAPTER XLIII It was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back , to London , on the morrow , for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price ’s ; and two days afterwards , it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letter from his sister , opened and read by her , on another account , with the most anxious curiosity : 
Henry Crawford	agent	went	Whether Mr. Crawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no concern of hers , though , everything considered , she thought he _ would _ go without delay . 
Henry Crawford	agent	remembered	If Mr. Crawford remembered her message to her cousin , she thought it very likely , most likely , that he would write to her at all events ; it would be most consistent with his usual kindness ; and till she got rid of this idea , till it gradually wore off , by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days more , she was in a most restless , anxious state . 
Henry Crawford	agent	entering	She thought he was really good - tempered , and could fancy his entering into a plan of that sort most pleasantly . 
Henry Crawford	agent	told	Crawford told me that you were wishing to hear from me , but I found it impossible to write from London , and persuaded myself that you would understand my silence . 
Henry Crawford	agent	knows	He thoroughly knows his own mind , and acts up to his resolutions : an inestimable quality . 
Henry Crawford	agent	draw	I saw him draw back surprised , and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any former supposed slight to Miss Bertram . 
Henry Crawford	agent	gone	It was weeks since she had heard anything of Miss Crawford or of her other connexions in town , except through Mansfield , and she was beginning to suppose that she might never know whether Mr. Crawford had gone into Norfolk again or not till they met , and might never hear from his sister any more this spring , when the following letter was received to revive old and create some new sensations — “ Forgive me , my dear Fanny , as soon as you can , for my long silence , and behave as if you could forgive me directly .

Henry Crawford	agent	proposed	Nothing was fixed on ; but Henry Crawford was full of ideas and projects , and , generally speaking , whatever he proposed was immediately approved , first by her , and then by Mr. Rushworth , whose principal business seemed to be to hear the others , and who scarcely risked an original thought of his own beyond a wish that they had seen his friend Smith ’s place 
Henry Crawford	agent	entered	Edmund had little to hope , but he was still urging the subject when Henry Crawford entered the room , fresh from the Parsonage , calling out , “ No want of hands in our theatre , Miss Bertram . 
Henry Crawford	agent	turning	Henry Crawford , who meanwhile had taken up the play , and with seeming carelessness was turning over the first act , 
Henry Crawford	agent	said	It could make no difference in the play , and as for Cottager himself , when he has got his wife ’s speeches , _ I _ would undertake him with all my heart . ” “ With all your partiality for Cottager ’s wife , ” said Henry Crawford , “ it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister , and we must not suffer her good - nature to be imposed on .

Henry Crawford	agent	looked	She stopped — Henry Crawford looked rather foolish , and as if he did not know what to say . 
Henry Crawford	agent	conversed	A short silence succeeded her leaving them ; but her brother soon returned to business and Lovers ’ Vows , and was eagerly looking over the play , with Mr. Yates ’s help , to ascertain what scenery would be necessary — while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an under - voice , and the declaration with which she began of , “ I am sure I would give up the part to Julia most willingly , but that though I shall probably do it very ill , I feel persuaded _ she _ would do it worse , ” was doubtless receiving all the compliments it called for .

But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two : there was still a great deal to be settled ; and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage , Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates , soon after their being reassembled in the drawing - room , seated themselves in committee at a separate table , with the play open before them , and were just getting deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford , who , late and dark and dirty as it was , could not help coming , and were received with the most grateful joy . “ Well , how do you go on ? ” and “ What have you settled ? ” and “ Oh ! we can do nothing without you , ” followed the first salutations ; and Henry Crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table , while his sister made her way to Lady Bertram , and with pleasant attention was complimenting _ her _ .

Henry Crawford	agent	acted	Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the play as any of them ; Henry Crawford acted well , and it was a pleasure to _ her _ to creep into the theatre , and attend the rehearsal of the first act , in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for Maria . 
Henry Crawford	agent	proposing	She worked very diligently under her aunt ’s directions , but her diligence and her silence concealed a very absent , anxious mind ; and about noon she made her escape with her work to the East room , that she might have no concern in another , and , as she deemed it , most unnecessary rehearsal of the first act , which Henry Crawford was just proposing , desirous at once of having her time to herself , and of avoiding the sight of Mr. Rushworth .

Henry Crawford	agent	ask	Her sensations were indefinable , and so were they a few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford , who had a chair between herself and Tom , ask the latter in an undervoice whether there were any plans for resuming the play after the present happy interruption ( with a courteous glance at Sir Thomas ) , because , in that case , he should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time required by the party : he was going away immediately , being to meet his uncle at Bath without delay ; but if there were any prospect of a renewal of Lovers ’ Vows , he should hold himself positively engaged , he should break through every other claim , he should absolutely condition with his uncle for attending them whenever he might be wanted . 
Henry Crawford	agent	gone	Henry Crawford gone , she could even pity her sister . 
Henry Crawford	agent	leaving	Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four days after Henry Crawford ’s leaving Mansfield , before her feelings were at all tranquillised , before she had given up every hope of him , or absolutely resolved on enduring his rival , her answer might have been different ; but after another three or four days , when there was no return , no letter , no message , no symptom of a softened heart , no hope of advantage from separation , her mind became cool enough to seek all the comfort that pride and self revenge could give .

Henry Crawford	agent	proved	He proved , however , to be too late . 
Henry Crawford	agent	hoped	All those fine first feelings , of which he had hoped to be the exciter , were already given . 
Henry Crawford	agent	obtaining	There could be no doubt of his obtaining leave of absence immediately , for he was still only a midshipman ; and as his parents , from living on the spot , must already have seen him , and be seeing him perhaps daily , his direct holidays might with justice be instantly given to the sister , who had been his best correspondent through a period of seven years , and the uncle who had done most for his support and advancement ; and accordingly the reply to her reply , fixing a very early day for his arrival , came as soon as possible ; and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny had been in the agitation of her first dinner - visit , when she found herself in an agitation of a higher nature , watching in the hall , in the lobby , on the stairs , for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her a brother . It came happily while she was thus waiting ; and there being neither ceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment of meeting , she was with him as he entered the house , and the first minutes of exquisite feeling had no interruption and no witnesses , unless the servants chiefly intent upon opening the proper doors could be called such . 
Henry Crawford	agent	honoured	He honoured the warm - hearted , blunt fondness of the young sailor , which led him to say , with his hands stretched towards Fanny ’s head , “ Do you know , I begin to like that queer fashion already , though when I first heard of such things being done in England , I could not believe it ; and when Mrs. Brown , and the other women at the Commissioner ’s at Gibraltar , appeared in the same trim , I thought they were mad ; but Fanny can reconcile me to anything ” ; and saw , with lively admiration , the glow of Fanny ’s cheek , the brightness of her eye ,

Henry Crawford	agent	foreseen	She interested him more than he had foreseen . 
Henry Crawford	agent	listened	His recitals were amusing in themselves to Sir Thomas , but the chief object in seeking them was to understand the reciter , to know the young man by his histories ; and he listened to his clear , simple , spirited details with full satisfaction , seeing in them the proof of good principles , professional knowledge , energy , courage , and cheerfulness , everything that could deserve or promise well . 
Henry Crawford	agent	longed	He longed to have been at sea , and seen and done and suffered as much . 
Henry Crawford	agent	felt	His heart was warmed , his fancy fired , and he felt the highest respect for a lad who , before he was twenty , had gone through such bodily hardships and given such proofs of mind . 
Henry Crawford	agent	wished	made his own habits of selfish indulgence appear in shameful contrast ; and he wished he had been a William Price , distinguishing himself and working his way to fortune and consequence with so much self - respect and happy ardour , instead of what he was ! The wish was rather eager than lasting . 
Henry Crawford	agent	found	He was roused from the reverie of retrospection and regret produced by it , by some inquiry from Edmund as to his plans for the next day ’s hunting ; and he found it was as well to be a man of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command . 
Henry Crawford	agent	wished	In one respect it was better , as it gave him the means of conferring a kindness where he wished to oblige . 
Henry Crawford	agent	mount	Crawford could mount him without the slightest inconvenience to himself , and with only some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas , who knew better than his nephew the value of such a loan , and some alarms to reason away in Fanny . 
Henry Crawford	agent	stepping	Here Fanny interposed , however , with anxious protestations of her own equal ignorance ; she had never played the game nor seen it played in her life ; and Lady Bertram felt a moment ’s indecision again ; but upon everybody ’s assuring her that nothing could be so easy , that it was the easiest game on the cards , and Henry Crawford ’s stepping forward with a most earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss Price , and teach them both , it was so settled ; and Sir Thomas , Mrs. Norris , and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime intellectual state and dignity , the remaining six , under Miss Crawford ’s direction , were arranged round the other .

Henry Crawford	agent	learned	My dearest Henry , the advantage to you of getting away from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his , before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions , or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life ! 
Henry Crawford	agent	marrying	_ You _ are not sensible of the gain , for your regard for him has blinded you ; but , in my estimation , your marrying early may be the saving of you . 
Henry Crawford	agent	grow	To have seen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed , look or gesture , would have broken my heart . ” “ Well , well , we do not think quite alike here . 
Henry Crawford	agent	ceased	but I know you : I know that a wife you _ loved _ would be the happiest of women , and that even when you ceased to love , she would yet find in you the liberality and good - breeding of a gentleman . 
Henry Crawford	agent	seen	“ Had you seen her this morning , Mary , ” he continued , “ attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt ’s stupidity , working with her , and for her , her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work , then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman ’s service , and all this with such unpretending gentleness , so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command , her hair arranged as neatly as it always is , and one little curl falling forward as she wrote , which she now and then shook back , and in the midst of all this , still speaking at intervals to _ me _ , or listening , and as if she liked to listen , to what I said .

Henry Crawford	agent	entered	The two ladies were together in the breakfast - room , and , fortunately for him , Lady Bertram was on the very point of quitting it as he entered . 
Henry Crawford	agent	bowed	Henry , overjoyed to have her go , bowed and watched her off , and without losing another moment , turned instantly to Fanny , and , taking out some letters , said , with a most animated look , “ I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone : I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea . Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are , I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring .

Henry Crawford	agent	done	Henry was most happy to make it more intelligible , by beginning at an earlier stage , and explaining very particularly what he had done .

Henry Crawford	agent	done	When she did understand it , however , and found herself expected to believe that she had created sensations which his heart had never known before , and that everything he had done for William was to be placed to the account of his excessive and unequalled attachment to her , she was exceedingly distressed , and for some moments unable to speak . 
Henry Crawford	agent	said	It was so ; he had said it .

Henry Crawford	agent	thinking	But you are _ not _ thinking of me .

Henry Crawford	agent	take	Now , I am well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you .

Henry Crawford	agent	pretended	The usual plea of increasing engagements was made in excuse for not having written to her earlier ; “ And now that I have begun , ” she continued , “ my letter will not be worth your reading , for there will be no little offering of love at the end , no three or four lines _ passionnées _ from the most devoted H. C. in the world , for Henry is in Norfolk ; business called him to Everingham ten days ago , or perhaps he only pretended the call , for the sake of being travelling at 
Henry Crawford	agent	afforded	Henry could not have afforded her such a house . 
Henry Crawford	agent	comes	my dear sweet Fanny , this is a long letter from London : write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry ’s eyes , when he comes back , and send me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for his sake . 
Henry Crawford	agent	had	— “ I have to inform you , my dearest Fanny , that Henry has been down to Portsmouth to see you ; that he had a delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday , and one still more to be dwelt on the next day , on the ramparts ; when the balmy air , the sparkling sea , and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony , and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect . 
Henry Crawford	agent	makes	He makes me write , but I do not know what else is to be communicated , except this said visit to Portsmouth , and these two said walks , and his introduction to your family , especially to a fair sister of yours , a fine girl of fifteen , who was of the party on the ramparts , taking her first lesson , I presume , in love .

Henry Crawford	agent	indulged	Henry Crawford , ruined by early independence and bad domestic example , indulged in the freaks of a cold - blooded vanity a little too long . 
Henry Crawford	agent	found	Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one amiable woman ’s affections , could he have found sufficient exultation in overcoming the reluctance , in working himself into the esteem and tenderness of Fanny Price , there would have been every probability of success and felicity for him . 
Henry Crawford	agent	deserved	Would he have deserved more , there can be no doubt that more would have been obtained , especially when that marriage had taken place , which would have given him the assistance of her conscience in subduing her first inclination , and brought them very often together .

Henry Crawford	agent	saw	He saw Mrs. Rushworth , was received by her with a coldness which ought to have been repulsive , and have established apparent indifference between them for ever ; but he was mortified , he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose smiles had been so wholly at his command : he must exert himself to subdue so proud a display of resentment ; it was anger on Fanny ’s account ; he must get the better of it , and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram again in her treatment of himself .

Henry Crawford	agent	went	All that followed was the result of her imprudence ; and he went off with her at last , because he could not help it , regretting Fanny even at the moment , but regretting her infinitely more when all the bustle of the intrigue was over , and a very few months had taught him , by the force of contrast , to place a yet higher value on the sweetness of her temper , the purity of her mind , and the excellence of her principles .

Henry Crawford	agent	had	In this world the penalty is less equal than could be wished ; but without presuming to look forward to a juster appointment hereafter , we may fairly consider a man of sense , like Henry Crawford , to be providing for himself no small portion of vexation and regret : vexation that must rise sometimes to self - reproach , and regret to wretchedness , in having so requited hospitality , so injured family peace , so forfeited his best , most estimable , and endeared acquaintance , and so lost the woman whom he had rationally as well as passionately loved . 
Henry Crawford	patient	like	the Miss Bertrams were worth pleasing , and were ready to be pleased ; and he began with no object but of making them like him . 
Henry Crawford	patient	order	She has the advantage in every feature , and I prefer her countenance ; but I like Julia best ; Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest , and I have found her the most agreeable , but I shall always like Julia best , because you order me . ” 
Henry Crawford	patient	tell	“ Do not I tell you that I like her best _ at _ _ first _ ? ” 
Henry Crawford	patient	think	and what was _ her _ opinion of the newcomers ? Few young ladies of eighteen could be less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny . In a quiet way , very little attended to , she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss Crawford ’s beauty ; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford very plain , in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the contrary , she never mentioned _ him _ .

Henry Crawford	patient	take	Mr. Crawford , after properly depreciating his own abilities , was quite at his service in any way that could be useful . Mr. Rushworth then began to propose Mr. Crawford ’s doing him the honour of coming over to Sotherton , and taking a bed there ; when Mrs. Norris , as if reading in her two nieces ’ minds their little approbation of a plan which was to take Mr. Crawford away , interposed with an amendment . “ There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford ’s willingness ; but why should not more of us go ? 
Henry Crawford	patient	devoted	Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning ; she would gladly have been there too , might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed , to hear the harp ; neither could she wonder that , when the evening stroll was over , and the two families parted again , he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home , while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park ; but she thought it a very bad exchange ; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and water for her , would rather go without it than not . 
Henry Crawford	patient	disengaged	Mrs. Norris and her nieces were all well pleased with its revival , and an early day was named and agreed to , provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged : the young ladies 
Henry Crawford	patient	find	Comfortable hopes , however , were given that he would find Mr. Crawford at home . 
Henry Crawford	patient	using	“ That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford ’s , ” said Maria ; “ but the truth is , that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow , and does not know how to drive . 
Henry Crawford	patient	asked	Starting , the lady instinctively moved a step or two , but recovering herself in a moment , affected to laugh , and asked him , in a tone not much louder , “ If he would give her away ? 
Henry Crawford	patient	followed	Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth ; and when , after a little time , the others began to form into parties , these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund , Miss Crawford , and Fanny , who seemed as naturally to unite , and who , after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties , left them and walked on . 
Henry Crawford	patient	took	The season and duties which brought Mr. Bertram back to Mansfield took Mr. Crawford into Norfolk . 
Henry Crawford	patient	missed	Maria , with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her , and doomed to the repeated details of his day ’s sport , good or bad , his boast of his dogs , his jealousy of his neighbours , his doubts of their qualifications , and his zeal after poachers , subjects which will not find their way to female feelings without some talent on one side or some attachment on the other , had missed Mr. Crawford grievously ; and Julia , unengaged and unemployed , felt all the right of missing him much more .

Henry Crawford	patient	see	Fanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike ; but since the day at Sotherton , she could never see Mr. Crawford with either sister without observation , and seldom without wonder or censure ; and had her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise of it in every other respect , had she been sure that she was seeing clearly , and judging candidly , she would probably have made some important communications to her usual confidant . 
Henry Crawford	patient	gone	“ I am rather surprised , ” said she , “ that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon , after being here so long before , full seven weeks ; for I had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about , that I thought something would certainly occur , when he was once gone , to take him elsewhere .

Henry Crawford	patient	suspects	believe , suspects him of a preference for Julia ; I have never seen much symptom of it , but I wish it may be so . 
Henry Crawford	patient	found	Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from Maria ; and I am not at all afraid for her , after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong . 
Henry Crawford	patient	like	She did not like him as a man , but she must admit him to be the best actor , and on this point there were not many who differed from her . 
Henry Crawford	patient	admire	For the life and soul of me , I can not admire him ; and , between ourselves , to see such an undersized , little , mean - looking man , set up for a fine actor , 
Henry Crawford	patient	teach	Fanny , in her pity and kindheartedness , was at great pains to teach him how to learn , giving him all the helps and directions in her power , trying to make an artificial memory for him , and learning every word of his part herself , but without his being much the forwarder . Many uncomfortable , anxious , apprehensive feelings she certainly had ; but with all these , and other claims on her time and attention , she was as far from finding herself without employment or utility amongst them , as without a companion in uneasiness ; quite as far from having no demand on her leisure as on her compassion . 
Henry Crawford	patient	declaring	It was of the utmost consequence to her that Crawford should now lose no time in declaring himself , and she was disturbed that even a day should be gone by without seeming to advance that point . 
Henry Crawford	patient	see	She had been expecting to see him the whole morning , and all the evening , too , was still expecting him .

Henry Crawford	patient	mistaken	Well , I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two - and - forty speeches to her ” ; adding , with a momentary seriousness , “ She is too good for him — much too good . ” 
Henry Crawford	patient	catching	Fanny ’s eyes were turned on Crawford for a moment with an expression more than grave — even reproachful ; but on catching his , were instantly withdrawn . 
Henry Crawford	patient	refuse	But , Crawford , though I refuse you as a tenant , come to me as a friend . 
Henry Crawford	patient	speak	You will find the beginning of a note to yourself ; but I can now speak my business , which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle — a chain for William ’s cross . 
Henry Crawford	patient	perceiving	brought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her , and her thoughts were put into another channel by his engaging her almost instantly for the first two dances . 
Henry Crawford	patient	brought	Mr. Crawford was not far off ; Sir Thomas brought him to her , saying something which discovered to Fanny , that _ she _ was to lead the way and open the ball ; an idea that had never occurred to her before . 
Henry Crawford	patient	asked	After a short consideration , Sir Thomas asked Crawford to join the early breakfast party in that house instead of eating alone : he should himself be of it ; and the readiness with which his invitation was accepted convinced him that the suspicions whence , he must confess to himself , this very ball had in great measure sprung , were well founded .

Henry Crawford	patient	esteem	Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her so again : he must have seen how unwelcome it was to her ; and in that case , how gratefully she could esteem him for his friendship to William ! 
Henry Crawford	patient	gone	She would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the great staircase , till she had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford ’s having left the house ; but when convinced of his being gone , she was eager to go down and be with her uncle , and have all the happiness of his joy as well as her own , and all the benefit of his information or his conjectures as to what would now be William ’s destination . 
Henry Crawford	patient	engaged	Thomas was as joyful as she could desire , and very kind and communicative ; and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William as to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her , till she found , towards the close , that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and dine there that very day . 
Henry Crawford	patient	see	This was a most unwelcome hearing , for though he might think nothing of what had passed , it would be quite distressing to her to see him again so soon . 
Henry Crawford	patient	understand	I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his manners ; if he understood me as well , he would , I dare say , behave differently . 
Henry Crawford	patient	forgotten	CHAPTER XXXII Fanny had by no means forgotten Mr. Crawford when she awoke the next morning ; but she remembered the purport of her note , and was not less sanguine as to its effect than she had been the night before . 
Henry Crawford	patient	see	Fanny had hoped , in the course of his yesterday ’s visit , to hear the day named ; but he had only spoken of their journey as what would take place ere long . Having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note would convey , she could not but be astonished to see Mr. Crawford , as she accidentally did , coming up to the house again , and at an hour as early as the day before . His coming might have nothing to do with her , but she must avoid seeing him if possible ; and being then on her way upstairs , she resolved there to remain , during the whole of his visit , unless actually sent for ; and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house , there seemed little danger of her being wanted .

Henry Crawford	patient	told	I told him enough yesterday to convince him ; he spoke to me on this subject yesterday , and I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me , and quite out of my power to return his good opinion . ”

Henry Crawford	patient	told	On the contrary , I told him , I can not recollect my exact words , but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him , that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect , and that I begged him never to talk to me in that manner again .

Henry Crawford	patient	refuse	“ Am I to understand , ” said Sir Thomas , after a few moments ’ silence , “ that you mean to _ refuse _ Mr. Crawford ? ” 
Henry Crawford	patient	Refuse	“ Yes , sir . ” “ Refuse him ? ” “ Yes , sir . ” “ Refuse Mr. Crawford ! 
Henry Crawford	patient	like	“ I — I can not like him , sir , well enough to marry him . ” 
Henry Crawford	patient	marry	“ I — I can not like him , sir , well enough to marry him . ” 
Henry Crawford	patient	liking	“ Yes , ” said Fanny , in a faint voice , and looking down with fresh shame ; and she did feel almost ashamed of herself , after such a picture as her uncle had drawn , for not liking Mr. Crawford . 
Henry Crawford	patient	kept	Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer waiting . 
Henry Crawford	patient	refuse	you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness , you resolve to refuse him at once , without wishing even for a little time to consider of it , a little more time for cool consideration , and for really examining your own inclinations ; and are , in a wild fit of folly , throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life , eligibly , honourably , nobly settled , as will , probably , never occur to you again . Here is a young man of sense , of character , of temper , of manners , and of fortune , exceedingly attached to you , and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way ; and let me tell you , Fanny , that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half Mr. Crawford ’s estate , or a tenth part of his merits . Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him . 
Henry Crawford	patient	kept	Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting too long already . 
Henry Crawford	patient	satisfied	You must give him your own answer : we can not expect him to be satisfied with less ; and you only can explain to him 
Henry Crawford	patient	gone	There was comfort , too , in his words , as well as his manner , for he began with , “ Mr. Crawford is gone : he has just left me . 
Henry Crawford	patient	see	Even to see Mr. Crawford would be less overpowering . 
Henry Crawford	patient	distress	She would not , could not believe , that Mr. Crawford ’s affection for her could distress him long ; his mind was not of that sort . 
Henry Crawford	patient	saved	In London he would soon learn to wonder at his infatuation , and be thankful for the right reason in her which had saved him from its evil consequences . While Fanny ’s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes , her uncle was , soon after tea , called out of the room ; an occurrence too common to strike her , and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared ten minutes afterwards , and advancing decidedly towards herself , said , “ Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you , ma’am , in his own room . ” 
Henry Crawford	patient	disdained	She might have disdained him in all the dignity of angry virtue , in the grounds of Sotherton , or the theatre at Mansfield Park ; but he approached her now with rights that demanded different treatment . 
Henry Crawford	patient	love	So thought Fanny , in good truth and sober sadness , as she sat musing over that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs : wondering at the past and present ; wondering at what was yet to come , and in a nervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of her being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford , and the felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it . 
Henry Crawford	patient	saw	He then saw Mr. Crawford , and received his account . 
Henry Crawford	patient	seen	Accordingly , on this principle , Sir Thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her , with a mild gravity , intended to be overcoming , “ Well , Fanny , I have seen Mr. Crawford again , and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you . 
Henry Crawford	patient	told	told him so , that it never will be in my power — 
Henry Crawford	patient	seeing	I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls , as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred . 
Henry Crawford	patient	see	You will see him with the rest of us , in the same manner , and , as much as you can , dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant . 
Henry Crawford	patient	refusing	His surprise was not so great as his father ’s at her refusing Crawford , because , so far from supposing her to consider him with anything like a preference , he had always believed it to be rather the reverse , and could imagine her to be taken perfectly unprepared , but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more desirable than he did . 
Henry Crawford	patient	ask	Crawford called the next day , and on the score of Edmund ’s return , Sir Thomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner ; it was really a necessary compliment . 
Henry Crawford	patient	assured	And by carefully giving way to the inclination of the leaves , he did find it , or within a page or two , quite near enough to satisfy Lady Bertram , who assured him , as soon as he mentioned the name of Cardinal Wolsey , that he had got the very speech . 
Henry Crawford	patient	seeing	as she had been used to suffer in seeing him on the stage with Miss Bertram . 
Henry Crawford	patient	avoid	Edmund watched the progress of her attention , and was amused and gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework , which at the beginning seemed to occupy her totally : how it fell from her hand while she sat motionless over it , and at last , how the eyes which had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were turned and fixed on Crawford — fixed on him for minutes , fixed on him , in short , till the attraction drew Crawford ’s upon her , and the book was closed , and the charm was broken . 
Henry Crawford	patient	drew	Edmund watched the progress of her attention , and was amused and gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework , which at the beginning seemed to occupy her totally : how it fell from her hand while she sat motionless over it , and at last , how the eyes which had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were turned and fixed on Crawford — fixed on him for minutes , fixed on him , in short , till the attraction drew Crawford ’s upon her , and the book was closed , and the charm was broken . 
Henry Crawford	patient	tell	“ You have a great turn for acting , I am sure , Mr. Crawford , ” said her ladyship soon afterwards ; “ and I will tell you what 
Henry Crawford	patient	settled	I mean when you are settled there . 
Henry Crawford	patient	read	For myself , at least , I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be ” ( here was a glance at Fanny ) ; “ that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read , and longing to have it to read myself . 
Henry Crawford	patient	tell	I fancied you might be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive , and not _ allow _ my thoughts to wander . 
Henry Crawford	patient	tell	Are not you going to tell me so ? ” 
Henry Crawford	patient	repulse	Fanny , meanwhile , vexed with herself for not having been as motionless as she was speechless , and grieved to the heart to see Edmund ’s arrangements , was trying by everything in the power of her modest , gentle nature , to repulse Mr. Crawford , and avoid both his looks and inquiries ; and he , unrepulsable , was persisting in both . 
Henry Crawford	patient	tell	Only tell me if I was . 
Henry Crawford	patient	tell	Only tell me if I was wrong . 
Henry Crawford	patient	astonish	You quite astonish me ; I wonder how you can — ” “ Do I astonish you ? ” said he . 
Henry Crawford	patient	gives	I will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner , all that gives me an interest in what you look and do , and excites my present curiosity . 
Henry Crawford	patient	silence	Crawford , delighted to get her to speak at any rate , was determined to keep it up ; and poor Fanny , who had hoped to silence him by such an extremity of reproof , found herself sadly mistaken , and that it was only a change from one object of curiosity and one set of words to another . 
Henry Crawford	patient	wronged	is not by protestations that I shall endeavour to convince you I am wronged ; it is not by telling you that my affections are steady . 
Henry Crawford	patient	forgive	Nay ” ( seeing her draw back displeased ) , “ forgive me . 
Henry Crawford	patient	obliged	Mr. Crawford was obliged to move . 
Henry Crawford	patient	consider	I dare say that , on a comparison of our opinions , they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be : to the point — I consider Crawford ’s proposals as most advantageous and desirable , if you could return his affection . 
Henry Crawford	patient	return	I dare say that , on a comparison of our opinions , they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be : to the point — I consider Crawford ’s proposals as most advantageous and desirable , if you could return his affection . 
Henry Crawford	patient	refusing	I consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it ; but that , as you can not , you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him . 
Henry Crawford	patient	meet	But , even supposing it is so , allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has , how was I to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own ? 
Henry Crawford	patient	like	I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning ; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me . 
Henry Crawford	patient	rating	I am sure his sisters , rating him as they do , must have thought it so , supposing he had meant nothing . 
Henry Crawford	patient	amused	I could not but see that Mr. Crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing . ” 
Henry Crawford	patient	scolded	I have often scolded him for it , but it is his only fault ; and there is this to be said , that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for . 
Henry Crawford	patient	defend	“ I do not defend him . 
Henry Crawford	patient	leave	I leave him entirely to your mercy , and when he has got you at Everingham , I do not care how much you lecture him . 
Henry Crawford	patient	lecture	I leave him entirely to your mercy , and when he has got you at Everingham , I do not care how much you lecture him . 
Henry Crawford	patient	addicted	But this I will say , that his fault , the liking to make girls a little in love with him , is not half so dangerous to a wife ’s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself , which he has never been addicted to . 
Henry Crawford	patient	attached	And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before ; that he loves you with all his heart , and will love you as nearly for ever as possible . 
Henry Crawford	patient	involved	Everything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William ’s mind , and he was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their higher - toned subjects , all of which ended , if they did not begin , in praise of the Thrush , conjectures how she would be employed , schemes for an action with some superior force , which ( supposing the first lieutenant out of the way , and William was not very merciful to the first lieutenant ) was to give himself the next step as soon as possible , or speculations upon prize - money , which was to be generously distributed at home , with only the reservation of enough to make the little cottage comfortable , in which he and Fanny were to pass all their middle and later life together . Fanny ’s immediate concerns , as far as they involved Mr. Crawford , made 
Henry Crawford	patient	name	Good sense , like hers , will always act when really called upon ; and she found that she had been able to name him to her mother , and recall her remembrance of the name , as that of “ William ’s friend , ” though she could not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable at such a moment . 
Henry Crawford	patient	known	The consciousness of his being known there only as William ’s friend 
Henry Crawford	patient	introduced	Having introduced him , however , and being all reseated , the terrors that occurred of what this visit might lead to were overpowering , and she fancied herself on the point of fainting away . 
Henry Crawford	patient	devoted	While trying to keep herself alive , their visitor , who had at first approached her with as animated a countenance as ever , was wisely and kindly keeping his eyes away , and giving her time to recover , while he devoted himself entirely to her mother , addressing her , and attending to her with the utmost politeness and propriety , at the same time with a degree of friendliness , of interest at least , which was making his manner perfect . Mrs. Price ’s manners were also at their best . 
Henry Crawford	patient	come	She felt that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life ; and was only astonished to find that , so great and so agreeable as he was , he should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to the port - admiral , nor the commissioner , nor yet with the intention of going over to the island , nor of seeing the dockyard . 
Henry Crawford	patient	brought	Nothing of all that she had been used to think of as the proof of importance , or the employment of wealth , had brought him to Portsmouth . 
Henry Crawford	patient	struck	She could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr. Crawford must be struck . 
Henry Crawford	patient	taking	Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his future father - in - law with any idea of taking him for a model in dress ; but ( as Fanny instantly , and to her great relief , discerned ) her father was a very different man , a very different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly respected stranger , from what he was in his own family at home . 
Henry Crawford	patient	take	The conclusion of the two gentlemen ’s civilities was an offer of Mr. Price ’s to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard , which Mr. Crawford , desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such , though he had seen the dockyard again and again , and hoping to be so much the longer with Fanny , was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of , if the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue ; and as it was somehow or other ascertained , or inferred , or at least acted upon , that they were not at all afraid , to the dockyard they were all to go ; and but for Mr. Crawford , Mr. Price would have turned thither directly , without the smallest consideration for his daughters ’ errands in the High Street . 
Henry Crawford	patient	avail	The conclusion of the two gentlemen ’s civilities was an offer of Mr. Price ’s to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard , which Mr. Crawford , desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such , though he had seen the dockyard again and again , and hoping to be so much the longer with Fanny , was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of , if the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue ; and as it was somehow or other ascertained , or inferred , or at least acted upon , that they were not at all afraid , to the dockyard they were all to go ; and but for Mr. Crawford , Mr. Price would have turned thither directly , without the smallest consideration for his daughters ’ errands in the High Street . 
Henry Crawford	patient	content	He must content himself with being only generally agreeable , and letting Susan have her share of entertainment , with the indulgence , now and then , of a look or hint for the better - informed and conscious Fanny . 
Henry Crawford	patient	bias	He had suspected his agent of some underhand dealing ; of meaning to bias him against the deserving ; and he had determined to go himself , and thoroughly investigate the merits of the case . 
Henry Crawford	patient	congratulate	He had gone , had done even more good than he had foreseen , had been useful to more than his first plan had comprehended , and was now able to congratulate himself upon it , and to feel that in performing a duty , he had secured agreeable recollections for his own mind . 
Henry Crawford	patient	introduced	He had introduced himself to some tenants whom he had never seen before ; he had begun making acquaintance with cottages whose very existence , though on his own estate , had been hitherto unknown to him . 
Henry Crawford	patient	encouraged	Fanny was doubly silenced here ; though when the moment was passed , could regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged comprehension of one half of his meaning , and encouraged him to say something more of his sister and Edmund . 
Henry Crawford	patient	come	, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute ’s privacy for telling Fanny that his only business in Portsmouth was to see her ; that he was come down for a couple of days on her account , and hers only , and because he could not endure a longer total separation . She was sorry , really sorry ; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said , she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him ; he was much more gentle , obliging , and attentive to other people ’s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield ; she had never seen him so agreeable — so _ near _ being agreeable ; his behaviour to her father could not offend , and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of Susan . He was decidedly improved .

He was decidedly improved . 
Henry Crawford	patient	thank	Before they parted , she had to thank him for another pleasure , and one of no trivial kind . 
Henry Crawford	patient	asked	Her father asked him to do them the honour of taking his mutton with them , and Fanny had time for only one thrill of horror , before he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement . 
Henry Crawford	patient	brought	_ She _ was nice only from natural delicacy , but _ he _ had been brought up in a school of luxury and epicurism . 
Henry Crawford	patient	convinced	She _ said _ she was very well , and did not like to be supposed otherwise ; but take it all in all , he was convinced that her present residence could not be comfortable , and therefore could not be salutary for her , and he was growing anxious for her being again at Mansfield , where her own happiness , and his in seeing her , must be so much greater . 
Henry Crawford	patient	fetched	It may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months ’ end . ” 
Henry Crawford	patient	starved	After being nursed up at Mansfield , it was too late in the day to be hardened at Portsmouth ; and though Sir Thomas , had he known all , might have thought his niece in the most promising way of being starved , both mind and body , into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford ’s good company and good fortune , he would probably have feared to push his experiment farther , lest she might die under the cure . Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day . 
Henry Crawford	patient	seeing	Though tolerably secure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again , she could not help being low . 
Henry Crawford	patient	seeing	Not considering in how different a circle she had been just seeing him , nor how much might be owing to contrast , she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and regardful of others than formerly . 
Henry Crawford	patient	expressed	So anxious for her health and comfort , so very feeling as he now expressed himself , and really seemed , might not it be fairly supposed that he would not much longer persevere in a suit so distressing to her ? 
Henry Crawford	patient	saw	The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser ’s party . 
Henry Crawford	patient	knows	He thoroughly knows his own mind , and acts up to his resolutions : an inestimable quality . 
Henry Crawford	patient	see	I could not see him and my eldest sister in the same room without recollecting what you once told me , and I acknowledge that they did not meet as friends . 
Henry Crawford	patient	convince	As to Mr. Crawford , she hoped it might give him a knowledge of his own disposition , convince him that he was not capable of being steadily attached to any one woman in the world , and shame him from persisting any longer in addressing herself . 
Henry Crawford	patient	shame	As to Mr. Crawford , she hoped it might give him a knowledge of his own disposition , convince him that he was not capable of being steadily attached to any one woman in the world , and shame him from persisting any longer in addressing herself . 
Henry Crawford	patient	accepted	Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not have happened . 
Henry Crawford	patient	leave	She was not to be prevailed on to leave Mr. Crawford . 
Henry Crawford	patient	accommodate	To anything like a permanence of abode , or limitation of society , Henry Crawford had , unluckily , a great dislike : he could not accommodate his sister in an article of such importance ; but he escorted her , with the utmost kindness , into Northamptonshire , and as readily engaged to fetch her away again , at half an hour ’s notice , whenever she were weary of the place . 
Henry Crawford	patient	settle	I should dearly love to settle you both in this country ; and therefore , Henry , you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram , a nice , handsome , good - humoured , accomplished girl , who will make you very happy . 
Henry Crawford	patient	persuade	“ My dear sister , ” said Mary , “ if you can persuade him into anything of the sort , it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever , and I shall only regret that you have 
Henry Crawford	patient	persuade	If you can persuade Henry to marry 
Henry Crawford	patient	trick	I have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn ; and the pains which they , their mothers ( very clever women ) , as well as my dear aunt and myself , have taken to reason , coax , or trick him into marrying , is inconceivable ! 
Henry Crawford	patient	avoid	If your Miss Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke , let them avoid Henry . 
Henry Crawford	patient	spoiled	I assure you he is very detestable ; the Admiral ’s lessons have quite spoiled him . ” 
Henry Crawford	patient	loves	Henry , who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be , who loves me , consults me , confides in me , and will talk to me by the hour together , has never yet turned the page in a letter ; and very often it is nothing more than—‘Dear Mary , I am just arrived . 
Henry Crawford	patient	driven	To own the truth , Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose , which he could not get the better of . 
Henry Crawford	patient	satisfy	Whichever Mr. Yates did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him , and a short parley of compliment ensued . 
Henry Crawford	patient	visit	You will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions 
Henry Crawford	patient	visit	; you will not refuse to visit me in prison ? 
Henry Crawford	patient	distrusted	She distrusted him . 
Henry Crawford	patient	seated	, found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company ; and Mr. Rushworth , having only his own part and his own dress in his head , had soon talked away all that could be said of either . But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two : there was still a great deal to be settled ; and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage , Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates , soon after their being reassembled in the drawing - room , seated themselves in committee at a separate table , with the play open before them , and were just getting deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford , who , late and dark and dirty as it was , could not help coming , and were received with the most grateful joy . “ Well , how do you go on ? ” and “ What have you settled ? ” and “ Oh ! we can do nothing without you , ” followed the first salutations ; and Henry Crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table , while his sister made her way to Lady Bertram , and with pleasant attention was complimenting _ her _ . 
Henry Crawford	patient	entreat	as he did assure her , with a most persuasive smile , that neither he nor Julia had ever had a serious thought of each other , she could only renew her former caution as to the elder sister , entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there , and then gladly take her share in anything that brought cheerfulness to the young people in general , and that did so particularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her . “ I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry , ” was her observation to Mary .

Henry Crawford	patient	send	, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . ” “ I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth ’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . ” “ If you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . ” 
Henry Crawford	patient	encouraging	were no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer the anxious inquiry , and , encouraging him by all means to pay his respects to Sir Thomas without delay , sent him after the others with delighted haste . Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates .

Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates . 
Henry Crawford	patient	gone	He was gone — he had touched her hand for the last time , he had made his parting bow , and she might seek directly all that solitude could do for her . Henry Crawford was gone , gone from the house , and within two hours afterwards from the parish ; and so ended all the hopes his selfish vanity had raised in Maria and Julia Bertram . 
Henry Crawford	patient	gone	Julia could rejoice that he was gone . 
Henry Crawford	patient	gained	His presence was beginning to be odious to her ; and if Maria gained him not , she was now cool enough to dispense with any other revenge . 
Henry Crawford	patient	join	Miss Price , will not you join me in encouraging your cousin ? 
Henry Crawford	patient	amuse	, said , with a smile , “ And how do you think I mean to amuse myself , Mary , on the days that I do not hunt ? 
Henry Crawford	patient	grown	I am grown too old to go out more than three times a week ; but I have a plan for the intermediate days , and what do you think it is ? ” “ To walk and ride with me , to be sure . ” “ Not exactly , though I shall be happy to do both , but _ that _ would be exercise only to my body , and I must take care of my mind . 
Henry Crawford	patient	satisfied	“ But I can not be satisfied without Fanny Price , without making a small hole in Fanny Price ’s heart . 
Henry Crawford	patient	believe	She is just what she was in October , believe me . 
Henry Crawford	patient	persuade	Her eyes should be darker , but she has a sweet smile ; but as for this wonderful degree of improvement , I am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress , and your having nobody else to look at ; and therefore , if you do set about a flirtation with her , you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty , or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and 
Henry Crawford	patient	keep	I only want her to look kindly on me , to give me smiles as well as blushes , to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are , and be all animation when I take it and talk to her ; to think as I think , be interested in all my possessions and pleasures , try to keep me longer at Mansfield , and feel when I go away that she shall be never happy again . 
Henry Crawford	patient	dislike	, his continued attentions — continued , but not obtrusive , and adapting themselves more and more to the gentleness and delicacy of her character — obliged her very soon to dislike him less than formerly . 
Henry Crawford	patient	determining	She had a letter from him herself , a few hurried happy lines , written as the ship came up Channel , and sent into Portsmouth with the first boat that left the Antwerp at anchor in Spithead ; and when Crawford walked up with the newspaper in his hand , which he had hoped would bring the first tidings , he found her trembling with joy over this letter , and listening with a glowing , grateful countenance to the kind invitation which her uncle was most collectedly dictating in reply . It was but the day before that Crawford had made himself thoroughly master of the subject , or had in fact become at all aware of her having such a brother , or his being in such a ship , but the interest then excited had been very properly lively , determining him on his return to town to apply for information as to the probable period of the Antwerp ’s return from the Mediterranean , etc . ; and the good luck which attended his early examination of ship news the next morning seemed the reward of his ingenuity in finding out such a method of pleasing her , as well as of his dutiful attention to the Admiral , in having for many years taken in the paper esteemed to have the earliest naval intelligence . 
Henry Crawford	patient	seen	There could be no doubt of his obtaining leave of absence immediately , for he was still only a midshipman ; and as his parents , from living on the spot , must already have seen him , and be seeing him perhaps daily , his direct holidays might with justice be instantly given to the sister , who had been his best correspondent through a period of seven years , and the uncle who had done most for his support and advancement ; and accordingly the reply to her reply , fixing a very early day for his arrival , came as soon as possible ; and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny had been in the agitation of her first dinner - visit , when she found herself in an agitation of a higher nature , watching in the hall , in the lobby , on the stairs , for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her a brother . It came happily while she was thus waiting ; and there being neither ceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment of meeting , she was with him as he entered the house , and the first minutes of exquisite feeling had no interruption and no witnesses , unless the servants chiefly intent upon opening the proper doors could be called such .

Henry Crawford	patient	led	He honoured the warm - hearted , blunt fondness of the young sailor , which led him to say , with his hands stretched towards Fanny ’s head , “ Do you know , I begin to like that queer fashion already , though when I first heard of such things being done in England , I could not believe it ; and when Mrs. Brown , and the other women at the Commissioner ’s at Gibraltar , appeared in the same trim , I thought they were mad ; but Fanny can reconcile me to anything ” ; and saw , with lively admiration , the glow of Fanny ’s cheek , the brightness of her eye ,

Henry Crawford	patient	interested	She interested him more than he had foreseen . 
Henry Crawford	patient	distinguishing	made his own habits of selfish indulgence appear in shameful contrast ; and he wished he had been a William Price , distinguishing himself and working his way to fortune and consequence with so much self - respect and happy ardour , instead of what he was ! The wish was rather eager than lasting . 
Henry Crawford	patient	roused	He was roused from the reverie of retrospection and regret produced by it , by some inquiry from Edmund as to his plans for the next day ’s hunting ; and he found it was as well to be a man of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command . 
Henry Crawford	patient	accommodated	that , in spite of all Dr. Grant ’s very great kindness , it was impossible for him and his horses to be accommodated where they now were without material inconvenience ; but his attachment to that neighbourhood did not depend upon one amusement or one season of the year : he had set his heart upon having a something there that he could come to at any time , a little homestall at his command , where all the holidays of his year might be spent , and he might find himself continuing , improving , and

Henry Crawford	patient	gone	Henry had said he should just go and ask the Bertrams how they did , and be back in ten minutes , but he was gone above an hour ; 
Henry Crawford	patient	met	when his sister , who had been waiting for him to walk with her in the garden , met him at last most impatiently in the sweep , and cried out , “ My dear Henry , where can you have been all this time ? ” he had only to say that he had been sitting with Lady Bertram and Fanny . “ Sitting with them an hour and a half ! ” exclaimed Mary . 
Henry Crawford	patient	obliged	No : you must be aware that I am quite determined to marry Fanny Price . ” The surprise was now complete ; for , in spite of whatever his consciousness might suggest , a suspicion of his having any such views had never entered his sister ’s imagination ; and she looked so truly the astonishment she felt , that he was obliged to repeat what he had said , and more fully and more solemnly . 
Henry Crawford	patient	caught	“ I am fairly caught . 
Henry Crawford	patient	flatter	I have , I flatter myself , made no inconsiderable progress in her affections ; but my own are entirely fixed . 
Henry Crawford	patient	approve	My dearest Henry , this must be my _ first _ feeling ; but my _ second _ , which you shall have as sincerely , is , that I approve your choice from my soul , and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it . 
Henry Crawford	patient	attach	“ The more I think of it , ” she cried , “ the more am I convinced that you are doing quite right ; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you , I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy . 
Henry Crawford	patient	blinded	_ You _ are not sensible of the gain , for your regard for him has blinded you ; but , in my estimation , your marrying early may be the saving of you . 
Henry Crawford	patient	know	but I know you : I know that a wife you _ loved _ would be the happiest of women , and that even when you ceased to love , she would yet find in you the liberality and good - breeding of a gentleman . 
Henry Crawford	patient	beg	I beg your pardon , but I am bewildered . 
Henry Crawford	patient	courted	If you were to see how he is courted , and how I am courted for his sake ! 
Henry Crawford	patient	exerted	“ I know he must have exerted himself very much , for I know the parties he had to move .

Henry Crawford	patient	see	He was evidently oppressed , and Fanny must grieve for him , though hoping she might never see him again till he were the husband of some other woman . 
Henry Crawford	patient	called	The usual plea of increasing engagements was made in excuse for not having written to her earlier ; “ And now that I have begun , ” she continued , “ my letter will not be worth your reading , for there will be no little offering of love at the end , no three or four lines _ passionnées _ from the most devoted H. C. in the world , for Henry is in Norfolk ; business called him to Everingham ten days ago , or perhaps he only pretended the call , for the sake of being travelling at

Henry Crawford	patient	led	Once it had , by an opening undesigned and unmerited , led him into the way of happiness . 
Henry Crawford	patient	working	Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one amiable woman ’s affections , could he have found sufficient exultation in overcoming the reluctance , in working himself into the esteem and tenderness of Fanny Price , there would have been every probability of success and felicity for him . 
Henry Crawford	patient	pressed	But he was pressed to stay for Mrs. Fraser ’s party ; his staying was made of flattering consequence , and he was to meet Mrs. Rushworth there . 
Henry Crawford	patient	exert	He saw Mrs. Rushworth , was received by her with a coldness which ought to have been repulsive , and have established apparent indifference between them for ever ; but he was mortified , he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose smiles had been so wholly at his command : he must exert himself to subdue so proud a display of resentment ; it was anger on Fanny ’s account ; he must get the better of it , and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram again in her treatment of himself . 
Henry Crawford	patient	put	In this spirit he began the attack , and by animated perseverance had soon re - established the sort of familiar intercourse , of gallantry , of flirtation , which bounded his views ; but in triumphing over the discretion which , though beginning in anger , might have saved them both , he had put himself in the power of feelings on her side more strong than he had supposed . 
Henry Crawford	patient	loved	She loved him ; there was no withdrawing attentions avowedly dear to her . 
Henry Crawford	patient	entangled	He was entangled by his own vanity , with as little excuse of love as possible , and without the smallest inconstancy of mind towards her cousin . 
Henry Crawford	patient	taught	All that followed was the result of her imprudence ; and he went off with her at last , because he could not help it , regretting Fanny even at the moment , but regretting her infinitely more when all the bustle of the intrigue was over , and a very few months had taught him , by the force of contrast , to place a yet higher value on the sweetness of her temper , the purity of her mind , and the excellence of her principles . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	had	Lady Bertram , who was a woman of very tranquil feelings , and a temper remarkably easy and indolent , would have contented herself with merely giving up her sister , and thinking no more of the matter ; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity , which could not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to Fanny , to point out the folly of her conduct , and threaten her with all its possible ill consequences .

Their homes were so distant , and the circles in which they moved so distinct , as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each other ’s existence during the eleven following years , or , at least , to make it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have it in her power to tell them , as she now and then did , in an angry voice , that Fanny had got another child .

Mrs. Norris	agent	had	The division of gratifying sensations ought not , in strict justice , to have been equal ; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and consistent patron of the selected child , and Mrs. Norris had not the least intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	knew	As far as walking , talking , and contriving reached , she was thoroughly benevolent , and nobody knew better how to dictate liberality to others ; but her love of money was equal to her love of directing , and she knew quite as well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends .

Mrs. Norris	agent	said	“ Well , Lady Bertram , ” said Mrs. Norris , moving to go , “ I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family : and so , if Sir Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny , you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question ;

Mrs. Norris	agent	speak	Mrs. Norris could not speak with any temper of such grievances , nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly 
Mrs. Norris	agent	believed	; nobody more hated pitiful doings ; the Parsonage , she believed , had never been wanting in comforts of any sort , had never borne a bad character in _ her _ _ time _ , but this was a way of going on that she could not understand . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	thought	_ Her _ store - room , she thought , might have been good enough for Mrs. Grant to go into . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	find	Inquire where she would , she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	discussed	She could not enter into the wrongs of an economist , but she felt all the injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant ’s being so well settled in life without being handsome , and expressed her astonishment on that point almost as often , though not so diffusely , as Mrs. Norris discussed the other . These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event arose of such importance in the family , as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	get	The earliest intelligence of the travellers ’ safe arrival at Antigua , after a favourable voyage , was received ; though not before Mrs. Norris had been indulging in very dreadful fears , and trying to make Edmund participate them whenever she could get him alone ; and as she depended on being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe , she had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others , when Sir Thomas ’s assurances of their both being alive and well made it necessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches for a while .

Mrs. Norris	agent	help	Mrs. Norris could not help thinking that some steady old thing might be found among the numbers belonging to the Park that would do vastly well ; or that one might be borrowed of the steward ; or that perhaps Dr. Grant might now and then lend them the pony he sent to the post . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	consider	She could not but consider it as absolutely unnecessary , and even improper , that Fanny should have a regular lady ’s horse of her own , in the style of her cousins . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	say	was sure Sir Thomas had never intended it : and she must say that , to be making such a purchase in his absence , and adding to the great expenses of his stable , at a time when a large part of his income was unsettled , seemed to her very unjustifiable . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	see	Mrs. Norris could not see it in the same light . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	tolerate	As the horse continued in name , as well as fact , the property of Edmund , Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny ’s use ; and had Lady Bertram ever thought about her own objection again , he might have been excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas ’s return in September , for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad , and without any near prospect of finishing his business .

Mrs. Norris	agent	talking	It was some months before Sir Thomas ’s consent could be received ; but , in the meanwhile , as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasure in the connexion , the intercourse of the two families was carried on without restraint , and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs. Norris ’s talking of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of at present . Edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in the business ; but no representation of his aunt ’s could induce him to find Mr. Rushworth a desirable companion . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	cried	“ Oh , for shame ! ” cried Mrs. Norris .

Mrs. Norris	agent	interposed	Mr. Crawford , after properly depreciating his own abilities , was quite at his service in any way that could be useful . Mr. Rushworth then began to propose Mr. Crawford ’s doing him the honour of coming over to Sotherton , and taking a bed there ; when Mrs. Norris , as if reading in her two nieces ’ minds their little approbation of a plan which was to take Mr. Crawford away , interposed with an amendment . “ There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford ’s willingness ; but why should not more of us go ?

Mrs. Norris	agent	appeared	Fanny was ready and waiting , and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone , and still no horse was announced , no Edmund appeared . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	seemed	Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing - room , fresh with the evening air , glowing and cheerful , the very reverse of what they found in the three ladies sitting there , for Maria would scarcely raise her eyes from her book , and Lady Bertram was half - asleep ; and even Mrs. Norris , discomposed by her niece ’s ill - humour , and having asked one or two questions about the dinner , which were not immediately attended to , seemed almost determined to say no more . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	know	“ No , not that I know of , ” replied Mrs. Norris ; “ she was here a moment ago . ” Her own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room , which was a very long one , told them that she was on the sofa .

Mrs. Norris	agent	think	I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion , but really I can not do everything at once . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	think	And as for Fanny ’s just stepping down to my house for me — it is not much above a quarter of a mile — I can not think I was unreasonable to ask it . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	pace	How often do I pace it three times a day , early and late , ay , and in all weathers too , and say nothing about it ? 
Mrs. Norris	agent	asked	If she had been riding before , I should not have asked it of her . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	thought	But I thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses ; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind ; and though the sun was strong , it was not so very hot .

Mrs. Norris	agent	cried	it was a pity she should not see the place . ” “ You are very kind , you are all kindness , my dear madam , ” cried Mrs. Norris ; “ but as to Fanny , she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	trying	On his return to the breakfast - room , he found Mrs. Norris trying to make up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford ’s being of the party were desirable or not , or whether her brother ’s barouche would not be full without her . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	added	“ And , my dear Edmund , ” added Mrs. Norris , “ taking out _ two _ carriages when _ one _ will do , would be trouble for nothing ; and , between ourselves , coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and Sotherton : he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage , and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas , when he comes home , find all the varnish scratched off . ” 
Mrs. Norris	agent	repeated	“ Fanny ! ” repeated Mrs. Norris ; “ my dear Edmund , there is no idea of her going with us . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	told	I told Mrs. Rushworth so . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	feel	It would be something so very unceremonious , so bordering on disrespect for Mrs. Rushworth , whose own manners were such a pattern of good - breeding and attention , that she really did not feel equal to it . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	had	Mrs. Norris had no affection for Fanny , and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time ; but her opposition to Edmund _ now _ , arose more from partiality for her own scheme , because it _ was _ her own , than from anything else . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	felt	She felt that she had arranged everything extremely well , and that any alteration must be for the worse . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	arranged	She felt that she had arranged everything extremely well , and that any alteration must be for the worse . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	give	When Edmund , therefore , told her in reply , as he did when she would give him the hearing , that she need not distress herself on Mrs. Rushworth ’s account , because he had taken the opportunity , as he walked with her through the hall , of mentioning Miss Price as one who would probably be of the party , and had directly received a very sufficient invitation for his cousin , 
Mrs. Norris	agent	chuse	Mrs. Norris was too much vexed to submit with a very good grace , and would only say , “ Very well , very well , just as you chuse , settle it your own way , I am sure I do not care about it . ”

Mrs. Norris	agent	staying	“ It seems very odd , ” said Maria , “ that you should be staying at home instead of Fanny . ” “ I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you , ” added Julia , hastily leaving the room as she spoke , from a consciousness that she ought to offer to stay at home herself . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	thought	Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangement which restored him to his share of the party ; and Mrs. Norris thought it an excellent plan , and had it at her tongue ’s end , and was on the point of proposing it , when Mrs. Grant spoke . Wednesday was fine , and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived , Mr. Crawford driving his sisters ; and as everybody was ready , there was nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take their places .

Mrs. Norris	agent	beginning	Mrs. Rushworth submitted ; and the question of surveying the grounds , with the who and the how , was likely to be more fully agitated , and Mrs. Norris was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and horses most could be done , when the young people , meeting with an outward door , temptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately to turf and shrubs , and all the sweets of pleasure - grounds , as by one impulse , one wish for air and liberty , all walked out .

Mrs. Norris	agent	cut	An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from Northampton , and been cut out by Mrs. Norris ( with a saving by her good management of full three - quarters of a yard ) , and was actually forming into a curtain by the housemaids , and still the play was wanting ; and as two or three days passed away in this manner , Edmund began almost to hope that none might ever be found . There were , in fact , so many things to be attended to , so many people to be pleased , so many best characters required , and , above all , such a need that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy , that there did seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by youth and zeal could hold out .

Mrs. Norris	agent	see	I had been looking about me in the poultry - yard , and was just coming out , when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants ’ hall - door with two bits of deal board in his hand , bringing them to father , you may be sure ; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father , and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board , for he could not no how do without them .

Mrs. Norris	agent	believe	The boy looked very silly , and turned away without offering a word , for I believe I might speak pretty sharp ; and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while .

Mrs. Norris	agent	hate	I hate such greediness — so good as your father is to the family , employing the man all the year round ! 
Mrs. Norris	agent	related	Mrs. Norris related again her triumph over Dick Jackson , but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked of , for Edmund ’s disapprobation was felt even by his brother , though he would not have owned it . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	completed	Her entreaty had no effect on Tom : he only said again what he had said before ; and it was not merely Tom , for the requisition was now backed by Maria , and Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Yates , with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious , and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny ; and before she could breathe after it , Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you ! 
Mrs. Norris	agent	entreat	Take the part with a good grace , and let us hear no more of the matter , I entreat . ” 
Mrs. Norris	agent	going	“ I am not going to urge her , ” replied Mrs. Norris sharply ; “ but I shall think her a very obstinate , ungrateful girl , if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her — very ungrateful , indeed , considering who and what she is .

Mrs. Norris	agent	having	The East room , as it had been called ever since Maria Bertram was sixteen , was now considered Fanny ’s , almost as decidedly as the white attic : the smallness of the one making the use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams , with every superiority in their own apartments which their own sense of superiority could demand , were entirely approving it ; and Mrs. Norris , having stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny ’s account , was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody else wanted , though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the indulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house .

Mrs. Norris	agent	tell	_ You _ are best off , I can tell you : but if nobody did more than _ you _ , we should not get on very fast . ” Fanny took the work very quietly , without attempting any defence ; but her kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf — “ One can not wonder , sister , that Fanny _ should _ be delighted : it is all new to her , you know ; you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves , and so am I still ; and as soon as I am a little more at leisure , _ I _ mean to look in at their rehearsals too .

Mrs. Norris	agent	interposed	“ You had better stay till the curtain is hung , ” interposed Mrs. Norris ; “ the curtain will be hung in a day or two — there is very little sense in a play without a curtain — and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons . ”

Mrs. Norris	agent	proceeded	She carried this point , and Sir Thomas ’s narrative proceeded . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	say	His immediate communications were exhausted , and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him , now at one , now at another of the beloved circle ; but the pause was not long : in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative , and what were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say , “ How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately , Sir 
Mrs. Norris	agent	talked	Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as nearly being silenced as ever she had been in her life ; for she was ashamed to confess having never seen any of the impropriety which was so glaring to Sir Thomas , and would not have admitted that her influence was insufficient — that she might have talked in vain . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	had	Her only resource was to get out of the subject as fast as possible , and turn the current of Sir Thomas ’s ideas into a happier channel . She had a great deal to insinuate in her own praise as to _ general _ attention to the interest and comfort of his family , much exertion and many sacrifices to glance at in the form of hurried walks and sudden removals from her own fireside , and many excellent hints of distrust and economy to Lady Bertram and Edmund to detail , whereby a most considerable saving had always arisen , and more than one bad servant been detected . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	took	She took to herself all the credit of bringing Mr. Rushworth ’s admiration of Maria to any effect . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	said	“ If I had not been active , ” said she , “ and made a point of being introduced to his mother , and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit , I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come of it ; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement , and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle .

Mrs. Norris	agent	left	But I left no stone unturned . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	persuade	You know the distance to Sotherton ; it was in the middle of winter , and the roads almost impassable , but I did persuade her . ” 
Mrs. Norris	agent	know	“ I know how great , how justly great , your influence is with Lady Bertram and her children , and am the more concerned that it should not have been — ” “ My dear Sir Thomas , if you had seen the state of the roads _ that _ day ! 
Mrs. Norris	agent	thought	I thought we should never have got through them , though we had the four horses of course ; and poor old coachman would attend us , out of his great love and kindness , though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since Michaelmas .

Mrs. Norris	agent	began	Mrs. Norris began to look about her , and wonder that his falling in love with Julia had come to nothing ; and could almost fear that she had been remiss herself in forwarding it ; but with so many to care for , how was it possible for even _ her _ activity to keep pace with her wishes ? 
Mrs. Norris	agent	contrived	Mrs. Norris contrived to remove one article from his sight that might have distressed him . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	presided	The curtain , over which she had presided with such talent and such success , went off with her to her cottage , where she happened to be particularly in want of green baize . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	came	; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to anybody , and Mrs. Norris , when she came on the morrow , in consequence of an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas , was in a very ill humour , and seemed intent only on lessening her niece ’s pleasure , both present and future , as much as possible 
Mrs. Norris	agent	hope	You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking of you , and to your aunt for letting you go , and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary ; for I hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way , or ever dining out at all ; and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	done	Mrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant ’s part of the favour , that Fanny , who found herself expected to speak , could only say that she was very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her , and that she was endeavouring to put her aunt ’s evening work in such a state as to prevent her being missed . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	fetched	Mrs. Norris fetched breath , and went on again . “ The nonsense and folly of people ’s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves , makes me think it right to give _ you _ a hint , Fanny , now that you are going into company without any of us ; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward , and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins — as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia .

Mrs. Norris	agent	continuing	This was exactly what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at , as each proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they both advised Mrs. Norris ’s continuing where she was , instead of rushing out into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them . William and Fanny soon shewed themselves ; and Sir Thomas had the pleasure of receiving , in his protégé , certainly a very different person from the one he had equipped seven years ago , but a young man of an open , pleasant countenance , and frank , unstudied , but feeling and respectful manners , and such as confirmed him his friend .

Mrs. Norris	agent	inclined	Mrs. Norris , being not at all inclined to question its sufficiency , began to take the matter in another point . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	said	“ It is amazing , ” said she , “ how much young people cost their friends , what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world ! 
Mrs. Norris	agent	said	“ Oh ! ” said Mrs. Norris , with a moment ’s check , “ that was very kind of you , Sir Thomas ; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	know	“ Oh ! ” said Mrs. Norris , with a moment ’s check , “ that was very kind of you , Sir Thomas ; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	assure	Fanny would have had quite as good a walk there , I assure you , with the advantage of being of some use , and obliging her aunt : it is all her fault . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	observed	, I have often observed it before — she likes to go her own way to work ; she does not like to be dictated to ; she takes her own independent walk whenever she can ; she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy , and independence , and nonsense , about her , which I would advise her to get the better of . ”

Mrs. Norris	agent	called	Then it occurred to her what might be going on ; a suspicion rushed over her mind which drove the colour from her cheeks ; but instantly rising , she was preparing to obey , when Mrs. Norris called out , “ Stay , stay , Fanny ! 
Mrs. Norris	agent	coming	It is me , Baddeley , you mean ; I am coming this moment . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	relieved	Mrs. Norris , however , relieved him . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	promised	He pressed for the strictest forbearance and silence towards their niece ; she not only promised , but did observe it . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	looked	She only looked her increased ill - will . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	wanted	But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade her that Fanny could be very well spared—_she _ being ready to give up all her own time to her as requested — and , in short , could not really be wanted or missed .

Mrs. Norris	agent	found	By the time Mrs. Price ’s answer arrived , there remained but a very few days more to be spent at Mansfield ; and for part of one of those days the young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of their journey , for when the mode of it came to be talked of , and Mrs. Norris found that all her anxiety to save her brother - in - law ’s money was vain , and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less expensive conveyance of Fanny , they were to travel post ; when she saw Sir Thomas actually give William notes for the purpose , she was struck with the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage , and suddenly seized with a strong inclination to go with them , to go and see her poor dear sister Price .

Mrs. Norris	agent	proclaimed	She proclaimed her thoughts . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	had	She must say that she had more than half a mind to go with the young people ; it would be such an indulgence to her ; she had not seen her poor dear sister Price for more than twenty years ; and it would be a help to the young people in their journey to have her older head to manage for 
Mrs. Norris	agent	seen	She must say that she had more than half a mind to go with the young people ; it would be such an indulgence to her ; she had not seen her poor dear sister Price for more than twenty years ; and it would be a help to the young people in their journey to have her older head to manage for 
Mrs. Norris	agent	help	she could not help thinking her poor dear sister Price would feel it very unkind of her not to come by such an opportunity . William and Fanny were horror - struck at the idea . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	avoid	It had , in fact , occurred to her , that though taken to Portsmouth for nothing , it would be hardly possible for her to avoid paying her own expenses back again . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	missing	So her poor dear sister Price was left to all the disappointment of her missing such an opportunity , and another twenty years ’ absence , perhaps , begun . Edmund ’s plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey , this absence of Fanny ’s . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	gone	Mrs. Norris , however , had gone home and taken down two old prayer - books of her husband with that idea ; but , upon examination , the ardour of generosity went off . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	went	Mrs. Norris , however , had gone home and taken down two old prayer - books of her husband with that idea ; but , upon examination , the ardour of generosity went off . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	introduced	If tenderness could be ever supposed wanting , good sense and good breeding supplied its place ; and as to the little irritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris , they were short , they were trifling , they were as a drop of water to the ocean , compared with the ceaseless tumult of her present abode . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	having	Edmund was almost as welcome to his brother as Fanny to her aunt ; but Mrs. Norris , instead of having comfort from either , was but the more irritated by the sight of the person whom , in the blindness of her anger , she could have charged as the daemon of the piece . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	had	Mrs. Norris , whose attachment seemed to augment with the demerits of her niece , would have had her received at home and countenanced by them all . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	received	Mrs. Norris , whose attachment seemed to augment with the demerits of her niece , would have had her received at home and countenanced by them all . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	persisted	She persisted in placing his scruples to _ her _ account , though Sir Thomas very solemnly assured her that , had there been no young woman in question , had there been no young person of either sex belonging to him , to be endangered by the society or hurt by the character of Mrs. Rushworth , he would never have offered so great an insult to the neighbourhood as to expect it to notice her . 
Mrs. Norris	agent	resolving	It ended in Mrs. Norris ’s resolving to quit Mansfield and devote herself to her unfortunate Maria , and in an establishment being formed for them in another country , remote and private , where , shut up together with little society , on one side no affection , on the other no judgment , it may be reasonably supposed that their tempers became their mutual punishment 
Mrs. Norris	patient	withhold	“ My dear Sir Thomas , I perfectly comprehend you , and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions , which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct ; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one ’s own hands ; and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	hate	Whatever I can do , as you well know , I am always ready enough to do for the good of those I love ; and , though I could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear children , nor consider her , in any respect , so much my own , I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	used	Having married on a narrower income than she had been used to look forward to , she had , from the first , fancied a very strict line of economy necessary ; and what was begun as a matter of prudence , soon grew into a matter of choice , as an object of that needful solicitude which there were no children to supply . Had there been a family to provide for 
Mrs. Norris	patient	know	, Mrs. Norris might never have saved her money ; but having no care of that kind , there was nothing to impede her frugality , or lessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they had never lived up to . Under this infatuating principle , counteracted by no real affection for her sister , it was impossible for her to aim at more than the credit of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity ; though perhaps she might so little know herself as to walk home to the Parsonage , after this conversation , in the happy belief of being the most liberal - minded sister and aunt in the world . When the subject was brought forward again , her views were more fully explained ; and , in reply to Lady Bertram ’s calm inquiry of “ Where shall the child come to first , sister , to you or to us ? ” 
Mrs. Norris	patient	considering	He had been considering her as a particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage , as a desirable companion to an aunt who had no children of her own ; but he found himself wholly mistaken . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	put	I am not one of those that spare their own trouble ; and Nanny shall fetch her , however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	made	His kindness to his little cousin was consistent with his situation and rights : he made her some very pretty presents , and laughed at her . As her appearance and spirits improved , Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan ; and it was pretty soon decided between them that , though far from clever , she showed a tractable disposition , and seemed likely to give them little trouble . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	put	She was a woman who spent her days in sitting , nicely dressed , on a sofa , doing some long piece of needlework , of little use and no beauty , thinking more of her pug than her children , but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put herself to inconvenience , guided in everything important by Sir Thomas , and in smaller concerns by her sister . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	consoled	, removed first to the Park , and afterwards to a small house of Sir Thomas ’s in the village , and consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him ; and for her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy . The living was hereafter for Edmund ; and , had his uncle died a few years sooner , it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	love	She had never received kindness from her aunt Norris , and could not love her . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	removed	I am to leave Mansfield Park , and go to the White House , I suppose , as soon as she is removed there . ” 
Mrs. Norris	patient	wishes	that wishes me well 
Mrs. Norris	patient	wished	He could not say he _ wished _ me to take Fanny . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	support	Here am I , a poor desolate widow , deprived of the best of husbands , my health gone in attending and nursing him , my spirits still worse , all my peace in this world destroyed , with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman , and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed — what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny ?

Mrs. Norris	patient	trouble	“ You are very good , but do not trouble yourself about them . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	concerned	Tom arrived safely , bringing an excellent account of his father ’s health ; but to very little purpose , as far as Mrs. Norris was concerned . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	appeased	Mrs. Norris , who had begun to redden , was appeased ; and , for a little while , other subjects took place of the improvements of Sotherton . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	take	I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche , and Edmund can go on horseback , you know , sister , and Fanny will stay at home with you . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	accuse	I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion , but really I can not do everything at once . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	sparing	I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion , but really I can not do everything at once . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	persuaded	She has not been out on horseback now this long while , and I am persuaded that , when she does not ride , she ought to walk . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	assuring	The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea , assuring her that the barouche would hold four perfectly well , independent of the box , on which _ one _ might go with him . “ But why is it necessary , ” said Edmund , “ that Crawford ’s carriage , or his _ only _ , should be employed ? 
Mrs. Norris	patient	told	When Edmund , therefore , told her in reply , as he did when she would give him the hearing , that she need not distress herself on Mrs. Rushworth ’s account , because he had taken the opportunity , as he walked with her through the hall , of mentioning Miss Price as one who would probably be of the party , and had directly received a very sufficient invitation for his cousin ,

Mrs. Norris	patient	said	“ Well , Fanny , this has been a fine day for you , upon my word , ” said Mrs. Norris , as they drove through the park . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	fancying	as the whole arrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody , and none at all to herself , as she foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry , bustle , and importance , and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself obliged to leave her own house , where she had been living a month at her own cost , and take up her abode in theirs , that every hour might be spent in their service , she was , in fact , exceedingly delighted with the project . CHAPTER XIV Fanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	keep	Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home ; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	thanked	Edmund , between his theatrical and his real part , between Miss Crawford ’s claims and his own conduct , between love and consistency , was equally unobservant ; and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company , superintending their various dresses with economical expedient , for which nobody thanked her , and saving , with delighted integrity , half a crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas , to have leisure for watching the behaviour , or guarding the happiness of his daughters . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	slaving	I have been slaving myself till I can hardly stand , to contrive Mr. Rushworth ’s cloak without sending for any more satin ; and now I think you may give me your help in putting it together . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	incommoded	Not that _ she _ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas ’s disapprobation when the present state of his house should be known , for her judgment had been so blinded that , except by the instinctive caution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth ’s pink satin cloak as her brother - in - law entered , she could hardly be said to shew any sign of alarm ; but she was vexed by the _ manner _ of his return . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	chuse	The two sisters were so kind to her , and so pleasant , that Fanny might have enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way , and could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at the end of the hour , and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant ’s carriage and horses out to take her home , with which she was threatened . As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather might occasion at home , she had nothing to suffer on that score ; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts , she was perfectly aware that none would be felt , and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain , her being in such cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	believe	_ That _ will never do , believe me . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	have	He was a whist player himself , and perhaps might feel that it would not much amuse him to have her for a partner . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	catch	Sotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris , and being just then in the happy leisure which followed securing the odd trick by Sir Thomas ’s capital play and her own against Dr. and Mrs. Grant ’s great hands , she called out , in high good - humour , “ Sotherton ! 
Mrs. Norris	patient	stopped	Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might depend on , when she was stopped by Sir Thomas ’s saying with authority , “ I do not advise your going to Brighton , William , as I trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting ; but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere ; and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	leaving	As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford ’s behaviour ; but when the whist - table broke up at the end of the second rubber , and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their last play , he became a looker - on at the other , he found his niece the object of attentions , or rather of professions , of a somewhat pointed character . Henry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about Thornton Lacey ; and not being able to catch Edmund ’s ear , was detailing it to his fair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	enabled	She should have to do the honours of the evening ; and this reflection quickly restored so much of her good - humour as enabled her to join in with the others , before their happiness and thanks were all expressed . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	obliged	Mrs. Norris was obliged to be satisfied with thinking just the same , and with having been on the point of proposing the 22nd herself , as by far the best day for the purpose . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	knew	Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _ her _ by commendation of Fanny ; to her , it was as the occasion offered—“Ah ! ma’am , how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to - night ! ” and Mrs. Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had time for , amid so much occupation as she found for herself in making up card - tables , giving hints to Sir Thomas , and trying to move all the chaperons to a better part of the room . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	mean	You mean me , Baddeley , I am sure ; Sir Thomas wants me , not Miss Price . ” 
Mrs. Norris	patient	wants	You mean me , Baddeley , I am sure ; Sir Thomas wants me , not Miss Price . ” 
Mrs. Norris	patient	obliged	Mrs. Norris , much discontented , was obliged to compose herself to work again ; and Fanny , walking off in agitating consciousness , found herself , as she anticipated , in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	compose	Mrs. Norris , much discontented , was obliged to compose herself to work again ; and Fanny , walking off in agitating consciousness , found herself , as she anticipated , in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	classing	Sir Thomas , indeed , was , by this time , not very far from classing Mrs. Norris as one of those well - meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable things . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	persuade	But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade her that Fanny could be very well spared—_she _ being ready to give up all her own time to her as requested — and , in short , could not really be wanted or missed . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	struck	By the time Mrs. Price ’s answer arrived , there remained but a very few days more to be spent at Mansfield ; and for part of one of those days the young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of their journey , for when the mode of it came to be talked of , and Mrs. Norris found that all her anxiety to save her brother - in - law ’s money was vain , and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less expensive conveyance of Fanny , they were to travel post ; when she saw Sir Thomas actually give William notes for the purpose , she was struck with the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage , and suddenly seized with a strong inclination to go with them , to go and see her poor dear sister Price . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	left	Mrs. Norris was left to settle the matter by herself ; and it ended , to the infinite joy of her nephew and niece , in the recollection 
Mrs. Norris	patient	spared	that she could not possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present ; that she was a great deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram for her to be able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a week , and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to that of being useful to them . 
Mrs. Norris	patient	assured	She persisted in placing his scruples to _ her _ account , though Sir Thomas very solemnly assured her that , had there been no young woman in question , had there been no young person of either sex belonging to him , to be endangered by the society or hurt by the character of Mrs. Rushworth , he would never have offered so great an insult to the neighbourhood as to expect it to notice her .

Mrs. Norris	patient	influence	She is also very hardy herself , which of course will influence her in her opinion of the wants of others . 
Maria Bertram	agent	beginning	Being now in her twenty - first year , Maria Bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty ; and as a marriage with Mr. Rushworth would give her the enjoyment of a larger income than her father ’s , as well as ensure her the house in town , which was now a prime object , it became , by the same rule of moral obligation , her evident duty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she could .

Maria Bertram	agent	do	I can not do without Fanny . ” 
Maria Bertram	agent	proceeded	Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next , under the conviction that everybody must be wanting to see Sotherton , to include Miss Crawford in the invitation ; and though Mrs. Grant , who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs. Rushworth , on her coming into the neighbourhood , civilly declined it on her own account , she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister ; and Mary , properly pressed and persuaded , was not long in accepting her share of the civility .

Maria Bertram	agent	cried	“ Unpleasant ! ” cried Maria : “ oh dear ! 
Maria Bertram	agent	believe	I believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat . 
Maria Bertram	agent	said	“ It seems very odd , ” said Maria , “ that you should be staying at home instead of Fanny . ” “ I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you , ” added Julia , hastily leaving the room as she spoke , from a consciousness that she ought to offer to stay at home herself .

On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to Miss Crawford and Fanny , but there was no comparison in the willingness of their attention ; for Miss Crawford , who had seen scores of great houses , and cared for none of them , had only the appearance of civilly listening , while Fanny , to whom everything was almost as interesting as it was new , attended with unaffected earnestness to all that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in former times , its rise and grandeur , regal visits and loyal efforts , delighted to connect anything with history already known , or warm her imagination with scenes of the past .

Maria Bertram	agent	submitted	Mrs. Rushworth submitted ; and the question of surveying the grounds , with the who and the how , was likely to be more fully agitated , and Mrs. Norris was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and horses most could be done , when the young people , meeting with an outward door , temptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately to turf and shrubs , and all the sweets of pleasure - grounds , as by one impulse , one wish for air and liberty , all walked out . 
Maria Bertram	agent	said	“ Suppose we turn down here for the present , ” said Mrs. Rushworth , civilly taking the hint and following them .

Maria Bertram	agent	said	“ What else have you been spunging ? ” said Maria , half - pleased that Sotherton should be so complimented . 
Maria Bertram	agent	chosen	Maria was more to be pitied than Julia ; for to her the father brought a husband , and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness would unite her to the lover , on whom she had chosen that happiness should depend . 
Maria Bertram	agent	do	It was a gloomy prospect , and all she could do was to throw a mist over it , and hope when the mist cleared away she should see something else . 
Maria Bertram	agent	given	Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from Maria ; and I am not at all afraid for her , after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong . 
Maria Bertram	agent	has	But dear Maria has such a strict sense of propriety , so much of that true delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays , Mrs. Rushworth — that wish of avoiding particularity ! 
Maria Bertram	agent	believe	“ I believe we must be satisfied with _ less _ , ” said Maria . 
Maria Bertram	agent	said	“ I believe we must be satisfied with _ less _ , ” said Maria . 
Maria Bertram	agent	considered	Julia _ did _ seem inclined to admit that Maria ’s situation might require particular caution and delicacy — but that could not extend to _ her_—she was at liberty ; and Maria evidently considered her engagement as only raising her so much more above restraint , and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult either father or mother . 
Maria Bertram	agent	gave	Maria gave Edmund a glance , which meant , “ What say you now ? 
Maria Bertram	agent	answered	Three of the characters were now cast , besides Mr. Rushworth , who was always answered for by Maria as willing to do anything ; when Julia , meaning , like her sister , to be Agatha , began to be scrupulous on Miss Crawford ’s account . 
Maria Bertram	agent	trying	She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed the injury to herself : it was a scheme , a trick ; she was slighted , Maria was preferred ; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to suppress shewed how well it was understood ; and before Julia could command herself enough to speak , her brother gave his weight against her too , by saying , “ Oh yes ! 
Maria Bertram	agent	looked	She looked suspiciously at her sister ; Maria ’s countenance was to decide it : if she were vexed and alarmed — but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction , and Julia well knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her expense . 
Maria Bertram	agent	conversed	A short silence succeeded her leaving them ; but her brother soon returned to business and Lovers ’ Vows , and was eagerly looking over the play , with Mr. Yates ’s help , to ascertain what scenery would be necessary — while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an under - voice , and the declaration with which she began of , “ I am sure I would give up the part to Julia most willingly , but that though I shall probably do it very ill , I feel persuaded _ she _ would do it worse , ” was doubtless receiving all the compliments it called for . 
Maria Bertram	agent	blushed	Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered , “ I take the part which Lady Ravenshaw was to have done , and ” ( with a bolder eye ) “ Miss Crawford is to be Amelia . ” “ I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up , with _ us _ , ” replied Edmund , turning away to the fire , where sat his mother , aunt , and Fanny , and seating himself with a look of great vexation .

Maria Bertram	agent	give	In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter ; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates , and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth , Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying , “ I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up . 
Maria Bertram	agent	read	I can not but suppose you _ will _ when you have read it carefully over . 
Maria Bertram	agent	cried	“ We see things very differently , ” cried Maria . 
Maria Bertram	agent	assure	“ I am perfectly acquainted with the play , I assure you ; and with a very few omissions , and so forth , which will be made , of course , I can see nothing objectionable in it ; and _ I _ am not the _ only _ young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation . ”

Maria Bertram	agent	answered	In all points of decorum _ your _ conduct must be law to the rest of the party . ” This picture of her consequence had some effect , for no one loved better to lead than Maria ; and with far more good - humour she answered , “ I am much obliged to you , Edmund ; you mean very well , I am sure : but I still think you see things too strongly ; and I really can not undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind .

Maria Bertram	agent	says	I do not know the play ; but , as Maria says , if there is anything a little too warm ( and it is so with most of them ) it can be easily left out . 
Maria Bertram	agent	backed	Her entreaty had no effect on Tom : he only said again what he had said before ; and it was not merely Tom , for the requisition was now backed by Maria , and Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Yates , with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious , and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny ; and before she could breathe after it , Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here is about nothing : I am quite ashamed of you , Fanny , to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort — so kind as they are to you !

Maria Bertram	agent	spoken	Everything was a friend , or bore her thoughts to a friend ; and though there had been sometimes much of suffering to her ; though her motives had often been misunderstood , her feelings disregarded , and her comprehension undervalued ; though she had known the pains of tyranny , of ridicule , and neglect , yet almost every recurrence of either had led to something consolatory : her aunt Bertram had spoken for her , or Miss Lee had been encouraging , or , 
Maria Bertram	agent	cares	But , Mary , do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry . 
Maria Bertram	agent	flirted	I am sure _ Julia _ does not , or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates ; and though he and Maria are very good friends 
Maria Bertram	agent	likes	, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . ” “ I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth ’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . ” “ If you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . ”

Maria Bertram	agent	loved	Sir Thomas soon appeared , and Maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of the man she loved to her father . 
Maria Bertram	agent	wanted	“ Whose stables do you use at Bath ? ” was the next question ; and while this branch of the subject was under discussion , Maria , who wanted neither pride nor resolution , was preparing to encounter her share of it with tolerable calmness . 
Maria Bertram	agent	knew	He was going , and , if not voluntarily going , voluntarily intending to stay away ; for , excepting what might be due to his uncle , his engagements were all self - imposed . He might talk of necessity , but she knew his independence . 
Maria Bertram	agent	had	She had not long to endure what arose from listening to language which his actions contradicted , or to bury the tumult of her feelings under the restraint of society ; for general civilities soon called his notice from her , and the farewell visit , as it then became openly acknowledged , was a very short one . 
Maria Bertram	agent	seek	He was gone — he had touched her hand for the last time , he had made his parting bow , and she might seek directly all that solitude could do for her . Henry Crawford was gone , gone from the house , and within two hours afterwards from the parish ; and so ended all the hopes his selfish vanity had raised in Maria and Julia Bertram . 
Maria Bertram	agent	gained	His presence was beginning to be odious to her ; and if Maria gained him not , she was now cool enough to dispense with any other revenge . 
Maria Bertram	agent	met	I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . ” In this quarter , indeed , disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas . 
Maria Bertram	agent	like	She could not , did not like him . 
Maria Bertram	agent	repenting	Mr. Rushworth had , perhaps , been accepted on too short an acquaintance , and , on knowing him better , she was repenting . 
Maria Bertram	agent	felt	With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her : told her his fears , inquired into her wishes , entreated her to be open and sincere , and assured her that every inconvenience should be braved , and the connexion entirely given up , if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it .

Maria Bertram	agent	done	Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire , and make way for the fortunate young woman whom her dear son had selected ; and very early in November removed herself , her maid , her footman , and her chariot , with true dowager propriety , to Bath , there to parade over the wonders of Sotherton in her evening parties ; enjoying them as thoroughly , perhaps , in the animation of a card - table , as she had ever done on the spot ; and before the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which gave Sotherton another mistress . 
Maria Bertram	agent	think	Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then , but she would not think of asking her to live there ; and I am sure she is better off here ; and besides , I can not do without her .

Maria Bertram	agent	charged	Edmund was almost as welcome to his brother as Fanny to her aunt ; but Mrs. Norris , instead of having comfort from either , was but the more irritated by the sight of the person whom , in the blindness of her anger , she could have charged as the daemon of the piece . 
Maria Bertram	agent	gone	Mrs. Rushworth had gone , for the Easter holidays , to Twickenham , with a family whom she had just grown intimate with : a family of lively , agreeable manners , and probably of morals and discretion to suit , for to _ their _ house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times .

Maria Bertram	agent	occasioned	These were reflections that required some time to soften ; but time will do almost everything ; and though little comfort arose on Mrs. Rushworth ’s side for the misery she had occasioned , comfort was to be found greater than he had supposed in his other children . 
Maria Bertram	agent	hoped	She hoped to marry him , and they continued together till she was obliged to be convinced that such hope was vain , and till the disappointment and wretchedness arising from the conviction rendered her temper so bad , and her feelings for him so like hatred , as to make them for a while each other ’s punishment , and then induce a voluntary separation .

Maria Bertram	agent	seemed	He had felt her as an hourly evil , which was so much the worse , as there seemed no chance of its ceasing but with life ; she seemed a part of himself that must be borne for ever . 
Maria Bertram	agent	left	To be relieved from her , therefore , was so great a felicity that , had she not left bitter remembrances behind her , there might have been danger of his learning almost to approve the evil which produced such a good .

Maria Bertram	agent	submitted	She had submitted the best to the disappointment in Henry Crawford . 
Maria Bertram	agent	had	After the first bitterness of the conviction of being slighted was over , she had been tolerably soon in a fair way of not thinking of him again ; and when the acquaintance was renewed in town , and Mr. Rushworth ’s house became Crawford ’s object , she had had the merit of withdrawing herself from it , and of chusing that time to pay a visit to her other friends , in order to secure herself from being again too much attracted . 
Maria Bertram	agent	resolve	her increased dread of her father and of home , on that event , imagining its certain consequence to herself would be greater severity and restraint , made her hastily resolve on avoiding such immediate horrors at all risks , it is probable that Mr. Yates would never have succeeded .

Maria Bertram	agent	received	He saw Mrs. Rushworth , was received by her with a coldness which ought to have been repulsive , and have established apparent indifference between them for ever ; but he was mortified , he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose smiles had been so wholly at his command : he must exert himself to subdue so proud a display of resentment ; it was anger on Fanny ’s account ; he must get the better of it , and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram again in her treatment of himself .

Maria Bertram	patient	acknowledged	Mrs. Rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that her son should marry , and declared that of all the young ladies she had ever seen , Miss Bertram seemed , by her amiable qualities and accomplishments , the best adapted to make him happy . 
Maria Bertram	patient	attach	Maria was indeed the pride and delight of them all — perfectly faultless — an angel ; and , of course , so surrounded by admirers , must be difficult in her choice : but yet , as far as Mrs. Norris could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance , Mr. Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve and attach her . 
Maria Bertram	patient	convinced	Lady Bertram constantly declined it ; but her placid manner of refusal made Mrs. Rushworth still think she wished to come , till Mrs. Norris ’s more numerous words and louder tone convinced her of the truth . 
Maria Bertram	patient	assure	“ The fatigue would be too much for my sister , a great deal too much , I assure you , my dear Mrs. Rushworth . 
Maria Bertram	patient	obliged	Mrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram ’s staying at home , could only be sorry . 
Maria Bertram	patient	visiting	Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next , under the conviction that everybody must be wanting to see Sotherton , to include Miss Crawford in the invitation ; and though Mrs. Grant , who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs. Rushworth , on her coming into the neighbourhood , civilly declined it on her own account , she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister ; and Mary , properly pressed and persuaded , was not long in accepting her share of the civility . 
Maria Bertram	patient	attend	Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonage successful ; and Edmund made his appearance just in time to learn what had been settled for Wednesday , to attend Mrs. Rushworth to her carriage , and walk half - way down the park with the two other ladies . 
Maria Bertram	patient	told	I told Mrs. Rushworth so . 
Maria Bertram	patient	assured	Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could remain — their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could not go , and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in taking her , which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got over . 
Maria Bertram	patient	addressed	Of pictures there were abundance , and some few good , but the larger part were family portraits , no longer anything to anybody but Mrs. Rushworth , who had been at great pains to learn all that the housekeeper could teach , and was now almost equally well qualified to shew the house . On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to Miss Crawford and Fanny , but there was no comparison in the willingness of their attention ; for Miss Crawford , who had seen scores of great houses , and cared for none of them , had only the appearance of civilly listening , while Fanny , to whom everything was almost as interesting as it was new , attended with unaffected earnestness to all that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in former times , its rise and grandeur , regal visits and loyal efforts , delighted to connect anything with history already known , or warm her imagination with scenes of the past . 
Maria Bertram	patient	attending	The situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect from any of the rooms ; and while Fanny and some of the others were attending Mrs. Rushworth , Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking his head at the windows . 
Maria Bertram	patient	excuse	Having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of any other use than to contribute to the window - tax , and find employment for housemaids , “ Now , ” said Mrs. Rushworth , “ we are coming to the chapel , which properly we ought to enter from above , and look down upon ; but as we are quite among friends , I will take you in this way , if you will excuse me . 
Maria Bertram	patient	gone	Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford ; and Edmund , Fanny , and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together . 
Maria Bertram	patient	knocking	Your lap seems full of good things , and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully . ” 
Maria Bertram	patient	unite	Maria was more to be pitied than Julia ; for to her the father brought a husband , and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness would unite her to the lover , on whom she had chosen that happiness should depend . 
Maria Bertram	patient	raising	Julia _ did _ seem inclined to admit that Maria ’s situation might require particular caution and delicacy — but that could not extend to _ her_—she was at liberty ; and Maria evidently considered her engagement as only raising her so much more above restraint , and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult either father or mother . 
Maria Bertram	patient	preferred	She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed the injury to herself : it was a scheme , a trick ; she was slighted , Maria was preferred ; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to suppress shewed how well it was understood ; and before Julia could command herself enough to speak , her brother gave his weight against her too , by saying , “ Oh yes ! 
Maria Bertram	patient	prepared	Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well , though affecting to despise it ; and was too much engaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others , or draw any of those conclusions , or feel any of that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for . Thus much was settled before Edmund , who had been out all the morning , knew anything of the matter ; but when he entered the drawing - room before dinner , the buzz of discussion was high between Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates ; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him the agreeable news . 
Maria Bertram	patient	tell	In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter ; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates , and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth , Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying , “ I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up . 
Maria Bertram	patient	suppose	I can not but suppose you _ will _ when you have read it carefully over . 
Maria Bertram	patient	send	It will not be necessary to send you to your _ father ’s _ judgment , I am convinced . ” 
Maria Bertram	patient	assure	“ I am perfectly acquainted with the play , I assure you ; and with a very few omissions , and so forth , which will be made , of course , I can see nothing objectionable in it ; and _ I _ am not the _ only _ young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation . ” 
Maria Bertram	patient	supposed	Say that , on examining the part , you feel yourself unequal to it ; that you find it requiring more exertion and confidence than you can be supposed to have . 
Maria Bertram	patient	told	you have never told me . ” 
Maria Bertram	patient	pressed	The hand which had so pressed hers to his heart ! the hand and the heart were alike motionless and passive now ! 
Maria Bertram	patient	supported	Her spirit supported her , but the agony of her mind was severe . 
Maria Bertram	patient	addressed	With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her : told her his fears , inquired into her wishes , entreated her to be open and sincere , and assured her that every inconvenience should be braved , and the connexion entirely given up , if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it . 
Maria Bertram	patient	entreated	With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her : told her his fears , inquired into her wishes , entreated her to be open and sincere , and assured her that every inconvenience should be braved , and the connexion entirely given up , if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it .

Maria Bertram	patient	release	He would act for her and release her . 
Maria Bertram	patient	pledged	She was in a state of mind to be glad that she had secured her fate beyond recall : that she had pledged herself anew to Sotherton ; that she was safe from the possibility of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her actions , and destroying her prospects ; and retired in proud resolve , determined only to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth in future , that her father might not be again suspecting her .

Maria Bertram	patient	removed	Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire , and make way for the fortunate young woman whom her dear son had selected ; and very early in November removed herself , her maid , her footman , and her chariot , with true dowager propriety , to Bath , there to parade over the wonders of Sotherton in her evening parties ; enjoying them as thoroughly , perhaps , in the animation of a card - table , as she had ever done on the spot ; and before the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which gave Sotherton another mistress . 
Maria Bertram	patient	envy	One need not envy the new Mrs. Rushworth with such a home as _ that _ . ” 
Maria Bertram	patient	want	Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _ her _ by commendation of Fanny ; to her , it was as the occasion offered—“Ah ! ma’am , how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to - night ! ” and Mrs. Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had time for , amid so much occupation as she found for herself in making up card - tables , giving hints to Sir Thomas , and trying to move all the chaperons to a better part of the room . 
Maria Bertram	patient	have	It will be a bitter pill to her ; that is , like other bitter pills , it will have two moments ’ ill flavour , and then be swallowed and forgotten ; for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women ’s , though _ I _ was the object of them . 
Maria Bertram	patient	implicated	Maria and Julia , and especially Maria , were so closely implicated in Mr. Crawford ’s misconduct , that she could not give his character , such as she believed it , without betraying them . 
Maria Bertram	patient	gave	Maria is nobly married ; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia ’s hand , I should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria ’s to Mr. Rushworth . ” 
Maria Bertram	patient	got	I was in it two years ago , when it was Lady Lascelle ’s , and prefer it to almost any I know in London , and certainly she will then feel , to use a vulgar phrase , that she has got her pennyworth for her penny . 
Maria Bertram	patient	tease	I hope she will recollect it , and be satisfied , as well as she may , with moving the queen of a palace , though the king may appear best in the background ; and as I have no desire to tease her , I shall never _ force _ your name upon her again . 
Maria Bertram	patient	overpowered	Maria was her first favourite , the dearest of all ; the match had been her own contriving , as she had been wo nt with such pride of heart to feel and say , and this conclusion of it almost overpowered her . She was an altered creature , quieted , stupefied , indifferent to everything that passed . 
Maria Bertram	patient	fancy	; she had been unable to direct or dictate , or even fancy herself useful . 
Maria Bertram	patient	treated	might perhaps arise almost as much from the personal disrespect with which she had herself been treated as from sensibility for her son . 
Maria Bertram	patient	treated	might perhaps arise almost as much from the personal disrespect with which she had herself been treated as from sensibility for her son . 
Maria Bertram	patient	concealed	But had she been less obstinate , or of less weight with her son , who was always guided by the last speaker , by the person who could get hold of and shut him up , the case would still have been hopeless , for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear again , and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealed somewhere with Mr. Crawford , who had quitted his uncle ’s house , as for a journey , on the very day of her absenting herself . 
Maria Bertram	patient	snatching	Sir Thomas , however , remained yet a little longer in town , in the hope of discovering and snatching her from farther vice , though all was lost on the side of character . _ His _ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of . 
Maria Bertram	patient	obliged	She hoped to marry him , and they continued together till she was obliged to be convinced that such hope was vain , and till the disappointment and wretchedness arising from the conviction rendered her temper so bad , and her feelings for him so like hatred , as to make them for a while each other ’s punishment , and then induce a voluntary separation . 
Maria Bertram	patient	placed	Where she could be placed became a subject of most melancholy and momentous consultation . 
Maria Bertram	patient	felt	He had felt her as an hourly evil , which was so much the worse , as there seemed no chance of its ceasing but with life ; she seemed a part of himself that must be borne for ever . 
Maria Bertram	patient	regretted	She was regretted by no one at Mansfield . 
Maria Bertram	patient	withdrawing	After the first bitterness of the conviction of being slighted was over , she had been tolerably soon in a fair way of not thinking of him again ; and when the acquaintance was renewed in town , and Mr. Rushworth ’s house became Crawford ’s object , she had had the merit of withdrawing herself from it , and of chusing that time to pay a visit to her other friends , in order to secure herself from being again too much attracted .

Maria Bertram	patient	meet	But he was pressed to stay for Mrs. Fraser ’s party ; his staying was made of flattering consequence , and he was to meet Mrs. Rushworth there . 
Maria Bertram	patient	saw	He saw Mrs. Rushworth , was received by her with a coldness which ought to have been repulsive , and have established apparent indifference between them for ever ; but he was mortified , he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose smiles had been so wholly at his command : he must exert himself to subdue so proud a display of resentment ; it was anger on Fanny ’s account ; he must get the better of it , and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram again in her treatment of himself . 
Maria Bertram	patient	see	When he returned from Richmond , he would have been glad to see Mrs. Rushworth no more . 
Julia Bertram	agent	leave	“ I hope she will not tease my poor pug , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ I have but just got Julia to leave it alone . ” “ There will be some difficulty in our way , Mrs. Norris , ” observed Sir Thomas , “ as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up : how to preserve in the minds of my _ daughters _ the consciousness of what they are , without making them think too lowly of their cousin ; and how , without depressing her spirits too far , to make her remember that she is not a _ Miss Bertram _ . 
Julia Bertram	agent	seemed	Mrs. Rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that her son should marry , and declared that of all the young ladies she had ever seen , Miss Bertram seemed , by her amiable qualities and accomplishments , the best adapted to make him happy . 
Julia Bertram	agent	has	She has the advantage in every feature , and I prefer her countenance ; but I like Julia best ; Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest , and I have found her the most agreeable , but I shall always like Julia best , because you order me . ”

Julia Bertram	agent	said	“ You are fond of the sort of thing ? ” said Julia . 
Julia Bertram	agent	caught	Mrs. Grant , hearing the latter part of this speech , enforced it warmly , persuaded that no judgment could be equal to her brother ’s ; and as Miss Bertram caught at the idea likewise , and gave it her full support , declaring that , in her opinion , it was infinitely better to consult with friends and disinterested advisers , than immediately to throw the business into the hands of a professional man , Mr. Rushworth was very ready to request the favour of Mr. Crawford ’s assistance ; and

Julia Bertram	agent	walked	Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing - room , fresh with the evening air , glowing and cheerful , the very reverse of what they found in the three ladies sitting there , for Maria would scarcely raise her eyes from her book , and Lady Bertram was half - asleep ; and even Mrs. Norris , discomposed by her niece ’s ill - humour , and having asked one or two questions about the dinner , which were not immediately attended to , seemed almost determined to say no more .

Julia Bertram	agent	say	You should learn to think of other people ; and , take my word for it , it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa . ” Before half this was said , Fanny was returned to her seat at the table , and had taken up her work again ; and Julia , who was in high good - humour , from the pleasures of the day , did her the justice of exclaiming , “ I must say , ma’am , that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house . ” “ Fanny , ” said Edmund , after looking at her attentively , “ I am sure you have the headache . ” She could not deny it , but said it was not very bad . “ I can hardly believe you , ” he replied ; “ I know your looks too well . 
Julia Bertram	agent	cried	“ What ! ” cried Julia : “ go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather , when we may have seats in a barouche ! 
Julia Bertram	agent	added	“ It seems very odd , ” said Maria , “ that you should be staying at home instead of Fanny . ” “ I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you , ” added Julia , hastily leaving the room as she spoke , from a consciousness that she ought to offer to stay at home herself .

Julia Bertram	agent	had	For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort : her prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side by side , full of conversation and merriment ; and to see only his expressive profile as he turned with a smile to Julia , or to catch the laugh of the other , was a perpetual source of irritation , which her own sense of propriety could but just smooth over .

Julia Bertram	agent	speak	Miss Bertram could now speak with decided information of what she had known nothing about when Mr. Rushworth had asked her opinion ; and her spirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish , when they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal entrance . CHAPTER IX Mr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady ; and the whole party were welcomed by him with due attention .

Julia Bertram	agent	called	While this was passing , the rest of the party being scattered about the chapel , Julia called Mr. Crawford ’s attention to her sister , by saying , “ Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria , standing side by side , exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed . Have not they completely the air of it ? ” 
Julia Bertram	agent	carried	Julia , joining them at the moment , carried on the joke . 
Julia Bertram	agent	cried	“ If Edmund were but in orders ! ” cried Julia , and running to where he stood with Miss Crawford and Fanny : “ My dear Edmund , if you were but in orders now , you might perform the ceremony directly .

Julia Bertram	agent	seemed	Miss Bertram , displeased with her sister , led the way , and all seemed to feel that they had been there long enough . 
Julia Bertram	agent	followed	Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth ; and when , after a little time , the others began to form into parties , these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund , Miss Crawford , and Fanny , who seemed as naturally to unite , and who , after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties , left them and walked on . 
Julia Bertram	agent	issued	She listened , and at length she heard ; she heard voices and feet approaching ; but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those she wanted , when Miss Bertram , Mr. Rushworth , and Mr. Crawford issued from the same path which she had trod herself , and were before her . 
Julia Bertram	agent	expressed	After some minutes spent in this way , Miss Bertram , observing the iron gate , expressed a wish of passing through it into the park , that their views and their plans might be more comprehensive .

Julia Bertram	agent	seen	Julia was vexed , and her temper was hasty ; but she felt that it would not last , and therefore , taking no notice , only asked her if she had not seen Mr. Rushworth .

Julia Bertram	agent	leaving	Whatever cross - accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces , she had found a morning of complete enjoyment ; for the housekeeper , after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants , had taken her to the dairy , told her all about their cows , and given her the receipt for a famous cream cheese ; and since Julia ’s leaving them they had been met by the gardener , with whom she had made a most satisfactory acquaintance , for she had set him right as to his grandson ’s illness , convinced him that it was an ague , and promised him a charm for it ; and he , in return , had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants , and actually presented her with a very curious specimen of heath .

Julia Bertram	agent	admit	He went for a fortnight — a fortnight of such dullness to the Miss Bertrams as ought to have put them both on their guard , and made even Julia admit , in her jealousy of her sister , the absolute necessity of distrusting his attentions , and wishing him not to return ; and a fortnight of sufficient leisure , in the intervals of shooting and sleeping , to have convinced the gentleman that he ought to keep longer away , had he been more in the habit of examining his own motives , and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity was tending ; but , thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad example , he would not look beyond the present moment . 
Julia Bertram	agent	felt	Maria , with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her , and doomed to the repeated details of his day ’s sport , good or bad , his boast of his dogs , his jealousy of his neighbours , his doubts of their qualifications , and his zeal after poachers , subjects which will not find their way to female feelings without some talent on one side or some attachment on the other , had missed Mr. Crawford grievously ; and Julia , unengaged and unemployed , felt all the right of missing him much more .

Julia Bertram	agent	took	Miss Bertram , feeling all the interest of an Agatha in the question , took on her to decide it , by observing to Mr. Yates that this was a point in which height and figure ought to be considered , and that _ his _ being the tallest , seemed to fit him peculiarly for the Baron . 
Julia Bertram	agent	began	Three of the characters were now cast , besides Mr. Rushworth , who was always answered for by Maria as willing to do anything ; when Julia , meaning , like her sister , to be Agatha , began to be scrupulous on Miss Crawford ’s account . 
Julia Bertram	agent	said	“ This is not behaving well by the absent , ” said she . 
Julia Bertram	agent	saw	She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed the injury to herself : it was a scheme , a trick ; she was slighted , Maria was preferred ; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to suppress shewed how well it was understood ; and before Julia could command herself enough to speak , her brother gave his weight against her too , by saying , “ Oh yes !

Julia Bertram	agent	distrusted	She distrusted him . 
Julia Bertram	agent	looked	She looked suspiciously at her sister ; Maria ’s countenance was to decide it : if she were vexed and alarmed — but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction , and Julia well knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her expense . 
Julia Bertram	agent	come	With hasty indignation , therefore , and a tremulous voice , she said to him , “ You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when I come in with a basket of provisions — though one might have supposed — but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering ! ” 
Julia Bertram	agent	stopped	She stopped — Henry Crawford looked rather foolish , and as if he did not know what to say .

Julia Bertram	agent	detest	I quite detest her . 
Julia Bertram	agent	protested	I have always protested against comedy , and this is comedy in its worst form . ” 
Julia Bertram	agent	walked	And so saying , she walked hastily out of the room , leaving awkward feelings to more than one , but exciting small compassion in any except Fanny , who had been a quiet auditor of the whole , and who could not think of her as under the agitations of _ jealousy _ without great pity . 
Julia Bertram	agent	leaving	A short silence succeeded her leaving them ; but her brother soon returned to business and Lovers ’ Vows , and was eagerly looking over the play , with Mr. Yates ’s help , to ascertain what scenery would be necessary — while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an under - voice , and the declaration with which she began of , “ I am sure I would give up the part to Julia most willingly , but that though I shall probably do it very ill , I feel persuaded _ she _ would do it worse , ” was doubtless receiving all the compliments it called for .

Julia Bertram	agent	direct	He had the offer of Count Cassel and Anhalt , and at first did not know which to chuse , and wanted Miss Bertram to direct him ; but upon being made to understand the different style of the characters , and which was which , and recollecting that he had once seen the play in London , and had thought Anhalt a very stupid fellow , he soon decided for the Count .

Julia Bertram	agent	opened	Tom repeated his resolution of going to him early on the morrow ; and though Julia , who had scarcely opened her lips before , observed , in a sarcastic manner , and with a glance first at Maria and then at Edmund , that “ the Mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly , ” Edmund still held his peace , and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity .

Julia Bertram	agent	rejoice	Julia could rejoice that he was gone . 
Julia Bertram	agent	want	She did not want exposure to be added to desertion . 
Julia Bertram	agent	pity	Henry Crawford gone , she could even pity her sister . 
Julia Bertram	agent	struggled	Some other companion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first consequence to his lady ; and Julia was quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as Maria , though she might not have struggled through so much to obtain them , and could better bear a subordinate situation . 
Julia Bertram	agent	made	Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing ; for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth ’s wife must be to fill her house , and give the best balls in the country . ” Fanny was silent , and Miss Crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness , till suddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes , she exclaimed , “ Ah ! here he is . ” 
Julia Bertram	agent	say	But what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say ? ” 
Julia Bertram	agent	disliked	It was an injury and affront to Julia , who ought to have been Mr. Crawford ’s choice ; and , independently of that , she disliked Fanny , because she had neglected her ; and she would have grudged such an elevation to one whom she had been always trying to depress .

Julia Bertram	agent	chose	If Mrs. Rushworth could imagine any interfering obligations , Julia was certainly able to quit London whenever she chose . 
Julia Bertram	agent	offered	It appeared from one of her aunt ’s letters that Julia had offered to return if wanted , but this was all . 
Julia Bertram	agent	remain	It was evident that she would rather remain where she was . 
Julia Bertram	agent	left	She left London a few hours before we entered it . 
Julia Bertram	agent	had	She had so much to do , that not even the horrible story of Mrs. Rushworth ( now fixed to the last point of certainty ) , could affect her as it had done before . 
Julia Bertram	agent	had	She had not time to be miserable . 
Julia Bertram	agent	hoping	Within twenty - four hours she was hoping to be gone ; her father and mother must be spoken to , Susan prepared , everything got ready . 
Julia Bertram	agent	imparting	The happiness she was imparting , too , happiness very little alloyed by the black communication which must briefly precede it — the joyful consent of her father and mother to Susan ’s going with her — the general satisfaction with which the going of both seemed regarded , and the ecstasy of Susan herself , was all serving to support her spirits . 
Julia Bertram	agent	removed	Mr. Rushworth had been gone at this time to Bath , to pass a few days with his mother , and bring her back to town , and Maria was with these friends without any restraint , without even Julia ; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Street two or three weeks before , on a visit to some relations of Sir Thomas ; a removal which her father and mother were now disposed to attribute to some view of convenience on Mr. Yates ’s account . Very soon after the Rushworths ’ return to Wimpole Street , Sir Thomas had received a letter from an old and most particular friend in London , who hearing and witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter , wrote to recommend Sir Thomas ’s coming to London himself , and using his influence with his daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already exposing her to unpleasant remarks , and evidently making Mr. Rushworth uneasy . Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter , without communicating its contents to any creature at Mansfield , when it was followed by another , sent express from the same friend , to break to him the almost desperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people . 
Julia Bertram	agent	taken	He called it a bad thing , done in the worst manner , and at the worst time ; and though Julia was yet as more pardonable than Maria as folly than vice , he could not but regard the step she had taken as opening the worst probabilities of a conclusion hereafter like her sister ’s . 
Julia Bertram	agent	thrown	Such was his opinion of the set into which she had thrown herself . 
Julia Bertram	agent	escaped	That Julia escaped better than Maria was owing , in some measure , to a favourable difference of disposition and circumstance , but in a greater to her having been less the darling of that very aunt , less flattered and less spoilt . 
Julia Bertram	patient	marrying	After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls , the young people justified these opinions , and an engagement , with a due reference to the absent Sir Thomas , was entered into , much to the satisfaction of their respective families , and of the general lookers - on of the neighbourhood , who had , for many weeks past , felt the expediency of Mr. Rushworth ’s marrying Miss Bertram . 
Julia Bertram	patient	marry	I should dearly love to settle you both in this country ; and therefore , Henry , you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram , a nice , handsome , good - humoured , accomplished girl , who will make you very happy .

Julia Bertram	patient	said	“ Those who see quickly , will resolve quickly , and act quickly , ” said Julia .

Julia Bertram	patient	give	Starting , the lady instinctively moved a step or two , but recovering herself in a moment , affected to laugh , and asked him , in a tone not much louder , “ If he would give her away ? 
Julia Bertram	patient	Thank	Her cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken , and , smiling with all the good - humour of success , she said , “ Thank you , my dear Fanny , but I and my gown are alive and well , and so good - bye . ” 
Julia Bertram	patient	asked	Julia was vexed , and her temper was hasty ; but she felt that it would not last , and therefore , taking no notice , only asked her if she had not seen Mr. Rushworth .

Julia Bertram	patient	approaching	At the same moment Mr. Crawford , approaching Julia , said , “ I hope I am not to lose my companion , unless she is afraid of the evening air in so exposed a seat . ” The request had not been foreseen , but was very graciously received , and Julia ’s day was likely to end almost as well as it began . 
Julia Bertram	patient	comforted	Miss Bertram had made up her mind to something different , and was a little disappointed ; but her conviction of being really the one preferred comforted her under it , and enabled her to receive Mr.

Julia Bertram	patient	driven	Maria joined them with the same intent , just then the stoutest of the three ; for the very circumstance which had driven Julia away was to her the sweetest support . 
Julia Bertram	patient	want	Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _ her _ by commendation of Fanny ; to her , it was as the occasion offered—“Ah ! ma’am , how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to - night ! ” and Mrs. Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had time for , amid so much occupation as she found for herself in making up card - tables , giving hints to Sir Thomas , and trying to move all the chaperons to a better part of the room .

William Price	agent	knew	He knew her to be clever , to have a quick apprehension as well as good sense , and a fondness for reading , which , properly directed , must be an education in itself .

William Price	agent	entered	There could be no doubt of his obtaining leave of absence immediately , for he was still only a midshipman ; and as his parents , from living on the spot , must already have seen him , and be seeing him perhaps daily , his direct holidays might with justice be instantly given to the sister , who had been his best correspondent through a period of seven years , and the uncle who had done most for his support and advancement ; and accordingly the reply to her reply , fixing a very early day for his arrival , came as soon as possible ; and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny had been in the agitation of her first dinner - visit , when she found herself in an agitation of a higher nature , watching in the hall , in the lobby , on the stairs , for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her a brother . It came happily while she was thus waiting ; and there being neither ceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment of meeting , she was with him as he entered the house , and the first minutes of exquisite feeling had no interruption and no witnesses , unless the servants chiefly intent upon opening the proper doors could be called such .

William and Fanny soon shewed themselves ; and Sir Thomas had the pleasure of receiving , in his protégé , certainly a very different person from the one he had equipped seven years ago , but a young man of an open , pleasant countenance , and frank , unstudied , but feeling and respectful manners , and such as confirmed him his friend .

William Price	agent	had	With such means in his power he had a right to be listened to ; and though Mrs. Norris could fidget about the room , and disturb everybody in quest of two needlefuls of thread or a second - hand shirt button , in the midst of her nephew ’s account of a shipwreck or an engagement , everybody else was attentive ; and even Lady Bertram could not hear of such horrors unmoved , or without sometimes lifting her eyes from her work to say , “ Dear me ! 
William Price	agent	expressed	With spirits , courage , and curiosity up to anything , William expressed an inclination to hunt ; and 
William Price	agent	relate	that he could relate of his own horsemanship in various countries , of the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged , the rough horses and mules he had ridden , or his many narrow escapes from dreadful falls , that he was at all equal to the management of a high - fed hunter in an English fox - chase ; nor till he returned safe and well , without accident or discredit , could she be reconciled to the risk , or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the horse which he had fully intended it should produce .

William Price	agent	avoid	His mind , now disengaged from the cares which had pressed on him at first , was at leisure to find the Grants and their young inmates really worth visiting ; and though infinitely above scheming or contriving for any the most advantageous matrimonial establishment that could be among the apparent possibilities of any one most dear to him , and disdaining even as a littleness the being quick - sighted on such points , he could not avoid perceiving , in a grand and careless way , that Mr. Crawford was somewhat distinguishing his niece — nor perhaps refrain ( though unconsciously ) from giving a more willing assent to invitations on that account . 
William Price	agent	began	proceeded from good - breeding and goodwill alone , and had nothing to do with Mr. Crawford , but as being one in an agreeable group : for it was in the course of that very visit that he first began to think that any one in the habit of such idle observations _ would _ _ have _ _ thought _ that Mr. Crawford was the admirer of Fanny Price . 
William Price	agent	come	William , you are quite out of luck ; but the next time you come , I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at home , and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly 
William Price	agent	know	They are at Brighton now , you know ; in one of the best houses there , as Mr. Rushworth ’s fine fortune gives them a right to be . 
William Price	agent	get	I do not exactly know the distance , but when you get back to Portsmouth , if it is not very far off , you ought to go over and pay your respects to them ; and I could send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your cousins . 
William Price	agent	going	Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might depend on , when she was stopped by Sir Thomas ’s saying with authority , “ I do not advise your going to Brighton , William , as I trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting ; but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere ; and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own .

William Price	agent	find	“ I would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than anything else , ” was William ’s only answer , in an undervoice , not meant to reach far , and the subject dropped .

William Price	agent	dance	“ Are you fond of dancing , Fanny ? ” “ Yes , very ; only I am soon tired . ” “ I should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance . 
William Price	agent	Have	Have you never any balls at Northampton ? 
William Price	agent	dance	I should like to see you dance , and I ’d dance with you if you _ would _ , for nobody would know who I was here , and I should like to be your partner once more . 
William Price	agent	remained	He remained steadily inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling ; to gratify anybody else who might wish to see Fanny dance , and to give pleasure to the young people in general ; and having thought the matter over , and taken his resolution in quiet independence , the result of it appeared the next morning at breakfast , when , after recalling and commending what his nephew had said , he added , “ I do not like , William , that you should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence .

William Price	agent	make	Thursday , predestined to hope and enjoyment , came ; and opened with more kindness to Fanny than such self - willed , unmanageable days often volunteer , for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought from Mr. Crawford to William , stating that as he found himself obliged to go to London on the morrow for a few days , he could not help trying to procure a companion ; and therefore hoped that if William could make up his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been proposed , he would accept a place in his carriage .

William Price	agent	go	The proposal was a very pleasant one to William himself , who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses , and such a good - humoured , agreeable friend ; and , in likening it to going up with despatches , was saying at once everything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination could suggest ; and Fanny , from a different motive , was exceedingly pleased ; for the original plan was that William should go up by the mail from Northampton the following night , which would not have allowed him an hour ’s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach ; and though this offer of Mr. Crawford ’s would rob her of many hours of his company , she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of such a journey , to think of anything else .

William Price	agent	enjoy	To dance without much observation or any extraordinary fatigue , to have strength and partners for about half the evening , to dance a little with Edmund , and not a great deal with Mr. Crawford , to see William enjoy himself , and be able to keep away from her aunt Norris , was the height of her ambition , and seemed to comprehend her greatest possibility of happiness . 
William Price	agent	walked	This was a hard duty , and she was never summoned to it without looking at William , as he walked about at his ease in the background of the scene , and longing to be with him . 
William Price	agent	enjoying	She was happy whenever she looked at William , and saw how perfectly he was enjoying himself , in every five minutes that she could walk about with him and hear his account of his partners ; she was happy in knowing herself admired ; and she was happy in having the two dances with Edmund still to look forward to , during the greatest part of the evening , her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite engagement with _ him _ was in continual perspective . 
William Price	agent	cried	“ Poor Fanny ! ” cried William , coming for a moment to visit her , and working away his partner ’s fan as if for life , “ how soon she is knocked up ! 
William Price	agent	hope	I hope we shall keep it up these two hours .

William Price	agent	found	William ’s promotion , with all its particulars , he was soon master of ; and with such a secret provision of comfort within his own breast to help the joy , he found in it a source of most gratifying sensation and unvarying cheerfulness all dinner - time .

William Price	agent	believed	His surprise was not so great as his father ’s at her refusing Crawford , because , so far from supposing her to consider him with anything like a preference , he had always believed it to be rather the reverse , and could imagine her to be taken perfectly unprepared , but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more desirable than he did . 
William Price	agent	beginning	while honouring her for what she had done under the influence of her present indifference , honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas could quite echo , he was most earnest in hoping , and sanguine in believing , that it would be a match at last , and that , united by mutual affection , it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly fitted to make them blessed in each other , as he was now beginning seriously to consider them .

William Price	agent	inhabited	They passed the drawbridge , and entered the town ; and the light was only beginning to fail as , guided by William ’s powerful voice , they were rattled into a narrow street , leading from the High Street , and drawn up before the door of a small house now inhabited by Mr. Price .

William Price	agent	walked	Farther discussion was prevented by various bustles : first , the driver came to be paid ; then there was a squabble between Sam and Rebecca about the manner of carrying up his sister ’s trunk , which he would manage all his own way ; and lastly , in walked Mr. Price himself , his own loud voice preceding him , as with something of the oath kind he kicked away his son ’s portmanteau and his daughter ’s bandbox in the passage , and called out for a candle ; no candle was brought , however , and he walked into the room .

William Price	agent	come	The Thrush had had her orders , the wind had changed , and he was sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth ; and during those days she had seen him only twice , in a short and hurried way , when he had come ashore on duty . 
William Price	agent	stepped	He stepped back again to the door to say , “ Take care of Fanny , mother . 
William Price	agent	charge	I charge you , take care of Fanny . ” 
William Price	agent	left	William was gone : and the home he had left her in was , Fanny could not conceal it from herself , in almost every respect the very reverse of what she could have wished . 
William Price	agent	turned	The conclusion of the two gentlemen ’s civilities was an offer of Mr. Price ’s to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard , which Mr. Crawford , desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such , though he had seen the dockyard again and again , and hoping to be so much the longer with Fanny , was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of , if the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue ; and as it was somehow or other ascertained , or inferred , or at least acted upon , that they were not at all afraid , to the dockyard they were all to go ; and but for Mr. Crawford , Mr. Price would have turned thither directly , without the smallest consideration for his daughters ’ errands in the High Street . 
William Price	agent	took	He took care , however , that they should be allowed to go to the shops they came out expressly to visit ; and it did not delay them long , for Fanny could so little bear to excite impatience , or be waited for , that before the gentlemen , as they stood at the door , could do more than begin upon the last naval regulations , or settle the number of three - deckers now in commission , their companions were ready to proceed

William Price	agent	found	They were then to set forward for the dockyard at once , and the walk would have been conducted — according to Mr. Crawford ’s opinion — in a singular manner , had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of it , as the two girls , he found , would have been left to follow , and keep up with them or not , as they could , while they walked on together at their own hasty pace . 
William Price	agent	wished	He was able to introduce some improvement occasionally , though by no means to the extent he wished ; he absolutely would not walk away from them ; and at any crossing or any crowd , when Mr. Price was only calling out , “ Come , girls ; come , Fan ; come , Sue , take care of yourselves ; keep a sharp lookout ! ” he would give them his particular attendance .

William Price	agent	began	Once fairly in the dockyard , he began to reckon upon some happy intercourse with Fanny , as they were very soon joined by a brother lounger of Mr. Price ’s , who was come to take his daily survey of how things went on , and who must prove a far more worthy companion than himself ; and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied going about together , and discussing matters of equal and never - failing interest , while the young people sat down upon some timbers in the yard , or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all went to look at . 
William Price	agent	seen	When Mr. Price and his friend had seen all that they wished , or had time for , the others were ready to return ; and in the course of their walk back 
William Price	agent	cared	Mr. Price cared too little about the report to make her much answer . 
William Price	agent	acknowledged	“ It might be all a lie , ” he acknowledged ; “ but so many fine ladies were going to the devil nowadays that way , that there was no answering for anybody . ” 
William Price	agent	going	“ It might be all a lie , ” he acknowledged ; “ but so many fine ladies were going to the devil nowadays that way , that there was no answering for anybody . ” 
William Price	patient	loved	In return for such services she loved him better than anybody in the world except William : her heart was divided between the two . 
William Price	patient	see	He had said to her , moreover , on the very last morning , that he hoped she might see William again in the course of the ensuing winter , and had charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be known to be in England . “ This was so thoughtful and kind ! ” and would he only have smiled upon her , and called her “ my dear Fanny , ” 
William Price	patient	convince	But he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification , by adding , “ If William does come to Mansfield , I hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement ; though , I fear , he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten . ” 
William Price	patient	brought	Upon the whole , it was a comfortable winter to her ; for though it brought no William to England , the never - failing hope of his arrival was worth much . 
William Price	patient	called	William was often called on by his uncle to be the talker . 
William Price	patient	mount	Crawford could mount him without the slightest inconvenience to himself , and with only some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas , who knew better than his nephew the value of such a loan , and some alarms to reason away in Fanny . 
William Price	patient	engaged	that he could relate of his own horsemanship in various countries , of the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged , the rough horses and mules he had ridden , or his many narrow escapes from dreadful falls , that he was at all equal to the management of a high - fed hunter in an English fox - chase ; nor till he returned safe and well , without accident or discredit , could she be reconciled to the risk , or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the horse which he had fully intended it should produce . 
William Price	patient	kindly	William , you are quite out of luck ; but the next time you come , I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at home , and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly 
William Price	patient	wish	“ But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth , William ? ” “ No , Fanny , that I do not . 
William Price	patient	give	It would give me pleasure to see you both dance . 
William Price	patient	required	William was required to be at Portsmouth on the 24th ; the 22nd would therefore be the last day of his visit ; but where the days were so few it would be unwise to fix on any earlier . 
William Price	patient	mortifying	William had wanted to buy her a gold chain too , but the purchase had been beyond his means , and therefore not to wear the cross might be mortifying him . 
William Price	patient	gone	and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton , and she had reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out , she walked down to the Parsonage without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private discussion ; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important part of it to Fanny , being more than half - ashamed of her own solicitude . She met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage , just setting out to call on her , and as it seemed to her that her friend , though obliged to insist on turning back , was unwilling to lose her walk , she explained her business at once , and observed , that if she would be so kind as to give her opinion , it might be all talked over as well without doors as within . 
William Price	patient	enjoy	To dance without much observation or any extraordinary fatigue , to have strength and partners for about half the evening , to dance a little with Edmund , and not a great deal with Mr. Crawford , to see William enjoy himself , and be able to keep away from her aunt Norris , was the height of her ambition , and seemed to comprehend her greatest possibility of happiness . 
William Price	patient	enjoying	She was happy whenever she looked at William , and saw how perfectly he was enjoying himself , in every five minutes that she could walk about with him and hear his account of his partners ; she was happy in knowing herself admired ; and she was happy in having the two dances with Edmund still to look forward to , during the greatest part of the evening , her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite engagement with _ him _ was in continual perspective . 
William Price	patient	mind	Sleep as long as you can , and never mind me . ” 
William Price	patient	have	She had hoped to have William all to herself the last morning . 
William Price	patient	gone	The ball was over , and the breakfast was soon over too ; the last kiss was given , and William was gone . 
William Price	patient	seeing	After seeing William to the last moment , Fanny walked back to the breakfast - room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy change ; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace , conceiving , perhaps , that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her tender enthusiasm , and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in William ’s plate might but divide 
William Price	patient	gone	She could think of William the next day more cheerfully ; and as the morning afforded her an opportunity of talking over Thursday night with Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford , in a very handsome style , with all the heightenings of imagination , and all the laughs of playfulness which are so essential to the shade of a departed ball , she could afterwards bring her mind without much effort into its everyday state , and easily conform to the tranquillity of the present quiet week . They were indeed a smaller party than she had ever known there for a whole day together , and _ he _ was gone on whom the comfort and cheerfulness of every family meeting and every meal chiefly depended . 
William Price	patient	gone	He would soon be always gone ; and 
William Price	patient	commended	William was kindly commended and his promotion hoped for . 
William Price	patient	require	I may say that even I could not require William Price to excite a greater interest , or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation , than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together . 
William Price	patient	keep	“ _ Now _ William would be able to keep himself , which would make a vast difference to his uncle , for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle ; and , indeed , it would make some difference in _ her _ presents too . 
William Price	patient	given	She was very glad that she had given William what she did at parting , very glad , indeed , that it had been in her power , without material inconvenience , just at that time to give him something rather considerable ; that is , for _ her _ , with _ her _ limited means , for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin .

William Price	patient	put	She knew he must be at some expense , that he would have many things to buy , though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap ; but she was very glad she had contributed her mite towards it . 
William Price	patient	restore	The note was held out , and must be taken ; and as she instantly and with averted eyes walked towards the fireplace , where sat the others , he had nothing to do but to go in good earnest . Fanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation , both of pain and pleasure ; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to die with the day ; for every day would restore the knowledge of William ’s advancement , whereas the pain , she hoped , would return no more . 
William Price	patient	got	It is very uncertain when my interest might have got William on . 
William Price	patient	procured	He was now the Mr. Crawford who was addressing herself with ardent , disinterested love ; whose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and upright , whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of attachment ; who was pouring out his sense of her merits , describing and describing again his affection , proving as far as words could prove it , and in the language , tone , and spirit of a man of talent too , that he sought her for her gentleness and her goodness ; and to complete the whole , he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William ’s promotion ! Here was a change , and here were claims which could not but operate ! 
William Price	patient	consider	His surprise was not so great as his father ’s at her refusing Crawford , because , so far from supposing her to consider him with anything like a preference , he had always believed it to be rather the reverse , and could imagine her to be taken perfectly unprepared , but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more desirable than he did . 
William Price	patient	see	I wish we could see him . 
William Price	patient	see	continuing to see William to the last hour of his remaining on land . Had she ever given way to bursts of delight 
William Price	patient	talked	it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving her the affectionate farewell of a brother . All this passed overnight , for the journey was to begin very early in the morning ; and when the small , diminished party met at breakfast , William and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage . CHAPTER XXXVIII The novelty of travelling , and the happiness of being with William , soon produced their natural effect on Fanny ’s spirits , when Mansfield Park was fairly left behind ; and by the time their first stage was ended , and they were to quit Sir Thomas ’s carriage , she was able to take leave of the old coachman , and send back proper messages , with cheerful looks . Of pleasant talk between the brother and sister there was no end . 
William Price	patient	kissing	And Mr. Campbell was here at four o’clock to ask for you : he has got one of the Thrush ’s boats , and is going off to her at six , and hoped you would be here in time to go with him . ” A stare or two at Fanny , as William helped her out of the carriage , was all the voluntary notice which this brother bestowed ; but he made no objection to her kissing him , though still entirely engaged in detailing farther particulars of the Thrush ’s going out of harbour , in which he had a strong right of interest , being to commence his career of seamanship in her at this very time . Another moment 
William Price	patient	welcome	She was gone again to the street - door , to welcome William . 
William Price	patient	see	my dear William , how glad I am to see you . 
William Price	patient	preceding	Farther discussion was prevented by various bustles : first , the driver came to be paid ; then there was a squabble between Sam and Rebecca about the manner of carrying up his sister ’s trunk , which he would manage all his own way ; and lastly , in walked Mr. Price himself , his own loud voice preceding him , as with something of the oath kind he kicked away his son ’s portmanteau and his daughter ’s bandbox in the passage , and called out for a candle ; no candle was brought , however , and he walked into the room . 
William Price	patient	meet	Fanny with doubting feelings had risen to meet him , but sank down again on finding herself undistinguished in the dusk , and unthought of . 
William Price	patient	have	Fanny shrunk back to her seat , with feelings sadly pained by his language and his smell of spirits ; and he talked on only to his son , and only of the Thrush , though William , warmly interested as he was in that subject , more than once tried to make his father think of Fanny , and her long absence and long journey . After sitting some time longer , a candle was obtained ; but as there was still no appearance of tea , nor , from Betsey ’s reports from the kitchen , much hope of any under a considerable period , William determined to go and change his dress , and make the necessary preparations for his removal on board directly , that he might have his tea in comfort afterwards . 
William Price	patient	promised	and some slight , but essential alteration of his uniform waistcoat , which he had been promised to have done for him , entirely neglected . 
William Price	patient	seeing	CHAPTER XXXIX Could Sir Thomas have seen all his niece ’s feelings , when she wrote her first letter to her aunt , he would not have despaired ; for though a good night ’s rest , a pleasant morning , the hope of soon seeing William again , and the comparatively quiet state of the house , from Tom and Charles being gone to school , Sam on some project of his own , and her father on his usual lounges , enabled her to express herself cheerfully on the subject of home , there were still , to her own perfect consciousness , many drawbacks suppressed . 
William Price	patient	sailed	The Thrush had had her orders , the wind had changed , and he was sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth ; and during those days she had seen him only twice , in a short and hurried way , when he had come ashore on duty .

Lady Bertram	agent	contented	Lady Bertram , who was a woman of very tranquil feelings , and a temper remarkably easy and indolent , would have contented herself with merely giving up her sister , and thinking no more of the matter ; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity , which could not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to Fanny , to point out the folly of her conduct , and threaten her with all its possible ill consequences .

Lady Bertram	agent	received	Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly ; and Sir Thomas , seeing how much she needed encouragement , tried to be all that was conciliating : but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of deportment ; and Lady Bertram , without taking half so much trouble , or speaking one word where he spoke ten , by the mere aid of a good - humoured smile , became immediately the less awful character of the two .

Lady Bertram	agent	brought	Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris — “ I think , sister , we need not keep Miss Lee any longer , when Fanny goes to live with you . ”

Lady Bertram	agent	know	“ Indeed , I do not know .

Lady Bertram	agent	know	Sir Thomas has been writing about it , I know . ” 
Lady Bertram	agent	repeated	Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to convince him how much he had mistaken his sister - in - law ’s views ; and she was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation , or the slightest allusion to it from him . 
Lady Bertram	agent	took	He could not but wonder at her refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt ; but , as she took early care to make him , as well as Lady Bertram , understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family , he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which , at the same time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them , would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself . Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal ; and her spontaneous , untaught felicity on the discovery , conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable to her .

Lady Bertram	agent	riding	The ensuing spring deprived her of her valued friend , the old grey pony ; and for some time she was in danger of feeling the loss in her health as well as in her affections ; for in spite of the acknowledged importance of her riding on horse - back , no measures were taken for mounting her again , “ because , ” as it was observed by her aunts , “ she might ride one of her cousin ’s horses at any time when they did not want them , ” and as the Miss Bertrams regularly wanted their horses every fine day , and had no idea of carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice of any real pleasure , that time , of course , never came .

Lady Bertram	agent	thought	As the horse continued in name , as well as fact , the property of Edmund , Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny ’s use ; and had Lady Bertram ever thought about her own objection again , he might have been excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas ’s return in September , for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad , and without any near prospect of finishing his business . 
Lady Bertram	agent	help	Sir Thomas ’s sending away his son seemed to her so like a parent ’s care , under the influence of a foreboding of evil to himself , that she could not help feeling dreadful presentiments ; and as the long evenings of autumn came on , was so terribly haunted by these ideas , in the sad solitariness of her cottage , as to be obliged to take daily refuge in the dining - room of the Park . 
Lady Bertram	agent	thought	“ If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to return , it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria well married , ” she very often thought ; always when they were in the company of men of fortune , and particularly on the introduction of a young man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and finest places in the country . 
Lady Bertram	agent	said	“ Mr. Rushworth , ” said Lady Bertram , “ if I were you , I would have a very pretty shrubbery . 
Lady Bertram	agent	have	“ Mr. Rushworth , ” said Lady Bertram , “ if I were you , I would have a very pretty shrubbery . 
Lady Bertram	agent	made	Lady Bertram made no objection ; and every one concerned in the going was forward in expressing their ready concurrence , excepting Edmund , who heard it all and said nothing .

Lady Bertram	agent	believed	I could not have believed it ! 
Lady Bertram	agent	think	“ And very ungrateful , I think . ” 
Lady Bertram	agent	said	“ She has got it , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time . ” “ What ! ” cried Edmund ; “ has she been walking as well as cutting roses ; walking across the hot park to your house , and doing it twice , ma’am ? 
Lady Bertram	agent	said	“ I was afraid it would be too much for her , ” said Lady Bertram ; “ but when the roses were gathered , your aunt wished to have them , and then you know they must be taken home

Lady Bertram	agent	said	Between ourselves , Edmund , ” nodding significantly at his mother , “ it was cutting the roses , and dawdling about in the flower - garden , that did the mischief . ” “ I am afraid it was , indeed , ” said the more candid Lady Bertram , 
Lady Bertram	agent	declined	Lady Bertram constantly declined it ; but her placid manner of refusal made Mrs. Rushworth still think she wished to come , till Mrs. Norris ’s more numerous words and louder tone convinced her of the truth .

Lady Bertram	agent	spare	Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her . 
Lady Bertram	agent	falling	Lady Bertram , sunk back in one corner of the sofa , the picture of health , wealth , ease , and tranquillity , was just falling into a gentle doze , while Fanny was getting through the few difficulties of her work for her . 
Lady Bertram	agent	began	Well , Edmund , ” he continued , returning to the former subject , posture , and voice , as soon as Lady Bertram began to nod again , “ but _ this _ I _ will _ maintain , that we shall be doing no harm . ”

Lady Bertram	agent	see	You must see the difference yourself . 
Lady Bertram	agent	do	“ I know my father as well as you do ; and I ’ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him . 
Lady Bertram	agent	have	I have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have ; and as to such alterations as I was suggesting just now , such as moving a bookcase , or unlocking a door , or even as using the billiard - room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it , you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room , and less in the breakfast - room , than we did before he went away , or to my sister ’s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other .

Lady Bertram	agent	answered	She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram , but Edmund said nothing .

Lady Bertram	agent	became	His immediate communications were exhausted , and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him , now at one , now at another of the beloved circle ; but the pause was not long : in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative , and what were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say , “ How do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately , Sir 
Lady Bertram	agent	said	? ” said Lady Bertram . 
Lady Bertram	agent	spare	I can not spare her , and I am sure she does not want to go .

Lady Bertram	agent	do	I will ask Sir Thomas , as soon as he comes in , whether I can do without her . ” 
Lady Bertram	agent	meant	“ As you please , ma’am , on that head ; but I meant my father ’s opinion as to the _ propriety _ of the invitation ’s being accepted or not ; and I think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant , as well as by Fanny , that being the _ first _ invitation it should be accepted . ”

Lady Bertram	agent	know	“ I do not know . 
Lady Bertram	agent	spare	But how can I spare her ? ” 
Lady Bertram	agent	thought	; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to anybody , and Mrs. Norris , when she came on the morrow , in consequence of an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas , was in a very ill humour , and seemed intent only on lessening her niece ’s pleasure , both present and future , as much as possible 
Lady Bertram	agent	hear	You must preach at Mansfield , you know , that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you . 
Lady Bertram	agent	hear	With such means in his power he had a right to be listened to ; and though Mrs. Norris could fidget about the room , and disturb everybody in quest of two needlefuls of thread or a second - hand shirt button , in the midst of her nephew ’s account of a shipwreck or an engagement , everybody else was attentive ; and even Lady Bertram could not hear of such horrors unmoved , or without sometimes lifting her eyes from her work to say , “ Dear me ! 
Lady Bertram	agent	wonder	I wonder anybody can ever go to sea . ” 
Lady Bertram	agent	hesitated	She hesitated . 
Lady Bertram	agent	felt	Here Fanny interposed , however , with anxious protestations of her own equal ignorance ; she had never played the game nor seen it played in her life ; and Lady Bertram felt a moment ’s indecision again ; but upon everybody ’s assuring her that nothing could be so easy , that it was the easiest game on the cards , and Henry Crawford ’s stepping forward with a most earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss Price , and teach them both , it was so settled ; and Sir Thomas , Mrs. Norris , and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime intellectual state and dignity , the remaining six , under Miss Crawford ’s direction , were arranged round the other . 
Lady Bertram	agent	told	“ Bertram , ” said Crawford , some time afterwards , taking the opportunity of a little languor in the game , “ I have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home . ” 
Lady Bertram	agent	talk	You talk of giving it the air of a gentleman ’s residence .

Lady Bertram	agent	have	She will have nothing to say to it . 
Lady Bertram	agent	give	By some such improvements as I have suggested ( I do not really require you to proceed upon my plan , though , by the bye , I doubt anybody ’s striking out a better ) you may give it a higher character . 
Lady Bertram	agent	raise	You may raise it into a _ place _ . 
Lady Bertram	agent	assured	Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very little trouble ; and she assured him “ that she was not at all afraid of the trouble ; indeed , she could not imagine there would be any . ” 
Lady Bertram	agent	imagine	Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very little trouble ; and she assured him “ that she was not at all afraid of the trouble ; indeed , she could not imagine there would be any . ” 
Lady Bertram	agent	listen	Sir Thomas had been amusing himself with shaping a very complete outline of the business ; and as soon as she would listen quietly , could read his list of the families to be invited , from whom he calculated , with all necessary allowance for the shortness of the notice , to collect young people enough to form twelve or fourteen couple : and could detail the considerations which had induced him to 
Lady Bertram	agent	continued	The preparations meanwhile went on , and Lady Bertram continued to sit on her sofa without any inconvenience from them . 
Lady Bertram	agent	had	She had some extra visits from the housekeeper , and her maid was rather hurried in making 
Lady Bertram	agent	said	“ Yes , ” said Lady Bertram , “ she looks very well . 
Lady Bertram	agent	sent	I sent Chapman to her . ” 
Lady Bertram	agent	recollect	“ She could not recollect what it was that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes , or what it was that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny : she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he said he was the finest young man in the room — somebody had whispered something to her

Lady Bertram	agent	forgot	; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be . ” And these were her longest speeches and clearest communications : the rest was only a languid “ Yes , yes ; very well ; did you ? 
Lady Bertram	agent	know	I did not see _ that _ ; I should not know one from the other . ” 
Lady Bertram	agent	think	“ I can not think what is the matter with me , ” said Lady Bertram , when the tea - things were removed .

Lady Bertram	agent	think	They are all going away , I think . 
Lady Bertram	agent	wish	I wish they would stay at home . 
Lady Bertram	agent	prevented	This wish was levelled principally at Julia , who had just applied for permission to go to town with Maria ; and as Sir Thomas thought it best for each daughter that the permission should be granted , Lady Bertram , though in her own good - nature she would not have prevented it , was lamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia ’s return , which would otherwise have taken place about this time . 
Lady Bertram	agent	agreed	Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm “ Yes ” ; and at the end of a quarter of an hour ’s silent consideration spontaneously observed , “ Sir Thomas , I have been thinking — and I am very glad we took Fanny

Lady Bertram	agent	went	She was almost at the door , and not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain , she still went on , after a civil reception , a short sentence about being waited for , and a “ Let Sir Thomas know ” to the servant . 
Lady Bertram	agent	go	Henry , overjoyed to have her go , bowed and watched her off , and without losing another moment , turned instantly to Fanny , and , taking out some letters , said , with a most animated look , “ I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone : I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea . Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are , I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring . 
Lady Bertram	agent	sat	She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever , and began to be in despair of ever getting away ; but at last they were in the drawing - room , and she was able to think as she would , while her aunts finished the subject of William ’s appointment in their own style .

Lady Bertram	agent	make	Everybody at all addicted to letter - writing , without having much to say , which will include a large proportion of the female world at least , must feel with Lady Bertram that she was out of luck in having such a capital piece of Mansfield news as the certainty of the Grants going to Bath , occur at a time when she could make no advantage of it , and will admit that it must have been very mortifying to her to see it fall to the share of her thankless son , and treated as concisely as possible at the end of a long letter , instead of having it to spread over the largest part of a page of her own . 
Lady Bertram	agent	have	Lady Bertram rather shone in the epistolary line , having early in her marriage , from the want of other employment , and the circumstance of Sir Thomas ’s being in Parliament , got into the way of making and keeping correspondents , and formed for herself a very creditable , common - place , amplifying style , so that a very little matter was enough for her : she could not do entirely without any ; she must have something to write about , even to her niece ; and being so soon to lose all the benefit of Dr. Grant ’s gouty symptoms and Mrs. Grant ’s morning calls , it was very hard upon her to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she could put them to .

Lady Bertram	agent	mean	I mean when you are settled there . 
Lady Bertram	agent	do	I do indeed . 
Lady Bertram	agent	think	I think you will fit up a theatre at your house in Norfolk . ” 
Lady Bertram	agent	observed	Instead of being soon well enough to follow his friends , as he had then hoped , his disorder increased considerably , and it was not long before he thought so ill of himself as to be as ready as his physician to have a letter despatched to Mansfield . “ This distressing intelligence , as you may suppose , ” observed her ladyship , after giving the substance of it , “ has agitated us exceedingly , and we can not prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive for the poor invalid , whose state Sir Thomas fears may be very critical ; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother immediately , but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on this distressing occasion , as it would be too trying for me .

Lady Bertram	patient	contented	Lady Bertram , who was a woman of very tranquil feelings , and a temper remarkably easy and indolent , would have contented herself with merely giving up her sister , and thinking no more of the matter ; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity , which could not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to Fanny , to point out the folly of her conduct , and threaten her with all its possible ill consequences .

Lady Bertram	patient	addressed	A large and still increasing family , an husband disabled for active service , but not the less equal to company and good liquor , and a very small income to supply their wants , made her eager to regain the friends she had so carelessly sacrificed ; and she addressed Lady Bertram in a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence , such a superfluity of children , and such a want of almost everything else , as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation . 
Lady Bertram	patient	make	In vain were the well - meant condescensions of Sir Thomas , and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that she would be a good girl ; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug , and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart towards giving her comfort ; she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her , and sleep seeming to be her likeliest friend , she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed 
Lady Bertram	patient	leave	Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her ; but she was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety , or solicitude for his comfort , being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous , or difficult , or fatiguing to anybody but themselves . 
Lady Bertram	patient	astonished	Tom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at home that he could be only nominally missed ; and Lady Bertram was soon astonished to find how very well they did even without his father , how well Edmund could supply his place in carving , talking to the steward , writing to the attorney , settling with the servants , and equally saving her from all possible fatigue or exertion in every particular but that of directing her letters .

Lady Bertram	patient	afforded	She was too indolent even to accept a mother ’s gratification in witnessing their success and enjoyment at the expense of any personal trouble , and the charge was made over to her sister , who desired nothing better than a post of such honourable representation , and very thoroughly relished the means it afforded her of mixing in society without having horses to hire . 
Lady Bertram	patient	admitted	As to her cousins ’ gaieties , she loved to hear an account of them , especially of the balls , and whom Edmund had danced with ; but thought too lowly of her own situation to imagine she should ever be admitted to the same , and listened , therefore , without an idea of any nearer concern in them . 
Lady Bertram	patient	deprived	The ensuing spring deprived her of her valued friend , the old grey pony ; and for some time she was in danger of feeling the loss in her health as well as in her affections ; for in spite of the acknowledged importance of her riding on horse - back , no measures were taken for mounting her again , “ because , ” as it was observed by her aunts , “ she might ride one of her cousin ’s horses at any time when they did not want them , ” and as the Miss Bertrams regularly wanted their horses every fine day , and had no idea of carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice of any real pleasure , that time , of course , never came .

Lady Bertram	patient	forced	Mrs. Norris was most zealous in promoting the match , by every suggestion and contrivance likely to enhance its desirableness to either party ; and , among other means , by seeking an intimacy with the gentleman ’s mother , who at present lived with him , and to whom she even forced Lady Bertram to go through ten miles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit . 
Lady Bertram	patient	entertains	She entertains me ; and she is so extremely pretty , that I have great pleasure in looking at her . 
Lady Bertram	patient	pressing	It was hardly possible , indeed , that anything else should be talked of , for Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it ; and Mrs. Rushworth , a well - meaning , civil , prosing , pompous woman , who thought nothing of consequence , but as it related to her own and her son ’s concerns , had not yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party . 
Lady Bertram	patient	convinced	“ And I am convinced to the contrary . 
Lady Bertram	patient	resolved	“ If you are resolved on acting , ” replied the persevering Edmund , “ I must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way ; and I think a theatre ought not to be attempted . 
Lady Bertram	patient	complimenting	, found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than that of his regret at her secession from their company ; and Mr. Rushworth , having only his own part and his own dress in his head , had soon talked away all that could be said of either . But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two : there was still a great deal to be settled ; and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage , Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates , soon after their being reassembled in the drawing - room , seated themselves in committee at a separate table , with the play open before them , and were just getting deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford , who , late and dark and dirty as it was , could not help coming , and were received with the most grateful joy . “ Well , how do you go on ? ” and “ What have you settled ? ” and “ Oh ! we can do nothing without you , ” followed the first salutations ; and Henry Crawford was soon seated with the other three at the table , while his sister made her way to Lady Bertram , and with pleasant attention was complimenting _ her _ . 
Lady Bertram	patient	answered	She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram , but Edmund said nothing . 
Lady Bertram	patient	found	In the evening it was found , according to the predetermination of Mrs. Grant and her sister , that after making up the whist - table there would remain sufficient for a round game , and everybody being as perfectly complying and without a choice as on such occasions they always are , speculation was decided on almost as soon as whist ; and Lady Bertram soon found herself in the critical situation of being applied to for her own choice between the games , and being required either to draw a card for whist or not . 
Lady Bertram	patient	assuring	Here Fanny interposed , however , with anxious protestations of her own equal ignorance ; she had never played the game nor seen it played in her life ; and Lady Bertram felt a moment ’s indecision again ; but upon everybody ’s assuring her that nothing could be so easy , that it was the easiest game on the cards , and Henry Crawford ’s stepping forward with a most earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss Price , and teach them both , it was so settled ; and Sir Thomas , Mrs. Norris , and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime intellectual state and dignity , the remaining six , under Miss Crawford ’s direction , were arranged round the other . 
Lady Bertram	patient	keep	which , especially in any competition with William , was a work of some difficulty ; and as for Lady Bertram , he must continue in charge of all her fame and fortune through the whole evening ; and if quick enough to keep her from looking at her cards when the deal began , must direct her in whatever was to be done with them to the end of it

Lady Bertram	patient	told	“ Bertram , ” said Crawford , some time afterwards , taking the opportunity of a little languor in the game , “ I have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home . ” 
Lady Bertram	patient	told	“ I told you I lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew - trees , because I can never bear to ask ; but I have not told you that , with my usual luck — for I never do wrong without gaining by it — I found myself in due time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see .

Lady Bertram	patient	require	By some such improvements as I have suggested ( I do not really require you to proceed upon my plan , though , by the bye , I doubt anybody ’s striking out a better ) you may give it a higher character . 
Lady Bertram	patient	spared	_ She _ must be the doer of everything : Lady Bertram would of course be spared all thought and exertion , and it would all fall upon _ her _ . 
Lady Bertram	patient	gone	It was only better than Mrs. Norris ’s sharp answers would have been ; but she being gone home with all the supernumerary jellies to nurse a sick maid , there was peace and good - humour in their little party , though it could not boast much beside . 
Lady Bertram	patient	keep	Fanny , you must do something to keep me awake . 
Lady Bertram	patient	watched	Henry , overjoyed to have her go , bowed and watched her off , and without losing another moment , turned instantly to Fanny , and , taking out some letters , said , with a most animated look , “ I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone : I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea . Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are , I could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring . 
Lady Bertram	patient	told	“ Sir Thomas told me £ 10 would be enough . ” 
Lady Bertram	patient	raised	To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of fortune , raised her , therefore , very much in her opinion .

Lady Bertram	patient	married	By convincing her that Fanny _ was _ very pretty , which she had been doubting about before , and that she would be advantageously married 
Lady Bertram	patient	satisfy	And by carefully giving way to the inclination of the leaves , he did find it , or within a page or two , quite near enough to satisfy Lady Bertram , who assured him , as soon as he mentioned the name of Cardinal Wolsey , that he had got the very speech . 
Lady Bertram	patient	considered	Lady Bertram ’s being just on the other side of the table was a trifle , for she might always be considered as only half - awake , and Edmund ’s advertisements were still of the first utility . 
Lady Bertram	patient	set	And as to the not missing her , which under Mrs. Norris ’s discussion was the point attempted to be proved , she set herself very steadily against admitting any such thing . Sir Thomas had appealed to her reason , conscience , and dignity . 
Lady Bertram	patient	resembled	Of her two sisters , Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram than Mrs. Norris . 
Lady Bertram	patient	pass	Lady Bertram wrote her daily terrors to her niece , who might now be said to live upon letters , and pass all her time between suffering from that of to - day and looking forward to to - morrow ’s . 
Lady Bertram	patient	harassed	They judged it best that Lady Bertram should not be harassed by alarms which , it was to be hoped , would prove unfounded ; but there was no reason why Fanny should not know the truth . 
Lady Bertram	patient	endeavoured	Lady Bertram did not think deeply , but , guided by Sir Thomas , she thought justly on all important points ; and she saw , therefore , in all its enormity , what had happened , and neither endeavoured herself , nor required Fanny to advise her , to think little of guilt and infamy .

Lady Bertram	patient	fixed	After a time , Fanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other subjects , and revive some interest in the usual occupations ; but whenever Lady Bertram _ was _ fixed on the event , she could see it only in one light , as comprehending the loss of a daughter , and a disgrace never to be wiped off . 
Lady Bertram	patient	struck	Tom ’s complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his sister ’s conduct , and his recovery so much thrown back by it , that even Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference , and all her alarms were regularly sent off to her husband ; and Julia ’s elopement , the additional blow which had met him on his arrival in London , though its force had been deadened at the moment , must , she knew , be sorely felt . She saw that it was .

Lady Bertram	patient	flatter	and I flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able to bear the removal without material inconvenience or injury . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	appeared	Maria was indeed the pride and delight of them all — perfectly faultless — an angel ; and , of course , so surrounded by admirers , must be difficult in her choice : but yet , as far as Mrs. Norris could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance , Mr. Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve and attach her . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	marrying	After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls , the young people justified these opinions , and an engagement , with a due reference to the absent Sir Thomas , was entered into , much to the satisfaction of their respective families , and of the general lookers - on of the neighbourhood , who had , for many weeks past , felt the expediency of Mr. Rushworth ’s marrying Miss Bertram . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	taken	“ But I would not have him _ taken _ _ in _ ; I would not have him duped ; I would have it all fair and honourable . ”

Mr. Rushworth	agent	visiting	He had been visiting a friend in the neighbouring county , and that friend having recently had his grounds laid out by an improver , Mr. Rushworth was returned with his head full of the subject , and very eager to be improving his own place in the same way ; and though not saying much to the purpose , could talk of nothing else .

Mr. Rushworth	agent	intended	Mr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his acquiescence , and tried to make out something complimentary ; but , between his submission to _ her _ taste , and his having always intended the same himself , with the superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies in general , and of insinuating that there was one only whom he was anxious to please , he grew puzzled , and Edmund was glad to put an end to his speech by a proposal of wine .

Mr. Rushworth	agent	had	Mr. Rushworth , however , though not usually a great talker , had still more to say on the subject next his heart . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	makes	Miss Crawford listened with submission , and said to herself , “ He is a well - bred man ; he makes the best of it . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	began	Mr. Crawford , after properly depreciating his own abilities , was quite at his service in any way that could be useful . Mr. Rushworth then began to propose Mr. Crawford ’s doing him the honour of coming over to Sotherton , and taking a bed there ; when Mrs. Norris , as if reading in her two nieces ’ minds their little approbation of a plan which was to take Mr. Crawford away , interposed with an amendment . “ There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford ’s willingness ; but why should not more of us go ? 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	come	As Mr. Rushworth did _ not _ come , the injury was increased , and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him ; she could only be sullen to her mother , aunt , and cousin , and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	arrived	CHAPTER VIII Fanny ’s rides recommenced the very next day ; and as it was a pleasant fresh - feeling morning , less hot than the weather had lately been , Edmund trusted that her losses , both of health and pleasure , would be soon made good . While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived , escorting his mother , who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially , in urging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton , which had been started a fortnight before , and which , in consequence of her subsequent absence from home , had since lain dormant . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	discovered	did not forget that stipulation , and though Mrs. Norris would willingly have answered for his being so , they would neither authorise the liberty nor run the risk ; and at last , on a hint from Miss Bertram , Mr. Rushworth discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to walk down to the Parsonage directly , and call on Mr. Crawford , and 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	find	Comfortable hopes , however , were given that he would find Mr. Crawford at home . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	came	Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonage successful ; and Edmund made his appearance just in time to learn what had been settled for Wednesday , to attend Mrs. Rushworth to her carriage , and walk half - way down the park with the two other ladies .

Mr. Rushworth	agent	left	Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain , within the memory of many ; but the late Mr. Rushworth left it off . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	followed	Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth ; and when , after a little time , the others began to form into parties , these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund , Miss Crawford , and Fanny , who seemed as naturally to unite , and who , after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties , left them and walked on . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	issued	She listened , and at length she heard ; she heard voices and feet approaching ; but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those she wanted , when Miss Bertram , Mr. Rushworth , and Mr. Crawford issued from the same path which she had trod herself , and were before her . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	brought	Mr. Rushworth wished he had brought the key ; he had been very near thinking whether he should not bring the key ; he was determined he would never come without the key again ; but still this did not remove the present evil .

Mr. Rushworth	agent	had	“ Miss Bertram thought you would follow her . ” “ I should not have had to follow her if she had staid . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	went	After another pause , he went on—“Pray , Miss Price , are you such a great admirer of this Mr. Crawford as some people are ?

Mr. Rushworth	agent	walked	And letting himself out , he walked off without farther ceremony . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	taking	Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more gay , and she thought that he was taking particular pains , during dinner , to do away any little resentment of the other two , and restore general good - humour . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	looks	after tea , as Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight scene , while the Miss Bertrams , Mr. Rushworth , and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte , she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group , and saying , “ How happy Mr. Rushworth looks ! 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	thinking	He is thinking of November . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	set	Mr. Rushworth has set a good example , and such things are very catching . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	arrived	Miss Crawford accepted the part very readily ; and soon after Miss Bertram ’s return from the Parsonage , Mr. Rushworth arrived , and another character was consequently cast .

Mr. Rushworth	agent	had	He had the offer of Count Cassel and Anhalt , and at first did not know which to chuse , and wanted Miss Bertram to direct him ; but upon being made to understand the different style of the characters , and which was which , and recollecting that he had once seen the play in London , and had thought Anhalt a very stupid fellow , he soon decided for the Count .

Mr. Rushworth	agent	liked	Mr. Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well , though affecting to despise it ; and was too much engaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others , or draw any of those conclusions , or feel any of that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for . Thus much was settled before Edmund , who had been out all the morning , knew anything of the matter ; but when he entered the drawing - room before dinner , the buzz of discussion was high between Tom , Maria , and Mr. Yates ; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him the agreeable news .

Mr. Rushworth	agent	much	But I do not much like the idea of being so fine . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	know	I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	followed	In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter ; and being accompanied by Mr. Yates , and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth , Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying , “ I can not , before Mr. Yates , speak what I feel as to this play , without reflecting on his friends at Ecclesford ; but I must now , my dear Maria , tell _ you _ , that I think it exceedingly unfit for private representation , and that I hope you will give it up .

Mr. Rushworth	agent	chose	“ You chose very wisely , I am sure , ” replied Miss Crawford , with a brightened look ; “ Anhalt is a heavy part . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	returned	“ _ The _ _ Count _ has two - and - forty speeches , ” returned Mr. Rushworth , “ which is no trifle . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	cried	It need not frighten you : it is a nothing of a part , a mere nothing , not above half a dozen speeches altogether , and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say ; so you may be as creep - mouse as you like , but we must have you to look at . ” “ If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches , ” cried Mr. Rushworth , “ what would you do with such a part as mine ? 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	have	I have forty - two to learn . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	comes	“ Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home , ” said Mary , after a pause . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	get	She knew , also , that poor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him : _ his _ complaint came before her as well as the rest ; and so decided to her eye was her cousin Maria ’s avoidance of him , and so needlessly often the rehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford , that she had soon all the terror of other complaints from _ him _ . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	turned	Mr. Yates , indeed , exclaimed against his tameness and insipidity ; and the day came at last , when Mr. Rushworth turned to her with a black look , and said , “ Do you think there is anything so very fine in all this ?

Mr. Rushworth	agent	attaining	From this moment there was a return of his former jealousy , which Maria , from increasing hopes of Crawford , was at little pains to remove ; and the chances of Mr. Rushworth ’s ever attaining to the knowledge of his two - and - forty speeches became much less . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	began	I thought he began to look a little queer , so I turned it off as well as I could , by whispering to him , ‘ We shall have an excellent Agatha ; there is something so _ maternal _ in her manner , so completely _ maternal _ in her voice and countenance . ’ 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	brightened	He brightened up directly . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	imagine	Mr. Yates might consider it only as a vexatious interruption for the evening , and Mr. Rushworth might imagine it a blessing ; but every other heart was

Mr. Rushworth	agent	think	I think we are a great deal better employed , sitting comfortably here among ourselves , and doing nothing . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	knew	Mr. Rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning ; but by looking , as he really felt , most exceedingly pleased with Sir Thomas ’s good opinion , and saying scarcely anything , he did his best towards preserving that good opinion a little longer .

Mr. Rushworth	agent	has	He is not a shining character , but he has a thousand good qualities ; and is so disposed to look up to you , that I am quite laughed at about it , for everybody considers it as my doing .

Mr. Rushworth	agent	met	I am sorry for them all , and would give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met . ” In this quarter , indeed , disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	improve	Mr. Rushworth must and would improve in good society ; and if Maria could now speak so securely of her happiness with him , speaking certainly without the prejudice , the blindness of love , she ought to be believed . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	used	Nothing could be objected to when it came under the discussion of the neighbourhood , except that the carriage which conveyed the bride and bridegroom and Julia from the church - door to Sotherton was the same chaise which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelvemonth before . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	disposed	Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might depend on , when she was stopped by Sir Thomas ’s saying with authority , “ I do not advise your going to Brighton , William , as I trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting ; but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere ; and you will find Mr. Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	had	I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society ; and with such encouragement , a man like Crawford , lively , and it may be , a little unthinking , might be led on to — there could be nothing very striking , because it is clear that he had no pretensions : his heart was reserved for you . 
Mr. Rushworth	agent	think	” “ I am persuaded that he does not think , as he ought , on serious subjects . ” “ Say , rather , that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects , which I believe to be a good deal the case .

Mr. Rushworth	patient	struck	Mr. Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of Miss Bertram , and , being inclined to marry , soon fancied himself in love . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	marry	Being now in her twenty - first year , Maria Bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty ; and as a marriage with Mr. Rushworth would give her the enjoyment of a larger income than her father ’s , as well as ensure her the house in town , which was now a prime object , it became , by the same rule of moral obligation , her evident duty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she could . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	mentioned	I could see it in her eyes , when he was mentioned . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	manage	“ Mary , how shall we manage him ? ” “ We must leave him to himself , I believe . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	leave	“ Mary , how shall we manage him ? ” “ We must leave him to himself , I believe . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	observing	She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upper end of the table , and in observing Mr. Rushworth , who was now making his appearance at Mansfield for the first time since the Crawfords ’ arrival . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	returned	He had been visiting a friend in the neighbouring county , and that friend having recently had his grounds laid out by an improver , Mr. Rushworth was returned with his head full of the subject , and very eager to be improving his own place in the same way ; and though not saying much to the purpose , could talk of nothing else . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	oblige	Miss Bertram ’s attention and opinion was evidently his chief aim ; and though her deportment showed rather conscious superiority than any solicitude to oblige him , the mention of Sotherton Court , and the ideas attached to it , 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	help	I hope I shall have some good friend to help me . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	influence	“ I do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth , ” he continued ; “ but , had I a place to new fashion , I should not put myself into the hands of an improver .

Mr. Rushworth	patient	escorting	CHAPTER VIII Fanny ’s rides recommenced the very next day ; and as it was a pleasant fresh - feeling morning , less hot than the weather had lately been , Edmund trusted that her losses , both of health and pleasure , would be soon made good . While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived , escorting his mother , who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially , in urging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton , which had been started a fortnight before , and which , in consequence of her subsequent absence from home , had since lain dormant . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	suit	inquire whether Wednesday would suit him or not . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	met	Having been out some time , and taken a different route to the house , they had not met him . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	speak	Miss Bertram could now speak with decided information of what she had known nothing about when Mr. Rushworth had asked her opinion ; and her spirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish , when they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal entrance . CHAPTER IX Mr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady ; and the whole party were welcomed by him with due attention . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	gone	“ It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now , as we are so far from the house already , ” said Mr. Crawford , when he was gone . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	entertain	I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish anecdotes during a ten miles ’ drive . ” “ Naturally , I believe , I am as lively as Julia , but I have more to think of now . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	tell	“ Or if we are , Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll : the grove of oak on the knoll . ”

Mr. Rushworth	patient	expected	She expected Mr. Rushworth , but it was Julia , who , hot and out of breath , and with a look of disappointment , cried out on seeing her , “ Heyday ! 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	seen	Julia was vexed , and her temper was hasty ; but she felt that it would not last , and therefore , taking no notice , only asked her if she had not seen Mr. Rushworth . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	saw	“ Yes , yes , we saw him . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	seeing	The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of seeing Mr. Rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their continued absence , however , as she might have done . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	charged	“ They desired me to stay — my cousin Maria charged me to say that you would find them at that knoll , or thereabouts . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	worked	Mr. Rushworth was worked on . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	letting	And letting himself out , he walked off without farther ceremony .

Mr. Rushworth	patient	direct	He had the offer of Count Cassel and Anhalt , and at first did not know which to chuse , and wanted Miss Bertram to direct him ; but upon being made to understand the different style of the characters , and which was which , and recollecting that he had once seen the play in London , and had thought Anhalt a very stupid fellow , he soon decided for the Count . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	know	I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak . ” 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	answer	Edmund could not answer him . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	put	When Sir Thomas comes , I dare say he will be in for some borough , but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing anything yet .

Mr. Rushworth	patient	liking	There was nothing disagreeable in Mr. Rushworth ’s appearance , and Sir Thomas was liking him already . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	value	He was aware that he must not expect a genius in Mr. Rushworth ; but as a well - judging , steady young man , with better notions than his elocution would do justice to , he intended to value him very highly . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	like	“ Yes , indeed , and the more you know of him the better you will like him . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	like	I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr. Rushworth . ”

Mr. Rushworth	patient	like	She could not , did not like him . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	knowing	Mr. Rushworth had , perhaps , been accepted on too short an acquaintance , and , on knowing him better , she was repenting . 
Mr. Rushworth	patient	raised	And I must say , that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion .

Mrs. Grant	agent	gave	The Doctor was very fond of eating , and would have a good dinner every day ; and Mrs. Grant , instead of contriving to gratify him at little expense , gave her cook as high wages as they did at Mansfield Park , and was scarcely ever seen in her offices .

Mrs. Grant	agent	filled	delighted in the boy , Mrs. Crawford doted on the girl ; and it was the lady ’s death which now obliged her _ protegee _ , after some months ’ further trial at her uncle ’s house , to find another home . Admiral Crawford was a man of vicious conduct , who chose , instead of retaining his niece , to bring his mistress under his own roof ; and to this Mrs. Grant was indebted for her sister ’s proposal of coming to her , a measure quite as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the other ; for Mrs. Grant , having by this time run through the usual resources of ladies residing in the country without a family of children — having more than filled her favourite sitting - room with pretty furniture , and made a choice collection of plants and poultry — was very much in want of some variety at home .

Mrs. Grant	agent	said	“ No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present , ” said Mrs. Grant to Mrs. Norris , with a smile ; “ but depend upon it , Sotherton will have _ every _ improvement in time which his heart can desire . ” “ I must try to do something with it , ” said Mr. Rushworth , “ but I do not know what . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	said	“ The truth is , ma’am , ” said Mrs. Grant , pretending to whisper across the table to Mrs. Norris , “ that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is : he is scarcely ever indulged with one , for it is so valuable a fruit ; with a little assistance , and ours is such a remarkably large , fair sort , that what with early tarts and preserves , my cook contrives to get them all . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	help	The subject of improving grounds , meanwhile , was still under consideration among the others ; and Mrs. Grant could not help addressing her brother , though it was calling his attention from Miss Julia Bertram . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	enforced	Mrs. Grant , hearing the latter part of this speech , enforced it warmly , persuaded that no judgment could be equal to her brother ’s ; and as Miss Bertram caught at the idea likewise , and gave it her full support , declaring that , in her opinion , it was infinitely better to consult with friends and disinterested advisers , than immediately to throw the business into the hands of a professional man , Mr. Rushworth was very ready to request the favour of Mr. Crawford ’s assistance ; and 
Mrs. Grant	agent	telling	She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common : Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views , and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	have	She has a great desire to get as far as Mansfield Common : Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its fine views , and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	done	It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant , with perfect good - humour , on Mr. Rushworth ’s account , who was partly expected at the Park that day ; but it was felt as a very grievous injury , and her good manners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	came	Before his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	coming	Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next , under the conviction that everybody must be wanting to see Sotherton , to include Miss Crawford in the invitation ; and though Mrs. Grant , who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs. Rushworth , on her coming into the neighbourhood , civilly declined it on her own account , she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister ; and Mary , properly pressed and persuaded , was not long in accepting her share of the civility . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	offered	Mrs. Grant offered herself as companion for the day to Lady Bertram in lieu of her son , and Dr. Grant was to join them at dinner . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	spoke	Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangement which restored him to his share of the party ; and Mrs. Norris thought it an excellent plan , and had it at her tongue ’s end , and was on the point of proposing it , when Mrs. Grant spoke . Wednesday was fine , and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived , Mr. Crawford driving his sisters ; and as everybody was ready , there was nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take their places .

Mrs. Grant	agent	saying	While each of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best , and with the most appearance of obliging the others , to secure it , the matter was settled by Mrs. Grant ’s saying , as she stepped from the carriage , “ As there are five of you , it will be better that one should sit with Henry ; and as you were saying lately that you wished you could drive , Julia , I think this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson .

Mrs. Grant	agent	wished	Julia might be justified in so doing by the hints of Mrs. Grant , inclined to credit what she wished , and Maria by the hints of Mr. Crawford himself .

Mrs. Grant	agent	had	Mrs. Grant was of consequence : _ her _ good - nature had honourable mention ; her taste and her time were considered ; her presence was wanted ; she was sought for , and attended , and praised ; and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her the character she had accepted . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	condemn	But reflection brought better feelings , and shewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect , which could never have belonged to _ her _ ; and that , had she received even the greatest , she could never have been easy in joining a scheme which , considering only her uncle , she must condemn altogether . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	sat	She either sat in gloomy silence , wrapt in such gravity as nothing could subdue , no curiosity touch , no wit amuse ; or allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates , was talking with forced gaiety to him alone , and ridiculing the acting of the others .

Mrs. Grant	agent	think	I do not think we do so well without him . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	think	, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant . ” “ I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth ’s chance if Henry stept in before the articles were signed . ” “ If you have such a suspicion , something must be done ; and as soon as the play is all over , we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind ; and if he means nothing , we will send him off , though he is Henry , for a time . ” 
Mrs. Grant	agent	discerned	Julia _ did _ suffer , however , though Mrs. Grant discerned it not , and though it escaped the notice of many of her own family likewise .

Mrs. Grant	agent	shewn	The memory is sometimes so retentive , so serviceable , so obedient ; at others , so bewildered and so weak ; and at others again , so tyrannic , so beyond control ! We are , to be sure , a miracle every way ; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out . ” Miss Crawford , untouched and inattentive , had nothing to say ; and Fanny , perceiving it , brought back her own mind to what she thought must interest . “ It may seem impertinent in _ me _ to praise , but I must admire the taste Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	detest	There is something in the sound of Mr. _ Edmund _ Bertram so formal , so pitiful , so younger - brother - like , that I detest it . ” 
Mrs. Grant	agent	cried	“ They can not have been sitting long , ” cried Mrs. Grant , “ for when I went up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window , and then they were walking . ” “ And really , ” added Edmund , “ the day is so mild , that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent .

Mrs. Grant	agent	asked	She used to ask your sisters now and then , but she never asked Fanny .

Mrs. Grant	agent	asked	Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	used	He told the whole ; and she had only to add , “ So strange ! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her . ” “ But is it not very natural , ” observed Edmund , “ that Mrs. Grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister ? ” “ Nothing can be more natural , ” said Sir Thomas , after a short deliberation ; “ nor , were there no sister in the case , could anything , in my opinion , be more natural . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	thinks	Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to _ us _ to take a little notice of you , or else it would never have come into her head , and you may be very certain that , if your cousin Julia had been at home , you would not have been asked at all .

Mrs. Grant	agent	occupied	Here he was again on the same ground where all had passed before , and apparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams , as if he had never known Mansfield in any other state . She heard them spoken of by him only in a general way , till they were all re - assembled in the drawing - room , when Edmund , being engaged apart in some matter of business with Dr. Grant , which seemed entirely to engross them , and Mrs. Grant occupied at the tea - table , he began talking of them with more particularity to his other sister . 
Mrs. Grant	agent	hope	Twice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of his lady , but in vain ; no pause was long enough for the time his measured manner needed ; and very little of her state could be known till Mrs. Grant was able , at the end of the first rubber , to go to her and pay her compliments . “ I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game . ” 
Mrs. Grant	agent	know	I do not know what it is all about .

Mrs. Grant	agent	gone	Mrs. Grant , with a temper to love and be loved , must have gone with some regret from the scenes and people she had been used to ; but the same happiness of disposition must in any place , and any society , secure her a great deal to enjoy , and she had again a home to offer Mary ; and Mary had had enough of her own friends , enough of vanity , ambition , love , and disappointment in the course of the last half - year , to be in need of the true kindness of her sister ’s heart , and the rational tranquillity of her ways .

Mrs. Grant	patient	settled	She could not enter into the wrongs of an economist , but she felt all the injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant ’s being so well settled in life without being handsome , and expressed her astonishment on that point almost as often , though not so diffusely , as Mrs. Norris discussed the other . These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event arose of such importance in the family , as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies . 
Mrs. Grant	patient	assure	I assure you he is very detestable ; the Admiral ’s lessons have quite spoiled him . ” 
Mrs. Grant	patient	delighted	It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both with her , and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so : a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society to an indolent , stay - at - home man ; and Mr. Crawford ’s being his guest was an excuse for drinking claret every day 
Mrs. Grant	patient	attend	Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning ; she would gladly have been there too , might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed , to hear the harp ; neither could she wonder that , when the evening stroll was over , and the two families parted again , he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home , while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park ; but she thought it a very bad exchange ; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and water for her , would rather go without it than not . 
Mrs. Grant	patient	offered	Mrs. Grant offered herself as companion for the day to Lady Bertram in lieu of her son , and Dr. Grant was to join them at dinner . 
Mrs. Grant	patient	sought	Mrs. Grant was of consequence : _ her _ good - nature had honourable mention ; her taste and her time were considered ; her presence was wanted ; she was sought for , and attended , and praised ; and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her the character she had accepted .

Mrs. Grant	patient	used	The sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become her greatest enemy : they were alienated from each other ; and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the attentions which were still carrying on there , some punishment to Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr. Rushworth . 
Mrs. Grant	patient	engaged	The first regular rehearsal of the three first acts was certainly to take place in the evening : Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords were engaged to return for that purpose as soon as they could after dinner ; and every one concerned was looking forward with eagerness . 
Mrs. Grant	patient	put	“ And I do believe she can say every word of it , ” added Maria , “ for she could put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places . 
Mrs. Grant	patient	persuade	Mrs. Grant , really eager to get any change for her sister , could , by the easiest self - deceit , persuade herself that she was doing the kindest thing by Fanny , and giving her the most important opportunities of improvement in pressing her frequent calls . 
Mrs. Grant	patient	grant	“ I grant you the name is good in itself , and _ Lord _ Edmund or _ Sir _ Edmund sound delightfully ; but sink it under the chill , the annihilation of a Mr. , and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas . 
Mrs. Grant	patient	tell	He had since heard her express herself differently , with other feelings , more chequered feelings : he had heard her tell Mrs. Grant that she should leave her with regret ; that she began to believe neither the friends nor the pleasures she was going to were worth those she left behind ; and that though she felt she must go , and knew she should enjoy herself when once away , she was already looking forward to being at Mansfield again . Was there not a “ yes ” in all this ? 
Mrs. Grant	patient	leaving	I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near .

Susan Price	agent	acknowledged	She acknowledged her fears , blamed herself for having contended so warmly ; and from that hour Fanny , understanding the worth of her disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined to seek her good opinion and refer to her judgment , began to feel again the blessing of affection , and to entertain the hope of being useful to a mind so much in need of help , and so much deserving it .

Susan Price	agent	formed	Her greatest wonder on the subject soon became — not that Susan should have been provoked into disrespect and impatience against her better knowledge — but that so much better knowledge , so many good notions should have been hers at all ; and that , brought up in the midst of negligence and error , she should have formed such proper opinions of what ought to be ; she , who had had no cousin Edmund to direct her thoughts or fix her principles . 
Susan Price	agent	learned	By sitting together upstairs , they avoided a great deal of the disturbance of the house ; Fanny had peace , and Susan learned to think it no misfortune to be quietly employed . They sat without a fire ; but that was a privation familiar even to Fanny , and she suffered the less because reminded by it of the East room .

Susan Price	agent	preparing	One morning , about this time , Fanny having now been nearly four weeks from Mansfield , a point which she never failed to think over and calculate every day , as she and Susan were preparing to remove , as usual , upstairs , they were stopped by the knock of a visitor , whom they felt they could not avoid , from Rebecca ’s alertness in going to the door , a duty which always interested her beyond any other . 
Susan Price	agent	walking	And the consequence was , that Fanny , strange as it was — strange , awkward , and distressing — found herself and Susan , within ten minutes , walking towards the High Street with Mr. Crawford . 
Susan Price	agent	have	He must content himself with being only generally agreeable , and letting Susan have her share of entertainment , with the indulgence , now and then , of a look or hint for the better - informed and conscious Fanny . 
Susan Price	agent	growing	Susan was growing very fond of her , and though without any of the early delight in books which had been so strong in Fanny , with a disposition much less inclined to sedentary pursuits , or to information for information ’s sake , she had so strong a desire of not _ appearing _ ignorant , as , with a good clear understanding , made her a most attentive , profitable , thankful pupil . 
Susan Price	agent	prepared	Within twenty - four hours she was hoping to be gone ; her father and mother must be spoken to , Susan prepared , everything got ready . 
Susan Price	agent	going	The happiness she was imparting , too , happiness very little alloyed by the black communication which must briefly precede it — the joyful consent of her father and mother to Susan ’s going with her — the general satisfaction with which the going of both seemed regarded , and the ecstasy of Susan herself , was all serving to support her spirits . 
Susan Price	agent	go	Does Susan go ? ” were questions following each other rapidly . 
Susan Price	agent	feel	Fanny began to dread the meeting with her aunts and Tom , under so dreadful a humiliation ; and Susan to feel with some anxiety , that all her best manners , all her lately acquired knowledge of what was practised here , was on the point of being called into action . 
Susan Price	agent	had	She had not spirits to notice her in more than a few repulsive looks , but she felt her as a spy , and an intruder , and an indigent niece , and everything most odious .

She was now left a good deal to herself , to get acquainted with the house and grounds as she could , and spent her days very happily in so doing , while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut up , or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them , at this time , for everything like comfort ; Edmund trying to bury his own feelings in exertions for the relief of his brother ’s , and Fanny

Susan Price	agent	remained	But it was possible to part with her , because Susan remained to supply her place . 
Susan Price	agent	became	Susan became the stationary niece , delighted to be so ; and equally well adapted for it by a readiness of mind , and an inclination for usefulness , as Fanny had been by sweetness of temper , and strong feelings of gratitude . 
Susan Price	patient	checked	it was not such a home , she had not such a welcome , as — she checked herself ; she was unreasonable . 
Susan Price	patient	find	Susan had an open , sensible countenance ; she was like William , and Fanny hoped to find her like him in disposition and goodwill towards herself . 
Susan Price	patient	sent	But you should not have taken it out , my dear , when I sent you to the drawer . 
Susan Price	patient	told	You know I told you not to touch it , because Susan is so cross about it . 
Susan Price	patient	Let	she could but just speak to be heard , and she said so prettily , ‘ Let sister Susan have my knife , mama , when I am dead and buried .

In every argument with her mother , Susan had in point of reason the advantage , and never was there any maternal tenderness to buy her off . 
Susan Price	patient	placed	All this became gradually evident , and gradually placed Susan before her sister as an object of mingled compassion and respect . 
Susan Price	patient	worked	Her influence , or at least the consciousness and use of it , originated in an act of kindness by Susan , which , after many hesitations of delicacy , she at last worked herself up to . 
Susan Price	patient	elevate	But she was so wholly unused to confer favours , except on the very poor , so unpractised in removing evils , or bestowing kindnesses among her equals , and so fearful of appearing to elevate herself as a great lady at home , that it took some time to determine that it would not be unbecoming in her to make such a present . 
Susan Price	patient	established	It was made , however , at last : a silver knife was bought for Betsey , and accepted with great delight , its newness giving it every advantage over the other that could be desired ; Susan was established in the full possession of her own , Betsey handsomely declaring that now she had got one so much prettier herself , she should never want _ that _ again ; and no reproach seemed conveyed to the equally satisfied mother , which Fanny had almost feared to be impossible . 
Susan Price	patient	blamed	She acknowledged her fears , blamed herself for having contended so warmly ; and from that hour Fanny , understanding the worth of her disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined to seek her good opinion and refer to her judgment , began to feel again the blessing of affection , and to entertain the hope of being useful to a mind so much in need of help , and so much deserving it .

Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her elder sister ; and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this , she began to feel that when her own release from Portsmouth came , her happiness would have a material drawback in leaving Susan behind .

Mr. Yates	agent	talking	Mr. Yates was still talking . 
Mr. Yates	agent	beginning	Mr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas ’s intentions , though as far as ever from understanding their source . 
Mr. Yates	agent	felt	Mr. Yates felt it as acutely as might be supposed . 
Mr. Yates	agent	believed	To be a second time disappointed in the same way was an instance of very severe ill - luck ; and his indignation was such , that had it not been for delicacy towards his friend , and his friend ’s youngest sister , he believed he should certainly attack the baronet on the absurdity of his proceedings , and argue him into a little more rationality .

Mr. Yates	agent	known	He had known many disagreeable fathers before , and often been struck with the inconveniences they occasioned , but never , in the whole course of his life , had he seen one of that class so unintelligibly moral , so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas .

Mr. Yates	agent	mean	He was not a man to be endured but for his children ’s sake , and he might be thankful to his fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates did yet mean to stay a few days longer under his roof . 
Mr. Yates	agent	having	Sir Thomas had been quite indifferent to Mr. Crawford ’s going or staying : but his good wishes for Mr. Yates ’s having a pleasant journey , as he walked with him to the hall - door , were given with genuine satisfaction . 
Mr. Yates	agent	left	Mr. Yates had staid to see the destruction of every theatrical preparation at Mansfield , the removal of everything appertaining to the play : he left the house in all the soberness of its general character ; and 
Mr. Yates	agent	make	Well , I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever want him to make two - and - forty speeches to her ” ; adding , with a momentary seriousness , “ She is too good for him — much too good . ” 
Mr. Yates	agent	learn	Your kindness and patience can never be forgotten , your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part — in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied — to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own ! 
Mr. Yates	patient	invited	Mr. Bertram ’s acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth , where they had spent ten days together in the same society , and the friendship , if friendship it might be called , had been proved and perfected by Mr. Yates ’s being invited to take Mansfield in his way , whenever he could , and by his promising to come ; and he did come rather earlier than had been expected , in consequence of the sudden breaking - up of a large party assembled for gaiety at the house of another friend , which he had left Weymouth to join . 
Mr. Yates	patient	chuse	Whichever Mr. Yates did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him , and a short parley of compliment ensued . 
Mr. Yates	patient	fit	Miss Bertram , feeling all the interest of an Agatha in the question , took on her to decide it , by observing to Mr. Yates that this was a point in which height and figure ought to be considered , and that _ his _ being the tallest , seemed to fit him peculiarly for the Baron . 
Mr. Yates	patient	disappointed	_ She _ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant dreadfully ; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford ; that Tom Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible ; that Mrs. Grant spoiled everything by laughing ; that Edmund was behindhand with his part , and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth , who was wanting a prompter through every speech . 
Mr. Yates	patient	heard	I heard him as I came upstairs , and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers , Agatha and Frederick . 
Mr. Yates	patient	fetch	“ I will go and fetch him . 
Mr. Yates	patient	received	Sir Thomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which was due to his own character , but was really as far from pleased with the necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner of its commencement . 
Mr. Yates	patient	gone	Another day or two , and Mr. Yates was gone likewise . 
Mr. Yates	patient	seeing	Sir Thomas hoped , in seeing him out of it , to be rid of the worst object connected with the scheme , and the last that must be inevitably reminding him of its existence . 
Mr. Yates	patient	reminding	Sir Thomas hoped , in seeing him out of it , to be rid of the worst object connected with the scheme , and the last that must be inevitably reminding him of its existence . 
Mr. Yates	patient	distressed	Mrs. Norris contrived to remove one article from his sight that might have distressed him . 
Mr. Yates	patient	see	I see him now — his toil and his despair . 
Mr. Yates	patient	received	She was humble , and wishing to be forgiven ; and Mr. Yates , desirous of being really received into the family , was disposed to look up to him and be guided . 
Mr. Yates	patient	accepting	She had been allowing his attentions some time , but with very little idea of ever accepting him ; and had not her sister ’s conduct burst forth as it did , 
Mrs. Price	agent	wrote	To save herself from useless remonstrance , Mrs. Price never wrote to her family on the subject till actually married . 
Mrs. Price	agent	afford	By the end of eleven years , however , Mrs. Price could no longer afford to cherish pride or resentment , or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her . 
Mrs. Price	agent	sacrificed	A large and still increasing family , an husband disabled for active service , but not the less equal to company and good liquor , and a very small income to supply their wants , made her eager to regain the friends she had so carelessly sacrificed ; and she addressed Lady Bertram in a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence , such a superfluity of children , and such a want of almost everything else , as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation .

Mrs. Price	agent	felt	, she could not conceal how important she felt they might be to the future maintenance of the eight already in being . 
Mrs. Price	agent	do	Her eldest was a boy of ten years old , a fine spirited fellow , who longed to be out in the world ; but what could she do ? 
Mrs. Price	agent	seemed	Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised that a girl should be fixed on , when she had so many fine boys , but accepted the offer most thankfully , assuring them of her daughter ’s being a very well - disposed , good - humoured girl , and trusting they would never have cause to throw her off .

Mrs. Price	agent	spoke	She spoke of her farther as somewhat delicate and puny , but was sanguine in the hope of her being materially better for change of air . 
Mrs. Price	agent	thought	she probably thought change of air might agree with many of her children . 
Mrs. Price	agent	kissed	Come , mother , you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny yet . ” In they both came , and Mrs. Price having kindly kissed her daughter again , and commented a little on her growth , began with very natural solicitude to feel for their fatigues and wants as travellers . 
Mrs. Price	agent	began	I began to think you would never come . 
Mrs. Price	agent	watching	Betsey and I have been watching for you this half - hour . 
Mrs. Price	agent	tell	I could not tell whether you would be for some meat , or only a dish of tea , after your journey , or else I would have got something ready . 
Mrs. Price	agent	went	Mrs. Price , Rebecca , and Betsey all went up to defend themselves , all talking together , but Rebecca loudest , and the job was to be done as well as it could in a great hurry ; William trying in vain to send Betsey down again , or keep her from being troublesome where she was ; the whole of which , as almost every door in the house was open , could be plainly distinguished in the parlour , except when drowned at intervals by the superior noise of Sam , Tom , and Charles chasing each other up and down stairs , and tumbling about and hallooing . Fanny was almost stunned . 
Mrs. Price	agent	walked	Something like tranquillity might now be hoped for ; and accordingly , when Rebecca had been prevailed on to carry away the tea - things , and Mrs. Price had walked about the room some time looking for a shirt - sleeve , which Betsey at last hunted out from a drawer in the kitchen , the small party of females were pretty well composed , and the mother having lamented again over the impossibility of getting Sam ready in time , was at leisure to think of her eldest daughter and the friends she had come from . 
Mrs. Price	agent	cried	“ Her year ! ” cried Mrs. Price ; “ I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her before she has staid a year , for that will not be up till November . 
Mrs. Price	agent	hope	“ Her year ! ” cried Mrs. Price ; “ I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her before she has staid a year , for that will not be up till November .

Mrs. Price	agent	get	I have no hope of ever being settled ; and if I was to part with Rebecca , I should only get something worse . 
Mrs. Price	agent	think	And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress to please ; and I am sure the place is easy enough , 
Mrs. Price	agent	do	for there is always a girl under her , and I often do half the work myself 
Mrs. Price	agent	cried	“ Now , Susan , ” cried Mrs. Price , in a complaining voice , “ now , how can you be so cross ? 
Mrs. Price	agent	wish	I wish you would not be so quarrelsome . 
Mrs. Price	agent	sent	But you should not have taken it out , my dear , when I sent you to the drawer . 
Mrs. Price	agent	told	You know I told you not to touch it , because Susan is so cross about it . 
Mrs. Price	agent	hide	I must hide it another time , Betsey . 
Mrs. Price	agent	had	Her heart and her time were already quite full ; she had neither leisure nor affection to bestow on Fanny . 
Mrs. Price	agent	regarded	of her girls whom she had ever much regarded 
Mrs. Price	agent	resembled	Of her two sisters , Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram than Mrs. Norris . 
Mrs. Price	agent	scruple	She might scruple to make use of the words , but she must and did feel that her mother was a partial , ill - judging parent , a dawdle , a slattern , who neither taught nor restrained her children , whose house was the scene of mismanagement and discomfort from beginning to end , and who had no talent , no conversation , no affection towards herself ; no curiosity to know her better , no desire of her friendship , and no inclination for her company that could lessen her sense of such feelings .

Mrs. Price	agent	tire	They talked of William , a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire ; and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart could wish . 
Mrs. Price	agent	stirred	Mrs. Price , it appeared , scarcely ever stirred out of doors , except of a Sunday ; she owned she could seldom , with her large family , find time for a walk . 
Mrs. Price	agent	owned	Mrs. Price , it appeared , scarcely ever stirred out of doors , except of a Sunday ; she owned she could seldom , with her large family , find time for a walk . 
Mrs. Price	agent	persuade	“ Would she not , then , persuade her daughters to take advantage of such weather , and allow him the pleasure of attending them ? ” 
Mrs. Price	agent	knew	“ Her daughters were very much confined ; Portsmouth was a sad place ; they did not often get out ; and she knew they had some errands in the town , which they would be very glad to do . 
Mrs. Price	agent	saw	But Sunday made her a very creditable and tolerably cheerful - looking Mrs. Price , coming abroad with a fine family of children , feeling a little respite of her weekly cares , and only discomposed if she saw her boys run into danger , or Rebecca pass by with a flower in her hat . 
Mrs. Price	agent	took	Mrs. Price took her weekly walk on the ramparts every fine Sunday throughout the year , always going directly after morning service and staying till dinner - time . 
Mrs. Price	agent	met	It was her public place : there she met her acquaintance , heard a little news , talked over the badness of the Portsmouth servants , and wound up her spirits for the six days ensuing . 
Mrs. Price	agent	saw	Nobody else could be interested in so remote an evil as illness in a family above an hundred miles off ; not even Mrs. Price , beyond a brief question or two , if she saw her daughter with a letter in her hand , and now and then the quiet observation of , “ My poor sister Bertram must be in a great deal of trouble . ” 
Mrs. Price	agent	did	Mrs. Price did quite as much for Lady Bertram as Lady Bertram would have done for Mrs. Price . 
Mrs. Price	agent	hope	“ Indeed , I hope it is not true , ” said Mrs. Price plaintively ; “ it would be so very shocking ! 
Mrs. Price	agent	said	“ Indeed , I hope it is not true , ” said Mrs. Price plaintively ; “ it would be so very shocking ! 
Mrs. Price	agent	spoken	If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that carpet 
Mrs. Price	agent	spoke	, I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times ; have not I , Betsey ? 
Mrs. Price	agent	have	, I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times ; have not I , Betsey ? 
Mrs. Price	agent	overlooked	She had , indeed , scarcely the shadow of a hope to soothe her mind , and was reduced to so low and wan and trembling a condition , as no mother , not unkind , except Mrs. Price could have overlooked , when the third day did bring the sickening knock , and a letter was again put into her hands . 
Mrs. Price	agent	talked	Mrs. Price talked of her poor sister for a few minutes , but how to find anything to hold Susan ’s clothes , because Rebecca took away all the boxes and spoilt them , was much more in her thoughts : 
Mrs. Price	patient	assist	By the end of eleven years , however , Mrs. Price could no longer afford to cherish pride or resentment , or to lose one connexion that might possibly assist her . 
Mrs. Price	patient	relieved	Mrs. Norris was often observing to the others that she could not get her poor sister and her family out of her head , and that , much as they had all done for her , she seemed to be wanting to do more ; and at length she could not but own it to be her wish that poor Mrs. Price should be relieved from the charge and expense of one child entirely out of her great number . 
Mrs. Price	patient	throw	Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised that a girl should be fixed on , when she had so many fine boys , but accepted the offer most thankfully , assuring them of her daughter ’s being a very well - disposed , good - humoured girl , and trusting they would never have cause to throw her off . 
Mrs. Price	patient	assisted	Amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested , Sir Thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of Mrs. Price : he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of her sons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit ; and Fanny , though almost totally separated from her family , was sensible of the truest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them , or of anything at all promising in their situation or conduct . 
Mrs. Price	patient	rid	“ Her year ! ” cried Mrs. Price ; “ I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her before she has staid a year , for that will not be up till November . 
Mrs. Price	patient	gave	Poor Mary little thought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep , only two hours before she died . 
Mrs. Price	patient	placed	Her disposition was naturally easy and indolent , like Lady Bertram ’s ; and a situation of similar affluence and do - nothingness would have been much more suited to her capacity than the exertions and self - denials of the one which her imprudent marriage had placed her in . 
Mrs. Price	patient	persuade	“ Would she not , then , persuade her daughters to take advantage of such weather , and allow him the pleasure of attending them ? ” 
Mrs. Price	patient	met	It was her public place : there she met her acquaintance , heard a little news , talked over the badness of the Portsmouth servants , and wound up her spirits for the six days ensuing . 
Dr. Grant	agent	sent	Mrs. Norris could not help thinking that some steady old thing might be found among the numbers belonging to the Park that would do vastly well ; or that one might be borrowed of the steward ; or that perhaps Dr. Grant might now and then lend them the pony he sent to the post . 
Dr. Grant	agent	believe	“ My dear brother , I will not believe this of you . ” 
Dr. Grant	agent	assure	I assure you he is very detestable ; the Admiral ’s lessons have quite spoiled him . ” 
Dr. Grant	agent	congratulated	Dr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford on feeling no disinclination to the state herself . 
Dr. Grant	agent	done	If it had not been for _ that _ , we should have carried on the garden wall , and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard , just as Dr. Grant has done . 
Dr. Grant	agent	replied	“ The tree thrives well , beyond a doubt , madam , ” replied Dr. Grant . 
Dr. Grant	agent	pass	soil is good ; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering . 
Dr. Grant	agent	saw	“ Sir , it is a Moor Park , we bought it as a Moor Park , and it cost us — that is , it was a present from Sir Thomas , but I saw the bill — and I know it cost seven shillings , and was charged as a Moor Park . 
Dr. Grant	agent	replied	“ You were imposed on , ma’am , ” replied Dr. Grant : “ these potatoes have as much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree . It is an insipid fruit at the best ; but a good apricot is eatable , which none from my garden are . 
Dr. Grant	agent	knows	“ The truth is , ma’am , ” said Mrs. Grant , pretending to whisper across the table to Mrs. Norris , “ that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is : he is scarcely ever indulged with one , for it is so valuable a fruit ; with a little assistance , and ours is such a remarkably large , fair sort , that what with early tarts and preserves , my cook contrives to get them all . 
Dr. Grant	agent	begun	Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris were seldom good friends ; their acquaintance had begun in dilapidations , and their habits were totally dissimilar . 
Dr. Grant	agent	doing	frame were not without their use : it was all in harmony ; and as everything will turn to account when love is once set going , even the sandwich tray , and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it , were worth looking at . 
Dr. Grant	agent	get	To own the truth , Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose , which he could not get the better of . 
Dr. Grant	agent	chosen	“ No , ” replied Fanny , “ but we need not give up his profession for all that ; because , whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen , he would have taken a — not a good temper into it ; and as he must , either in the navy or army , have had a great many more people under his command than he has now , I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman .

Dr. Grant	agent	had	Besides , I can not but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession , where he would have had less time and obligation — where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself , the _ frequency _ , at least , of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now .

Dr. Grant	agent	sent	He fancied it tough , sent away his plate , and has been suffering ever since ” . 
Dr. Grant	agent	read	The bride was elegantly dressed ; the two bridesmaids were duly inferior ; her father gave her away ; her mother stood with salts in her hand , expecting to be agitated ; her aunt tried to cry ; and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant . 
Dr. Grant	agent	went	A civil servant she had withstood ; but when Dr. Grant himself went out with an umbrella , there was nothing to be done but to be very much ashamed , and to get into the house as fast as possible ; and to poor Miss Crawford , who had just been contemplating the dismal rain in a very desponding state of mind , sighing over the ruin of all her plan of exercise for that morning , and of every chance of seeing a single creature beyond themselves for the next twenty - four hours , the 
Dr. Grant	agent	enjoy	how much more Dr. Grant would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day , will not keep beyond to - morrow . 
Dr. Grant	agent	invited	In the moment of parting , Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant to eat his mutton with him the next day ; and Fanny had barely time for an unpleasant feeling on the occasion , when Mrs. Grant , with sudden recollection , turned to her and asked for the pleasure of her company too . 
Dr. Grant	agent	cried	“ Very well , very well , ” cried Dr. Grant , “ all the better ; I am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house . 
Dr. Grant	agent	suggested	She could not compliment the newly arrived gentleman , however , with any appearance of interest , in a scheme for extending his stay at Mansfield , and sending for his hunters from Norfolk , which , suggested by Dr. Grant , advised by Edmund , and warmly urged by the two sisters , was soon in possession of his mind , and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her 
Dr. Grant	agent	giving	Dr. Grant is giving Bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon . 
Dr. Grant	agent	feel	“ Will he not feel this ? ” thought Fanny . 
Dr. Grant	agent	feel	“ No , he can feel nothing as he ought . ” 
Dr. Grant	agent	came	Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity . ” “ Was Mrs. Grant in the room , then ? ” “ Yes , when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves ; and when once we had begun , we had not done with you , Fanny , till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in . 
Dr. Grant	agent	shew	Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister , and a certain consideration for her judgment , which makes one feel there _ is _ attachment ; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers .

Dr. Grant	agent	succeeded	Dr. Grant , through an interest on which he had almost ceased to form hopes , succeeded to a stall in Westminster , which , as affording an occasion for leaving Mansfield , an excuse for residence in London , and an increase of income to answer the expenses of the change , was highly acceptable to those who went and those who staid .

Dr. Grant	patient	having	The two sisters were so kind to her , and so pleasant , that Fanny might have enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way , and could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at the end of the hour , and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant ’s carriage and horses out to take her home , with which she was threatened . As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather might occasion at home , she had nothing to suffer on that score ; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts , she was perfectly aware that none would be felt , and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain , her being in such cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram . 
Dr. Grant	patient	commend	“ My dear child , commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St. Paul ’s , and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be . 
Dr. Grant	patient	eyeing	Miss Crawford , who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund , now observed , “ Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss . ” 
Dr. Grant	patient	leaving	As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford ’s behaviour ; but when the whist - table broke up at the end of the second rubber , and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their last play , he became a looker - on at the other , he found his niece the object of attentions , or rather of professions , of a somewhat pointed character . Henry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about Thornton Lacey ; and not being able to catch Edmund ’s ear , was detailing it to his fair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness .
